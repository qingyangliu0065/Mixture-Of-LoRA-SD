{"input": "Should I reference Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection in modules I create for Sitecore 8.2+?\n\nSo I'm in the process of upgrading various modules to Sitecore 8.2. Among other things this involves getting rid of IoC container project references and getting on board with the Sitecore one.\nAnd herein lies my question.\nIt seems to me that if I just add a reference to Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection I am really just replacing one DI reference with another one. Also; what if the main project that my module will plug into, has that container replaced - like with SimpleInjector or Unity or such?\nReading through Kam's post on DI in 8.2 it seems to me that the best approach for a module would be to use Direct Registration.  Like so:\n<configuration xmlns:patch=\"http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/\">\n    <sitecore>\n        <services>\n            <register \n                serviceType=\"Type.IName, Assembly\" \n                implementationType=\"Type.Name, Assembly\" \n                lifetime=\"Transient\" />\n        </services>\n    </sitecore>\n</configuration>\n\nDoing it like this is agnostic towards the actual container in use; saves me a project reference to any container. Seems like a win/win. But is it?\n\nWhen Sitecore gets reconfigured to use another container; will that container also be used to resolve these <register /> entries? (as opposed to what Kam suggests; resolve these via Reflection)\nAm I really not saving anything because Sitecore already references Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and one more reference from a module will make no difference at all?", "output": "When Sitecore gets reconfigured to use another container; will that container also be used to resolve these  entries?\n\nIt depends on how that other container gets configured, exactly. If you use the approach of patching the <serviceProviderBuilder>, then the container gets replaced completely and there's only one DI implementation. This would be my recommendation, as it seamlessly integrates your container into Sitecore. This way, the services that you configure with <services> –> <register> will be handled by your container of choice.\nOn the other hand, if you only replace the MVC dependency resolver, then there will be two containers: one used in Sitecore, and another in your application. Sure, you can manually copy all Sitecore service registrations into your container, but there will still be two containers running side-by-side.\n\nAm I really not saving anything because Sitecore already references Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and one more reference from a module will make no difference at all?\n\nThat's how I see it as well. The assembly will be loaded into memory anyway by Sitecore, so referencing it from your modules won't make anything worse.\nThe decision of whether to use code or XML configuration to register your services is a matter of personal preference.\n\nDoing it like this is agnostic towards the actual container in use; saves me a project reference to any container. Seems like a win/win. But is it?\n\nWell, it will be agnostic to the container, but instead it will be tied to Sitecore's XML registration format, which has even fewer features than IServiceProvider. If that works for you, then by all means, go ahead with it.\nJust keep in mind that this way you won't have an option to do things like mass-registration. E.g. with Autofac:\nbuilder\n    .RegisterAssemblyTypes(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies())\n    .Where(t =>t.GetInterfaces().Any(i => i.IsAssignableFrom(typeof(IService))))\n    .AsImplementedInterfaces()\n    .InstancePerLifetimeScope();", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Do you have any advice on how to attract an older guy successfully? Maybe a step-by-step guide with 13 steps?", "output": "Dating older men can be difficult, especially if the age difference is significant. You are most likely going to be into different things, and have different tastes. But, that doesn't mean you can't be compatible. If you find yourself attracted to an older man, act mature and approach him with confidence. If things work out, and you start dating, take some time to make sure your interests line up. Don't let age get in the way of a happy relationship.\n1. Go for a more mature look.: You can  attract a man without talking to him just by dressing up the right way. Looking more mature doesn't mean you need to look old. In fact, your youth is probably one of your most attractive qualities. Rather, it means picking a hairstyle that suits you rather than something wild, and switching out some of your less mature clothing for a more sophisticated look. Basically, you want to be well put together to attract an older guy.\n2. Act confident.: Nothing is as attractive as confidence. That means paying attention to your posture (sit up straight!). It also means looking him in the eye while you're talking to him and smiling. Try to keep yourself calm and collected, so your words come out strong and sure, not fast and jumbled.\nAlso, don't forget to smile. A smile lights up your face and shows you're enjoying yourself.\n3. Be able to take care of yourself.: Many old guys will be turned off if you are just looking for someone to take care of you. In other words, have a steady job and a well-established house or apartment. If an older guy is looking at you, those qualities will show him your mature enough to date him.\n4. Keep your cool.: You may think it's best to spill your whole life story on the first date. Really, though, that shows a lack of maturity. Keep some things back for later in your dating life.\nCuriosity is attractive, so ask questions about his life and passions to make him feel important.\n5. Show you're committed to relationships.: That is, be on good terms with your family. By being on good terms, you've shown that you can maintain long-term relationships, even when things may get a little tough.\n6. Act mature.: Depending on how old the guy is, he may have completely different social habits than you. If you're in your 20s, and you're after a guy in his 30s, he may not be as interested in going out drinking as you are.\nYou don't have to change who you are to attract an older guy, but you should make sure the two of you are a good fit. An older guy is likely to be more set in his ways, but that doesn't mean you have to follow suit. You can still go out with your friends, but don't leave a string of drunken messages on his phone.\n7. Avoid pointing out the age gap.: Getting over the age gap may be one of the harder aspects of dating an older guy. Avoid making references about his age, and if you bring your friends around, make sure they do the same.\nAn age gap between partners can make it harder to connect. He probably has different hobbies, and different tastes, than you do. Try to connect with him on these things. Listen to music he likes, but also try to expose him to things you like. Don't force him to behave like a younger man, but try to involve him in your hobbies and interests.\n8. Don't play games.: It doesn't matter how old someone is, nobody likes manipulation. Don't try to make an older man jealous to get his attention, and don't play head games to make him want you.\n\nOne reason an older man might hesitate to date a younger woman is the fear of being toyed with. Approach an older guy with confidence and be direct. If you like him, say so.\n\nDon't assume that because a man is older, he's mature and ready to settle down. Some older men may want to take advantage of younger women to make themselves feel younger. Just as you don't want to play games with an older man, don't let an older man play games with you.\n9. Treat him with respect.: Don't go after an older man because you want his money. He may be successful, and he may spoil you with the occasional nice date, but that doesn't mean he's going to give you all his money.\nDon't ask him how much money he makes, or what kind of car he drives. If he gets the feeling that you're only with him for his money, he's likely to end things. If you don't actually like the guy, don't lead him on.\n10. Talk about your goals in life.: Before you get into a relationship with an older guy, find out what his goals are. Does he have any long-term plans? It's important to know how you will fit into each other's life.\n\nIf he already has kids, for example, he may not be interested in starting a whole new family with you. If you don't want kids, this may be fine with you. But, if you do want kids, this could mean trouble down the road.\nDon't sacrifice your own goals to be with someone who is already starting to settle down. Or, if his plans are to start traveling the world, and you're still finishing up college, don't drop everything just to be with him.\n11. Maintain intimacy.: Intimacy is a big part of any relationship. Don't base your entire relationship on sexual compatibility, but take it into consideration.\nDon't assume that an older man will be less sexually active. The opposite is more likely to be true. An older man has probably had more sexual partners, and is likely to have more experience in the bedroom.\n12. Have fun together.: More than anything, make sure you can get along with each other. Learn from each other and delight in sharing new experiences with one another.\nTake some time to assess your compatibility. Find out if you have any overlapping hobbies and pursue those. Find ways to spend time doing things you both enjoy.\n13. Introduce him into your social circle.: One big hurdle of dating an older guy is wondering how he will fit in with the rest of your friends. Think about the type of people you regularly hang out with. How will they react to you dating an older man?\n\nYour friends shouldn't dictate who you date, especially if you care for the person. However, you should consider how your partner will get along with your friends. Likewise, think about who he hangs out with, and how you feel about his friends.\nTalk with each other about your respective social circles. Make sure your partner is comfortable with your friends, and vice versa.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The conversation was described as straightforward, polite and cordial, with the president calling to exchange pleasantries and offer his congratulations on waging the campaign.\nThe call came two days after Trump took to Twitter to urge West Virginia Republicans to reject Blankenship’s candidacy. In the tweet, Trump argued that Blankenship, who spent a year in jail following a 2010 explosion at his Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 workers, would be unable to defeat Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November.\nBlankenship would go on to lose the primary decisively, finishing a distant third behind state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins.\nIn his remarks to supporters on Tuesday evening, Blankenship attributed his loss to the president’s last-minute intervention in the contest, saying that it had halted his momentum.\nIn the final hours of the race, he said he was convinced that Trump had been pushed into the intervention by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had aggressively opposed Blankenship.\nThe president also connected briefly with Jenkins, but as of Wednesday evening had yet to connect with Morrisey, the winner of the primary. On Tuesday, though, Morrisey spoke with Donald Trump Jr. During the call, the president’s eldest son promised to be helpful.\nTrump’s calls on Wednesday, several Republicans said, were partly aimed at healing the wounds following a deeply divisive primary. Blankenship has yet to endorse Morrisey, who aggressively attacked him during the final days of the race.\nSome in the party are concerned that the deep-pocketed Blankenship, who spent more than $2.5 million of his own funds in the primary, could wage an effort to damage Morrisey in the general election.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,\" Margrethe Vestager, the EU's commissioner for competition, said in a statement.\n\"In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU state aid rules. Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,\" she added.\nFrom June 2014, Amazon changed the way it operates in Europe and the new structure is outside the EU Commission's authority on state aid.\nIn the period investigated, Amazon was shifting its profits from a company that was subject to tax in Luxembourg to another one that wasn't subject to tax, known as the \"holding company.\" The latter had no employees, no offices and no business activities.\nLuxembourg is due to receive the amount created by the aid, though there are no fines under EU law. Luxembourg authorities said they have taken notice of the decision and will \"use appropriate due diligence to analyze the decision.\"\nEU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager addresses a press conference on two state aid cases at the European Commission in Brussels on October 4, 2017.\n\"The decision of the Commission refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved,\" they said.\nAmazon said in response to the commission's decision that it believes it did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that it paid tax in \"full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\"\n\"We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us,\" the online retailing giant said in a statement.\nThe European Commission opened its investigation into Amazon and Luxembourg's tax arrangements in October 2014.\nLuxembourg and U.S. technology companies have been at the center of the commission's probes into tax affairs and antitrust. Last year, the EU ordered Ireland to recover 13 billion euros in taxes from Apple. The commission is also looking into the tax deal between McDonald's and Luxembourg.\nThe EU has promised to scrutinize tax arrangements between large mulitnationals and the bloc's member states. This case is likely to increase tensions between Europe and the U.S. After the commission's decision on Apple, Chief Executive Tim Cook denounced it as \"total political crap.\" The Amazon tax ruling is also set against a push by President Donald Trump to come up with a money repatriation plan for U.S. companies with big cash piles abroad.\nAt the heart of the EU's investigation into Amazon is its network of subsidiaries in Europe and so-called transfer pricing. That is the price of goods that one subsidiary of a company sells to another subsidiary under the same corporation. This in itself is not illegal. But what is illegal is if this transfer of goods is mispriced, therefore affecting the profits a company makes, and subsequently how much tax it pays.\nIn 2004, Amazon restructured its operations to create Amazon EU Sarl, which was its European operating headquarters. Amazon EU Sarl pays a royalty to the parent company in Europe for use of intellectual property. But that parent company is a limited liability partnership, which is not subject to corporate tax in Luxembourg.\nThe Amazon ruling could be embarrassing for Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, who was Luxembourg's prime minister from 1995 to 2013.\nAt the opening of these investigations, many European policymakers asked for Juncker's resignation. However, he denied any involvement in the tax arrangements, saying that the prime minister doesn't have enough power to restrict the work of tax authorities.\nCorrection: This story has been revised to correct the amount in U.S. dollars that Amazon has been ordered to pay.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What does it mean to be a creative person?", "output": "Today, we see a hybrid creature who is both an artist and a businessperson. He or she is just as comfortable in a corporate meeting room as they are in an art studio. They wield either pen or paintbrush with equal skill. This person is a creative entrepreneur.\nMore and more businesses are making the adaptations necessary to attract and retain creative class employees - everything from relaxed dress codes, flexible schedules, and new work rules in the office to hiring recruiters who throw Frisbees.\nWhat it means to be a creative person.\nCreative entrepreneurs are now finding willing listeners to their ideas. And in the information age, the creative entrepreneur’s killer combo of art skill with business savvy can quickly become their unfair advantage.\nBut what do we mean by unfair advantage? It’s the ‘edge’ that creative people have.\nThe creative mind works overtime to process information, assess the big picture of a situation, and synthesise different ideas. This happens subconsciously and so it’s happening all the time: while on a walk, while driving, while in the shower, even while sleeping.\nFor the creative person, this is totally natural, and so it doesn’t feel like work. In fact, it often feels a lot more like play. The creative mind does not obey a “9 to 5” schedule – it’s always working.\nIf more creative people realised something about themselves that their bosses already know, they’d ask for a lot more money. The thing is: even with modest resources and time, a creative worker can produce many times more value than the original investment.\nPicture this: you’re in a museum in say, London – amidst the vast collection of artifacts from every age and location on earth. But something catches your eye. There’s a rumpled piece of paper with hasty words scrawled on it, some lines of text are crossed out and others squeezed haphazardly. Nothing artistically relevant or inherently valuable. Its immense value is in the words represented. Let’s say that the idea conveyed by these scribbled symbols was a song – and that song was Yesterday by the Beatles.\nPaul McCartney (Lennon is also credited) wrote that song in 1964-65. The value of a crumpled scrap of paper from the 1960s: practically zero. The value of that song today? According to the BBC, in 2012 it has amassed royalties of 19.5 million pounds, making it the fourth most successful song of all time in terms of royalties.\nIn our information rich society, the creative’s ability to synthesise different bits of data into a relevant (and attractive) whole that can be consumed is an increasingly prized skill to have. This is called curation.\nArtists normally enjoy making things. As employees, as long as we’re given clear direction and enough autonomy to work, as well as the necessary tools that we need to do our job, we are highly effective and require minimum direction. This makes us extremely valuable to any company.\nMarketing is a frequently misunderstood field. Many people think it’s all about hype and overselling. But just because some marketing-types act this way, it doesn’t mean all marketing (or truly effective marketing) is this way. The core effectiveness of good marketing is simply communication. It’s telling the story of a brand in an attractive way that (ideally) is authentic enough to portray it’s values accurately. This matches customers with companies in a harmonious relationship.\nIf there is a flaw in a business, or something that could be tweaked to work better, a creative person will usually find it and give you a lot of suggestions on how to fix it.\nCreatives may not be extroverted party animals, but they’re certainly interesting to be around. They seem to have a photographic memory for all things offbeat and wacky, they can carry a discussion about philosophy in one sentence and obscure pop-culture the next.\nNon-creative people are culture chasers. Creative people are culture makers. Creatives understand people and think deeply about what makes them tick. They “get” offbeat humor. They understand symbolism and can create products that are rich with significance and meaning for any audience.\nVision, in the entrepreneurial sense, is the ability to form a mental image of something that hasn’t happened or been created yet. Creatives with extensive experience and the ability to communicate their vision become thought leaders. These thought leaders are highly sought after for their opinions, and they have considerable influence over companies and cultures.\nPut simply, creatives know how to make stuff look, sound, and feel “right”.\nHowever, the good news is that creativity isn't scarce and it does not belong to a select few.

That rule does not apply when they reach Mexico.\nThe local offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Tuesday evening they were worried about the safety of migrants in the caravan, noting the group included women, children and senior citizens.\nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his annoyance at the caravan, which follows a similar event in May that ultimately led to hundreds of migrants either seeking asylum in the United States or remaining in Mexico.\n“The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!” Trump wrote.\nTrump expanded his threat in a later tweet to include Guatemala and El Salvador.\n“We have today informed the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens, or others, to journey through their borders and up to the United States, with the intention of entering our country illegally, all payments made to them will STOP (END)!” he said.\nThe strong words could encourage Honduras to move closer to China amid intensified efforts by Beijing to win recognition from Central American countries aligned with Taiwan.\nHonduras is one of a dwindling number of countries that still have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, an island nation off the Chinese coast that Beijing views as a renegade province.\nPence told Central American countries last week the United States was willing to help with economic development and investment if they did more to tackle mass migration, corruption and gang violence.\nThe migrants in the group making its way north plan to seek refugee status in Mexico or pass through to the United States, saying they are fleeing poverty and violence.\nWidespread violence and poverty prompt thousands of Central Americans, mainly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, to make the arduous journey north toward Mexico and the United States in search of a better life.\nTrump ran for president in 2016 on promises to toughen U.S. immigration policies and build a wall along the 2,000-mile(3,220-km) border with Mexico.\nIllegal immigration is likely to be a top issue in Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, when Democrats are seen as having a good chance of gaining control of the House of Representatives from Trump’s fellow Republicans.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Hey, what do you know about gene editing?", "output": "A team of researchers, including UConn assistant professor of pharmaceutics Raman Bahal, has, for the first time, corrected a genetic mutation in a mammalian fetus using a targeted gene editing technique. The approach offers a potential new pathway for treating inherited genetic disorders during the earliest stages of development.\nEvery year, an estimated 8 million children are born with severe genetic disorders or birth defects. While genetic conditions can be detected during pregnancy using amniocentesis, there are no treatment options currently to correct the conditions before birth.\nYet in a paper appearing in the international science journal Nature Communications, scientists from UConn, Yale University, and Carnegie Mellon University describe how they corrected a genetic mutation in fetal mice using an intravenous injection of nanoparticles loaded with a combination of donor DNA and synthetic molecules known as peptide nucleic acids or PNAs.\nWhile the results are encouraging, the researchers caution that much more research needs to be done before the application can even be considered for human trials.\n“This study provides a benchmark for gene editing technology where diseases can be treated at a very early stage of development,” says Bahal, a recent arrival to UConn who performed the research when he was an associate scientist working in the Yale lab of Dr. Peter Glazer, a professor of therapeutic radiology and genetics.\nIn the current study, the researchers injected the nanoparticle suspension into the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice whose fetuses carried a genetic mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin and causes a severe form of anemia. The nanoparticles deliver the PNA/DNA complex to the site of the mutation, where the PNA molecule, which mimics DNA, binds to the faulty gene’s DNA, creating a triple helix. This helical distortion activates the mutated cell’s repair response, which corrects the mutation using the healthy donor DNA packaged with the PNA.\nFour months after birth, the treated mice showed dramatic improvements in symptoms of beta thalassemia, enough so for them to be considered cured. Mice that received a single injection of the PNA/DNA complex in utero had normal blood counts, spleens of normal size, and lived a normal life span. Untreated mice with the genetic disorder died much earlier, the researchers found.\nMost importantly, the researchers say, the chemically-oriented process resulted in no off-target effects from treatment, which has been a major concern for other gene editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9, which can erroneously damage untargeted DNA and cause complications. Such collateral damage has limited CRISPR/Cas9’s therapeutic applications, they say.\nThe fetal research study was patterned after an earlier successful trial of the gene editing process in anemic adult mice. Bahal served as the lead author of the adult mice study, which was reported in Nature Communications in 2016. For both studies, Bahal designed and synthesized the next generation gamma PNAs used in the treatment. These modified PNAs exhibit enhanced binding to DNA, which provides better capacity for gene editing.\nWorking with diseased fetal tissue presented an enormous challenge for the researchers. The latest effort was a true collaborative process, Bahal says. The PNA molecules were synthesized in Glazer’s lab and the nanoparticles were formulated in the lab of W. Mark Saltzman, Yale University’s Goizueta Foundation Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Chemical & Environmental Engineering, & Physiology.\nProfessor Danith Ly of Carnegie Mellon University provided material for the gamma PNA molecules, and the team relied on the expertise of Yale pediatric surgeon Dr. David H. Stitelman in making the necessary fetal injections.\nTreating the disorder at the fetal stage allowed the researchers to target important stem cells, which propagate the corrected DNA once they are treated, rather than DNA carrying the mutation.\nMoving forward, the researchers plan to test the approach on other genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and Hurler disease.\nBahal says a recent grant he received from Cooley’s Anemia Foundation will be critical in allowing him to build resources in his new UConn lab to take the gene editing technology to the next level.\nBeta thalassemia is caused by more than 200 different genetic point mutations. The successful results reported in the recent study only addressed those related to a beta globin gene mutation in individuals of Asian heritage, which was selected for the study, says Bahal.\nThe research was funded by the Brain Research Foundation Scientific Innovations Award, the NIGMS Medical Scientist Training Program (GM07205), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (HL134252), the Ohse Research Grant, Yale School of Medicine, the American Pediatric Surgical Association Foundation Grant, and the DSF Charitable Foundation.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Respond in 18 sentences.", "output": "London: The UK high court has ordered Vijay Mallya to pay a minimum of £200,000 towards the costs incurred by 13 Indian banks in their legal battle to recover alleged dues. Last month, Judge Andrew Henshaw had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya’s assets and upheld an Indian court’s ruling that a consortium of 13 Indian banks, led by State Bank of India (SBI), were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly £1.145 billion.\nAs part of the judgment, the court has also ordered Mallya, 62, to pay costs towards registration of the worldwide freezing order and of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) of Karnataka’s judgment in Britain.\n“The court ordered that Mallya pay the banks’ costs. The standard order is that the court will assess those costs unless the parties can otherwise agree a figure for what should be paid,\" said a legal expert familiar with the case.\nThe court’s assessment of costs is a separate process, which ends with another court hearing before a specialist costs judge in the UK. But, in the meantime, Mallya must pay £200,000 towards this legal costs liability.\nIn a high court ruling dated 8 May, judge Henshaw had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya’s assets and upheld an Indian court’s ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks—State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu and Kashmir Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd—were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly £1.145 billion.\n“The First Defendant’s (Mallya) application for permission to appeal is refused. Any further application for permission to appeal should be made to the Court of Appeal to be dealt with by a judge of that court,\" the judgment noted.\nMallya, who is separately also fighting extradition to India on fraud and money laundering charges worth an estimated ₹ 9,000 crore, has since filed an appeal notice at the Court of Appeal, which includes an application for permission to appeal. Permission will only be granted if the court considers that the appeal would have a real prospect of success or there is some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard.\nMeanwhile, Mallya is due back at Westminster Magistrates Court in London next month for one of the final hearings in his extradition case. A hearing for closing arguments to be presented by his defence team and the Crown Prosecution Service, on behalf of the Indian authorities, was scheduled for 11 July but is now likely to take place on 31 July.\nThe former boss of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April last year.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service believes it has successfully established a prima facie case of fraud against the businessman and that there are no bars to his extradition to face the courts in India. Mallya’s lawyers have claimed the criminal charges against their client are “without substance\" and “politically motivated\". They have also challenged the case on human rights grounds, questioning the conditions at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where the businessman is to be held post-extradition.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "How was the culprit(s) who vandalized the Confederate statue in Rockville, MD never identified?", "output": "Rockville Nights: Rockville rejects Confederate statue - now what?\nThis is an asinine response to current race-related events. Relocating or warehousing this statue will have NO effect whatsoever on race relations. This is simply a political maneuver and is misdirecting anger and frustration into the most glamorous yet least productive solution. People need to be examining the underlying issues, doing some soul searching and coming together to find ways to solve them instead of laying all the blame on history. Perhaps our city and county can form some kind of public-private community task force on this issue (which is not going to go away on its own or by frivolously erasing a Confederate reference).\nThe impact of this statue on the image of our city has not been just a recent event. For years members of the indigenous black community , and many in the white community, have opposed this statues presence. As a native of Rockville, and I will assume 9:55 AM is not, applaud the actions of the council in finally rejecting this monument to a dark period in the city's history.\nRobert, Who said, \"It will be a major embarrassment for the County if it is forced to mothball the statue in a warehouse someplace.\" Was that your comment or the remark of a Rockville official? Thanks.\n3:28: It was my comment.\n12:02pm, you are correct that I (9:55am) am not a native of the area and do not know of past issues with the statue. However, I still feel that this move does nothing to actually solve any problems, unless of course it is followed up with serious dialogue and effort to repair race relations. Otherwise, it is just a token action, albeit a very expensive token and nothing more. It merely emboldens the vandals who defaced it (who by the way will then move on to their next act).\nI believe in preserving history in its various forms. To not do so is an insult to those who came before us. I come from a country which was the victim of colonialism yet I do NOT advocate tearing down references and symbols of the colonizing country. Why? Because the past is the past and these symbols serve to remind us of what our country and its people at the time went through. Sure my people were oppressed at one time but that time is long gone. The question before us is what can we do on our own to improve our situation today. History may have given us some disadvantages but we are still empowered human beings in a country that provides no shortage of opportunity to succeed.\nThe Confederate statue is there to commemorate those who died fighting on that side. To make it equitable, such a symbol actually could be constructed for the Union side as well (maybe a win-win solution) but is not necessarily needed because the Union won! Our country, system of government, laws and we the people are living reminders of this fact. I can certainly empathize with those who feel hurt by that statue but the fact is it represents history. That statue is not a living breathing entity still wielding oppressive power today. Let's not give it more importance that what it deserves. While a bit corny, there is actually something to be learned in the phrase \"sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me\".\nTo add one more thing, these are my views only. Robert has nothing to do with them, he is doing a great job reporting the news in a factual light.\nOne thing that mystifies me - how was the culprit(s) who vandalized the statue never identified. The number of police vehicles in town center is the highest in the County - City, County, Sheriff, and sometimes State Police cruisers all over the place. There must have been innumerable surveillance cameras on government buildings and at nearby businesses the perpetrators would have been caught on. How can it still be unsolved?\nRobert, Did you do this joke photo? It's very humorous. Can you post it?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Describe the opposition to Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.", "output": "More Americans oppose the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court than that of any other nominee in recent history, according to a poll from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\nThe survey, taken a week after President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh, found Americans deeply divided along partisan lines. While 41 percent of adults surveyed supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation, 36 percent opposed it, the highest unfavorability ranking in data going back to 2005, when President George W. Bush picked John Roberts for chief justice.\nOpposition to Kavanaugh is even greater than that against Harriet Miers, the Bush nominee who, amid withering criticism from her own party, withdrew from the running less than a month after being nominated. And the partisan gap over Kavanaugh’s nomination is about twice as wide as it was for Roberts, the Pew survey found. Republicans and Republican-leaning adults were 57 percentage points more likely than Democrats to say the Senate should confirm Kavanaugh.\nDemocrats’ worry about the court’s direction is higher today than it was in November 2005, when Bush nominated Samuel Alito to replace Sandra Day O’Connor. At the time, 38 percent of Democrats worried that Alito would shift the court too far right, compared with 53 percent of Democrats reacting to Kavanaugh today. The poll, conducted July 11-15 by telephone with 1,007 people nationwide, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\nThe data underscore the tough fight that Kavanaugh, who has served on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia since 2006, faces in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he wants the nominee confirmed by the beginning of the court’s next term, Oct. 1. Kavanaugh’s fate could hinge on the votes of four Democrats in conservative states, three of whom are up for reelection this year.\nKavanaugh’s paper trail — from his judicial decisions, as well as two years in the White House counsel’s office under Bush, more than three as Bush’s staff secretary and as a prosecutor for Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr — could amount to hundreds of pages, and both sides are preparing for high-dollar grass-roots and messaging campaigns.\nThe conservative Judicial Crisis Network has spent $3.8 million on ads targeting Democratic senators in conservative states.

{"input": "\"What does it mean to be a Reader in the Orthodox Church?\"", "output": "Question: \"How does one become a Reader, and what does a Reader do?\"\n\"My son, the first degree in the Priesthood is that of Reader. It behooveth thee therefore to peruse the divine Scriptures daily, to the end that the hearers, regarding thee may receive edification; that thou in nowise shaming thine election, mayest prepare thyself for a higher degree. For by a chaste, holy and upright life thou shalt gain the favor of the God of loving-kindness, and shalt render thyself worthy of a greater ministry, through Jesus Christ our Lord: to whom be glory unto the ages of ages. Amen.\"\nThis tells us that the office of the Reader is the first rank of the priesthood. There are two types of clergy: minor clergy, and major clergy. Readers are tonsured, which means that rather than being ordained in the Altar, they are set apart by having some of their hair cut in the form of the Cross (as also happens at baptism, and when someone is made a monastic) and ordained in the Nave of the Church, as are Subdeacons, who are also minor clergy. The major clergy are Bishops, Priest, and Deacons.\nBut what it means for this to be the first rank of the priesthood is that the same basic requirements to be ordained a Priest are also required of a Reader. A reader must of course be Orthodox. He must also be a man who has not been married more than once. He must be of a good reputation. There are other possible impediments to ordination, and most of them apply equally to readers (there are different age requirements for deacons, priests, and bishops, and bishops are required to be monastics).\nA Reader should also read the Scriptures daily, and be familiar enough with the texts that he reads that those who hear him are able to understand him, and be edified by his reading. In addition to that, a Reader should learn the rubrics of the services, and should learn to sing his way through the services by learning the tones, and how to use and combine the liturgical texts at the kliros. In most parishes, there are choir directors who do most of that work at the main services, but a Reader should learn this as well, so that if he is the only person at the kliros (as can happen at some of the daily services) he will be able to read and sing all of the parts of the services that are not specific to the Bishop, Priest, and Deacon.\nThe admonition to the Reader that he \"in nowise\" shame his election means that he should be an example to others in the Church. As St. Paul admonished St. Timothy: \"be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\" (1 Timothy 4:12). And a reader should do this in order to prepare himself \"for a higher degree.\" In other words, a reader should be preparing himself for the possibility of serving in a higher rank of the clergy. Of course all Christians should try to be an example \"in word, in conduct, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity,\" but this should be especially the case for clergy. This means a Reader should be personally pious, loving towards others, and should love the services of the Church.\nAnyone who is able (and of course an Orthodox Christian) can serve the function of a Reader, when needed. And there are many people who are not tonsured as Readers who do. However, one who actually is a Reader has a duty to fill this role, and so should be zealous to prepare himself to fulfill this role, and should be eager to actually do it, being present whenever possible for the services, and making themselves available to do their duty.\nIf someone is interested in becoming a reader, they should speak to the priest and begin applying themselves to learning how to properly do it. Even if they are not eventually tonsured as a Reader, the knowledge they acquire is beneficial to any Orthodox Christian.\nFor more on what it means to be a Reader, I would recommend reading Instruction for the Church Reader as well as A Guide for Readers in the Orthodox Church, by Fr. Geoffrey Korz.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Leveraging Angular 2 with NativeScript to Require Fields", "output": "The following is a guest blog post by Nick Branstein, co-author of the upcoming NativeScript in Action book. The first nine chapters of the book are already available, and if you purchase today with the code nstelerik you’ll get 50% off.\nI’ve been dabbling in NativeScript since the early beta days in 2015 so needless to say I’ve been following NativeScript for quite some time now and I love the ease as to which it helps me create iOS and Android apps. Last year at ng-conf, the NativeScript team made a big splash by announcing the integration of Angular and NativeScript. Secretly, I had been looking for an excuse to learn Angular and this marriage of the two frameworks gave me that excuse. In this post we’re going to talk about the integration of a feature from Angular into a NativeScript with Angular app. I’ll assume that you’ve already completed a basic NativeScript and Angular app. If you aren’t familiar with Angular and how it integrates with NativeScript it’s pretty quick to pick up so head on over to the tutorial and meet me back here when you are done!\nOne of the things that I find myself doing a lot in apps (mobile and web) is collecting input and data from the user. In a web app, you have a form element that you can use to capture multiple data points from a user. Angular comes with a lot of features out of the box that work directly with the form control of a web app such as data binding, validation, and error handling. You can learn more about Angular forms and features right here.\nIn a NativeScript app, there is no native form element like there is for the web. If you are building a NativeScript app with Angular, you can still take full advantage the features that Angular provides for forms. Let’s take a look and see how we can port this functionality over to a NativeScript with Angular app.\nWhen using two-way databinding in your app (done by importing NativeScriptFormsModule into your AppModule), Angular automatically tracks the state of controls by applying the following classes to each element: ng-touched, ng-untouched, ng-dirty, ng-pristine, ng-valid, and ng-invalid (for more information you can review these classes in the official Angular documentation).\nAs you can see, Angular will apply the appropriate classes to NativeScript components the same way it works with forms in a web page. One important note is that Angular is tracking the valid/invalid state of the native TextField because we added the required property to it; even though required is not a property that NativeScript exposes, Angular is still able to read it.\nIf we modify the example slightly and get a reference to the backing model of the TextField, then we are able to also read the valid property model that Angular is tracking for us to quickly determine if the TextField is populated or not.\nSince we know we can leverage Angular 2 in our NativeScript app to keep track of fields we want to require let’s finish porting the Angular 2 examples over to a NativeScript app. First, we can apply styling to our TextField based on the classes Angular 2 is creating.\nNext, we can show/hide a save button on our page if the field is invalid.\nIn this post we’ve discussed how to require fields using Angular forms. You can get the full code for this example on GitHub.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What are some tips to make your own pore strips at home?", "output": "1. Before applying a pore strip, you should always wash your face. This will remove dirt and oil. The warmth will also open up your pores, making the strips more effective.\nIt is important that you are not wearing any makeup when you apply the pore strips.\n2. You should use equal parts milk and gelatin. Approximately a tablespoon of each should work, but you might find that you can use less than this.\n\nAny type of milk should work. You can use whole, skim, almond, or soy milk.\nThe gelatin should be unflavored, so as to avoid introducing extraneous substances into the pore strip.\nSome people recommend adding a drop of lavender essential oil to the mixture.\n3. Use a utensil, possibly the brush you will use later, to mix the milk and gelatin together. By the time that you are done, it should have a thick, chunky, cloudy appearance.\n4. You will need the mixture to be warm, but not hot. You can either microwave it or heat it on the stove. If you microwave it, be sure to do so in a microwave safe container.\n\nIf microwaving, heat the mixture for 10 seconds.\nIf using the stove, place in a small container. Heat slowly, mixing as it heats. This method will allow you to better monitor the temperature. Stop when the mixture is warm, but not hot.\n5. If you used the microwave, remove the container from the microwave. Allow it to cool for 20 seconds. It should look even cloudier than before.\n6. Use the brush to test the temperature on your hand. It should be warm, but not hot. Put a small amount of the mixture on the brush and see how it feels on your hand.\n7. Use a makeup brush or your fingers to spread the mixture across your face. Be sure to target areas in which you have had outbreaks in the past.\nIf you use a makeup brush, clean it off thoroughly before using it again.\n8. As the mixture cools it should solidify and form a mask. This could take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. The longer you wait, the more likely it is that the mixture will attach to the dirt in your pores. This will allow you to better pull out the dirt. Therefore, it is best to error on the side of leaving the mixture on for a longer period of time.\n9. Start from the outside and peel the hardened mixture off your face. Progress slowly. If you try to rip the whole mask off at once, you might hurt yourself.\n10. After removing the strip, rinse your face with cold water to remove any additional pieces of the mixture from your face. The cold water will also close your pores. Afterward, apply moisturizer.\n11. You should always wash your face before using a pore strip. Washing removes dirt and oil. Using warm water will also open up your pores. \n\nIt is particularly important to remove makeup before applying the pore strips.\n\nBy opening up your pores, warm water will make it easier for the pore strip to attach to dirt inside the pores. Thus you can pull it out and prevent blackheads from forming.\n12. For these pore strips, you will need the egg white specifically, which can be difficult to separate from the yolk. Consider saving yourself the trouble and purchase egg white that has already been separated.\n\nAlternatively, you can use an egg white separator. Crack the egg and let it run through the separator. The yolk will get caught in the separator and the white will flow through. Have a container underneath to catch the egg white.\nYou can also break the egg into a bowl. Use your hands to gently pick up the yolk and move it to a separate container.\n13. Put egg white in a small bowl and place a large piece of two-ply toilet paper or paper towel in the bowl. It is imperative that the paper be thoroughly soaked in egg white.\nAlternatively, you can use a makeup brush to spread the egg white directly on your face, stick the paper on your face, and then use the paper to apply an additional layer of egg white on top.\n14. A large piece of paper can be spread across your entire face, or at least most of it. This will allow you to get a lot of blackheads at the same time. Be especially careful to target problem areas, where you have or are experiencing blackheads.\n15. The paper should harden, so that it sticks to your face. This might take anywhere from 10-20 minutes.\nThere is no need to tear the paper up into thin sheets, like store bought pore strips. You can use one large paper towel or piece of toilet paper to cover much of your face. This makes the process quicker and easier.\n16. After approximately 10-20 minutes, slowly remove the paper from your face. Start from the edge when peeling it off. Do not pull it off so quickly that you hurt yourself.\n17. After removing the strip, rinse your face with cold water. It is possible that small pieces of the pore strip will stick to your face if you do not wash. After you wash, apply moisturizer to your face.\nYou should use cold water when washing after removing the pore strip. Cold water will close your pores.\n18. Before you commit yourself to one type of pore strip, try them to see which is most effective. If you are having difficulty with a specific type of pore strip, try altering the way that you use or apply it.\n\nSome people report that paper towels are much more effective than toilet paper when making an egg white pore strips.\n\nTo tell if your pore strip is working, look at it afterward to see if pieces of dirt and grime have been picked up. If so, the strip is working.\nIt is also a good sign if the strip seems to stick well to your skin. If it is hard to remove, then it is working well.\n19. The egg white solution might remove blackheads, but can also cause pimples. Sometimes this is temporary. However, if this is a reoccurring problem, consider a different method.\n20. You can reserve this treatment for when a blackhead appears. But to ensure that blackheads are a thing of the past for you, try this treatment every 1-2 weeks. This will keep your pores clean and forestall the appearance of blackheads.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Hardly a day passes in which there is no negative article about the social media website that is luring away “our” readers and advertisers.\nThere was the blocking of the image of a girl fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam. It generated outrage from, among others, Norway’s prime minister Erna Solberg in the Guardian, Jane Fae in the Daily Telegraph and Dominic Lawson in the Sunday Times (an excellent piece).\nFacebook’s tax affairs have come under the microscope. Questions were raised about Facebook’s attack on ad-blocking software (as if that isn’t in the interest of every news outlet). And there have been plenty of critical articles about Facebook’s news feeds, notably its “trending topics” feature.\nIt is argued that this narrows users’ news agenda by advising (or “telling”) them what to read. Evidently, people are bound to follow the herd. According to a Pew Research Center study released in May, 66% of Facebook users get news through the site.\nThese choices are made by algorithms, which can monitor users’ interests and then “feed” them what it believes they wish to read while filtering out material they are supposed not to want. This system therefore creates an “echo chamber” or “filter bubble” effect.\nAlthough I nodded in agreement I couldn’t help but remind myself that it conveniently overlooked the fact that before the arrival of the internet news in newspapers was what newspapers said it was.\nIt has always been the case from the dawn of media that the controllers of news outlets - newspapers, TV and radio, online - make choices about what to publish and, more significantly, what not to publish. So is there a real need to be especially concerned about Facebook?\nBy contrast, even the most advanced and successful of newspaper websites are unable to do the same. They can’t compete, she writes, with such sophisticated targeting. Hence the difficulty all are facing in trying to secure enough digital ad revenue to fund their journalism.\nKiss doesn’t develop this single point explicitly. But I will. Facebook’s increasing dominance over advertising is causing the laying off of journalists, the people who produce the news that it transmits to its users.\nThe logical conclusion to that process is not only the destruction of old media, legacy media, mainstream media, whatever you want to call it, but the end of journalism as we know it.\nBefore cynics shout about that not being a bad thing (while digital optimists assert that independent, and therefore better, journalism will arise in its place), think of the perils we face without a collective of organised, skilled journalists working for organisations large enough to hold power to account.\nThe Facebookisation of news has the potential to destabilise democracy by, first, controlling what we read and, second, by destroying the outlets that provide that material.\nKiss cites a Pew Research Center study which found that Facebook is far and away the most popular site for sharing news in the United States.\nTurning to the controversy over the control exercised over news choices, she points out that although human editors have been replaced by algorithms, those “robots” are, of course, designed by humans. So decisions on what appears and doesn’t appear is neither neutral nor impartial.\nAnd she is surely on strong ground in questioning the lack of transparency involved in the decisions Facebook makes in creating, and continually tweaking, its algorithms.\nI could not agree more. That’s the mission imperilled by Facebook.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Changes to the admission process of NYC specialized high schools, specifically proposals to stop admitting students based on a single test and to base admissions on a combination of a student’s class rank and scores on state standardized tests.", "output": "But the politics around the issue have changed, and with his re-election behind him, Mr. de Blasio this weekend showed his willingness to take on some of the most fiercely guarded schools in the system, proposing that the city’s specialized high schools stop admitting students based on a single test.\nThere are eight specialized schools that admit students based on their performance on a test. While the number of students they serve is relatively small, they take on outsize importance because they are among the most prestigious schools in the city — like Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science — and because their demographics deviate so starkly from the system over all.\nBlack and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city’s public school students, but they received just 10 percent of offers for seats at specialized schools this fall. Both white and Asian students, on the other hand, are overrepresented. About 27 percent of the offers went to white students, who make up 15 percent of the school system; 52 percent went to Asian students, who make up 16 percent.\nMr. de Blasio’s plan has two parts. The first, which the city can do on its own, would set aside 20 percent of seats at each of the eight specialized schools for poor students who just miss the cutoff score on the test. Those students would be pulled from high-poverty schools, which tend to have a higher concentration of black or Hispanic students. They would be eligible to earn their seat by completing the city’s summer Discovery program.\nThe city has estimated modest gains from these changes, which will begin going into effect for the September 2019 admissions cycle. Officials expect the percentage of black and Latino students at those schools to rise to about 16 percent of seats from 9 percent.\nThe more substantial proposal calls for eliminating the test entirely and instead basing admissions on a combination of a student’s class rank and scores on state standardized tests, taking the top 7 percent of students from each of the city’s middle schools. The Education Department said that about 7 percent of specialized seats would be set aside for students from nonpublic schools, like private schools or Catholic schools. High performers from those schools would be chosen by lottery.\nThat change would require action in Albany because a state law requires that specialized high schools in New York City use a standardized exam to determine admissions. Mr. de Blasio said he would press the Legislature to adopt these changes, and a bill to put them into effect was introduced in the Assembly on Friday. But the Senate has been extremely resistant to eliminating the test, and Sunday’s news conference was replete with references to how difficult the road ahead there would be. Democrats are hoping to flip the chamber in November, which would improve the bill’s chances.\nStill, given the limited scope of the Discovery program, Mr. de Blasio’s proposal is heavily dependent on legislative action in Albany, and some advocates consider the proposal to be quite modest. Many legal experts have said the city could immediately reclassify five of the eight specialized schools, allowing Mr. de Blasio to change their admissions criteria without the Legislature. But the mayor said on Sunday that his administration believed that the law is unclear on this point.\nMr. Carranza, the grandson of immigrants from Mexico, has helped to change the tenor of the conversation, speaking about his experience as a “man of color” and segregation in the school system. But Richard Buery, a former deputy mayor in the de Blasio administration who worked on education, said the specialized schools plan had been a long time coming.\nThose plans involved efforts to try to increase access to preparation for the specialized test.\nAlumni from some of the specialized schools have spoken out against doing away with the test, saying the new proposal would introduce subjectivity into what has been an objective and meritocratic process.\nSoo Kim, the president of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association, said that while his organization wants to address the fact that certain groups are underrepresented, he sees the current conversation as extremely problematic.\nMr. de Blasio flatly denied that his plan was “anti-anyone” and said such accusations were an attempt to sow division.\nLarry Cary, president of the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation, said he also has concerns about the plan to set aside 7 percent of seats for students from nonpublic schools, saying it would punish families at those institutions.\nMatt Gonzales, director of the School Diversity Project at New York Appleseed, was underwhelmed by Mr. de Blasio’s moves for very different reasons: While he was pleased at the orientation of the plan, he described the moves as largely symbolic. He said the Discovery changes would help a few more black and Hispanic students, but the mayor’s own numbers show it would hardly be a sea change.

Stéphane Antiga of France has confirmed he's been approached by Volleyball Canada to take over the role.\nAntiga, one of the most decorated players in French national team history, has been at the helm of the Polish national team - leading them to a World Championship in 2014. Canadian fans already have reason to thank the native of Suresnes, France as he led Poland to a 3-0 over Australia in the final match of the Olympic Qualification Tournament - a match that meant nothing to Poland and clinched Canada's spot in the Olympics.\nAntiga is very familiar with Hoag's coaching style - having played for him during his time with the French National team as well at Paris Volley where the pair won the Champions League in 2001.\nWhile the decision and official announcement likely won't come until the new year - Canadian volleyball fans have hope that the program is attracting some of the top coaching talent in the world.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain how modern art has developed over time, with discussion and comparison of specific artworks from the early 20th century.", "output": "Early 20th century modernism often seems to come out of nowhere, especially when our exposure to it comes in the form of a survey of singular great works. Each sculpture, film, or painting can seem sui generis, as though left by an alien civilization for us to find and admire.\nBut when you spend a great deal more time with modern art---looking over artists’ entire body of work and seeing how various schools and individuals developed together---it becomes apparent that all art, even the most radical or strange, evolves in dialogue with art, and that no artist works fully in isolation.\nTake, for example, Monet’s Japanese Footbridge, above, from 1920. It’s a scene from his garden the early impressionist had painted many times over the decades. In this, one of his final paintings of the bridge, we see a riot of reds, oranges, and yellows in gestural brushstrokes that almost obscure the scene entirely. Though we know Monet had failing eyesight due to cataracts, a condition that lead to the vivid colors he saw in this period, it’s hard not to see some homage to Van Gogh, upon whose work Monet’s had a tremendous influence.\nAbove, we have Georgia O’Keeffe’s Lake George, Coat and Red from 1919, which abstracts the vivid patches of color characteristic of Edouard Manet’s work and the fauvism of Henri Matisse, both of whom greatly influenced American modernists like O’Keeffe, Edward Hopper, and Charles Demuth. These paintings reside at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), along with many thousands more that show us the development and interrelationship of modern art in Europe and America. And you can see close to half of them, whether they’re on display or not, at the MoMA’s digital collection.\nThis online collection houses 75,000 works of art in all, to be precise. You can see, for example, Giorgio de Chirico’s The Song of Love, above, a typical painting for the surrealist that shows how much influence he had on the later Salvador Dali, who was only ten years old at the time of this work. At the top of the post, Fernand Leger's Three Women, from 1921, shows the futurist and later pop art French painter in conversation with Picasso and Henri Rousseau.\nIn other instances, we see works that seem anomalous in an artist’s canon, such as Marc Chagall’s 1912 Calvary, above. Known for his depictions of folklore and urban Jewish life, this early work from the same year as The Fiddler (the inspiration for Fiddler on the Roof) shows a much more polished cubist style, and a subject matter that anticipates his “darker” crucifixion series during and after World War II. To begin searching the MoMA’s collection of 75,000 online works, you can begin here with a wide variety of parameters. To browse the collection of early 20th century modernists in which I found these amazing works, start here.\nStrange comments. Modernism out of nowhere? Alien civilization? Lately I have seen lots of evidences that (neo)americans are as far from europeans as eskimos from hotentotes.

Well, here are a load of fun gift ideas that are bound to make your band geek smile. Marching bands aren’t that common here in the UK but I do understand they are a huge part of school life in the USA so here’s some funny gift ideas for those talented musical geeks and nerds out there.\nFirst up is a series of books for band nerds everywhere. Having read a bunch of positive reviews, it seems the author is spot on with his humorous observations and that recipients of these books love them. I’m sure your band nerd would enjoy any one of these books too.\nI love the humor in these t-shirts – the stick figure trumpet player design is available with a violin or piano player (yes, I know piano isn’t exactly band!) too. The rivalry between football and band seems to be a common theme in many band geek designs so these two t-shirts will undoubtedly appeal to band geeks everywhere.\nWhen I saw the Bach t-shirt, I just had to include it even though I have no idea if bands even play any of Bach’s music! The yellow Trombone t-shirt made me smile as it’s a little bit rude but still funny. I did understand the band geek threat #27 though – I’m not totally ignorant of musical stuff after all it seems!\nIf your band geek is a girl then these beautiful necklaces would make a stunning Valentine’s Day gift for her. All three feature a treble clef and are good quality gold rather than costume jewelry. I really like the one with the enameled heart as I like small dainty necklaces but the open design of the heart & treble clef is actually about the same size. Always check product dimensions when buying anything online – the sales photography can be very deceptive!\nLastly we have some slightly random items! I absolutely adore the animal marching band mug and wouldn’t it be a great gift for a younger band geek? The flute band geek tote is also available with a clarinet design and in this age of reusable bags, would make a perfect gift for someone who likes to shop and save the planet at the same time.\nI will own up to being very unmusical. I did take guitar lessons as a kid but I have very little sense of rhythm as well as being seemingly tone deaf! I do love music though and I love to sing – you just don’t want to be around when I do! I greatly admire anyone who has the talent and the dedication to become a musician and band geeks are right up there too. Playing any instrument is hard enough but doing it whilst marching is just another level completely!\nIf you have a geek or a nerd or a gamer to buy gifts for and would like some help finding something special, you can leave a comment below or if you prefer, you could leave a message on our Gifts for Geeks and Gamers Facebook page.

{"input": "Respond in 13 sentences. Describe the potential implications of the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017.", "output": "The measure would give the NSA more power to snoop on digital targets.\nIntelligence officials might not get the permanent surveillance powers they're looking for, but they could get some key concessions all the same. The House Intelligence Committee has passed the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 in a partisan 12-8 vote, clearing it for an eventual vote in the House of Representatives. The bill is ostensibly about renewing the FISA Amendments Act's Section 702 for 4 years, but it also expands the list of eligible spying targets.\nWhere the agency previously only had authority to snoop on either foreign powers or an \"agent of a foreign power,\" it would have the authority to surveil anyone who knowingly helps others who conduct \"international malicious cyber activity.\" That looser definition theoretically lets the NSA collect data on people who are only incidentally connected, rather than those directly involved.\nThere are other issues. This would offer guidance on reviving the sweeping \"about\" collection that scooped up American email en masse, and hints that the NSA could target whole facilities for surveillance, not just specific targets. And when the agency wants to read data caught by widescale surveillance, it would only have the option of seeking a warrant, rather a requirement.\nThere's no guarantee this will survive a House vote or the rest of the Congressional gauntlet, but there's clearly an attempt to rush the measure through the legislature and minimize chances for scrutiny. Both the Committee and the public had less than 2 days to see what it contained before the decision to move forward. And what little debate time there was ended up revolving around protections for \"unmasking\" the identities of Americans, not the broader privacy issues. The NSA could get significantly extended powers with little public discussion.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What is the most efficient way to cook pizza on a barbecue? Could you provide a list of 18 steps?", "output": "1. Confirm that your barbeque has a working thermostat and lid.: Purchase a grill thermometer from a local hardware or big-box store if your grill doesn't have a working thermostat. It should be able to reach and maintain a temperature of around 428 °F (220 °C), which provides enough radiant heat to cook the toppings. If temperatures are too low, you will only be cooking the crust from below.\n\nIf your barbecue doesn't have a lid, you can use an upturned roasting pan instead.\nTry and use a grill with a large, flat hot-plate. Slotted grills can still cook your pizza, but they're much more likely to make a mess.\nFor wood-fired barbecues or fire pits, you need a fixed frame made of bricks and a hot roasting pan filled with hot coals.\n2. Cover your barbeque with an upturned roasting pan if you have no lid.: Use bricks to create 2 side walls and a back wall. Each should be 2 bricks high. Leave the front and top spaces open. The distance between the 2 side walls should be small enough that the roasting pan sits firmly and safely on top of them.\n\nThe pizza is cooked by placing it into the space inside the \"walls\" and placing the roasting pan on top to radiate heat down onto the pizza.\nPractice utmost care with this method to avoid burns.\nRemove the roasting pan when the pizza is cooked to access the pizza. If it's browning too quickly on top, remove it from underneath the pan.\n3. Place bricks around the barbeque to provide a more even heating.: If you'd like, you can place clean bricks around the barbecue before preheating to simulate a baker's oven. It will take more time to preheat adequately using bricks, but the heat will be more even and appropriate for cooking pizza.\nYour bricks should be free of any dirt that could burn and wrapped in tinfoil for maximum security.\n4. Preheat your grill: Clean the plate with dish soap before and after use. Give it at least 10 to 15 minutes of preheat time to burn off any debris. If the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and overpower the flavor of your pizza.\n\nIf your barbecue has no flat plate (only slotted or bar grills), cook the pizza on a heavy cast iron skillet, a pizza stone, or other heavy-duty and flame-proof flat pieces of cookware.\nA high temperature is essential to making a really good thin crust.\n5. Place 1 pound (0.45 kg) of pizza dough onto a slightly floured surface.: Sprinkle some flour onto an appropriate surface, such as a peel, baking sheet, or chopping board.\n\nEither purchase dough from a local grocery story or create your own. If you make your own dough, wholemeal flours or fine cornmeal make for a more protein-rich and chewier dough. However, they also take longer to cook through.\nBe sure to temper the dough if you make it yourself—this is when you let the dough come to room temperature so the gluten can settle a bit.\n6. Roll your dough outwards into a circle with a diameter of 12 inches (30 cm).: Drag the roller in up and down motions along the dough. Thin crust pizza should be between 0.25 to 0.125 inches (0.64 to 0.32 cm) thick. Be sure to rotate the dough and flatten it in as many directions as possible to ensure a consistent thickness.\n\nTry and create a thin crust – most barbecue pizzas have thinner crusts and few raw ingredients because they cook from the base up.\nA barbecue with really good heat control can allow more variations to crust thickness and structure; you'll need to experiment to learn what works best with your own barbecue.\nYou can precook or pre-grill the base in advance and then freeze it. The bases do freeze very well, so try making a batch of them at a time.\n7. Slice each of your toppings into pieces with consistent thicknesses.: Use 3 toppings at most. Common pizza toppings include green peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. You can also use spinach, artichokes, and other less common options. For meats, pepperoni, sausage, and chicken are common.\nIf you want to keep it simple, make a barbecued pizza by briefly cooking your dough on both sides like a pancake. Afterwards, brush it with herb and garlic oil and either eat it as is or wrap it around other foods.\n8. Cook raw meat toppings before adding them to your pizza.: This is especially important for seafood and chicken. You don't want your meat to come out too rare. It's best to place meat closer to the edges of the pizza to cook it faster.\nUse your cooked meat as soon as possible. If you have leftovers, store it in sealed, clean containers on a lower shelf in your fridge at 41 °F (5 °C) or lower. Keep all cooked meat separate from ready-to-eat food and raw meats.\n9. Place your ingredients onto a platter with the necessary tools.: The platter should contain all of your toppings (sliced, cut, or shredded), sauce, olive oil, a cooking brush, a spoon, and a large spatula.\nA pair of tongs is also useful, but not necessary.\n10. Place your pizza onto a peel.: You can also improvise with a wooden chopping board, baking sheet, or other flat item to allow the smooth transfer of pizza onto the barbecue plate.\nIf you're using a homemade dough and not a pre-cooked base, try not to allow the dough to rise too much or it will go soft and tear easily.\n11. Brush the top of the pizza with olive oil.: Apply olive oil to your cooking brush and gently brush it along the top of your pizza. Continue applying until the surface of the dough has a thin layer of oil.\n12. Heat your pizza olive-oil side down for 1 to 2 minutes with a lid.: Remove the grill's lid and gently lay the dough onto the grill. Give your dough about 3 minutes to cook without a lid, or between 1 to 2 minutes if you're keeping the lid on.\nLift the dough with your tongs every 30 seconds. Your pizza should be cooking enough that there are grill marks on it, but it shouldn't be crispy.\n13. Flip over your crust using a spatula.: Place a spatula under the dough as far as possible, and place your free hand on the unheated top portion of the dough. Gently turn the dough over and lay it onto the grill.\n\nYour pizza dough should come off easily without tearing. If it's delicate enough that it tears or looks like it might, keep it on for another 30 seconds and then check it again.\nIf your crust is getting browned on just one side, rotate it 90-degrees with your spatula or tongs and cook it for another 1 minute.\n14. Brush the top with olive oil and add 1 ladle of sauce.: Pour some olive oil onto your cooking brush and gently brush it over the grilled surface of your pizza. Afterwards, scoop 1 ladle of sauce onto the pizza and use the bottom of a spoon to spread it evenly across.\nYou can use more than 1 ladle if you like extra sauce, but you risk the pizza getting soggy.\n15. Add your toppings and cheese onto the cooked side.: Start by layering your toppings evenly around the pizza. Afterwards, sprinkle your cheese over the top of the pizza, and if you're adding meat add it on top of the cheese. Avoid flooding your pizza with toppings, particularly cheese and different sauces.\n\nCheese caramelizes quickly and melts, so too much may cause the toppings to ooze.\n\nToo much cheese can also be a flame risk and smoke the pizza beyond eating.\n16. Cook the pizza for 3 to 5 minutes on gas grills.: After adding your toppings, close the lid and let your pizza cook. Use your smell and best judgment to gauge the cooking process—if you smell burning, remove the lid. You can also move the pizza to a cooler part of the grill.\nIf your pizza keeps burning even after moving the pizza or removing the barbeque lid, decrease the temperature to around 500 to 550 °F (260 to 288 °C).\n17. Close the vents for 2 to 3 minutes for charcoal grills.: Be sure to close the vents on the cover nearly all the way. After 2 to 3 minutes, or whenever the cheese begins to bubble and the bottom chars, pull it off the grate with your spatula and place it onto a cutting board for 1 to 2 minutes before serving it.\nRemove the pizza when the cheese looks sufficiency melted.\n18. Slice your pizza into 4 pieces.: Gently hold the side of the crust and cut a straight vertical line down your pizza. Afterwards, cut a horizontal line through the first cut to make 4 even slices.\n\nYou add another 1 or 2 diagonal cuts if you want smaller pieces, but 4 pieces is the ideal amount for this size of pizza.\nIf there are various people eating with you, ask for several helpers to keep tending the pizza cooking so that you can share the duties and enjoy eating when your own pizza is ready.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "I'm interested in learning how to answer tough questions in an interview. Could you break it down into 24 easy-to-follow steps?", "output": "1. Talking about your strengths and positive accomplishments may be harder than you think. To prepare for questions regarding this, you should write down a list of your greatest strengths and achievements.\n2. Write down the most relevant work experiences you've had, and strengths that have followed you from job to job. Adding a recent concrete example of a recent work experience will give credence to your pitch.\n3. Once you've written down all the elements to your pitch, you can put it together into a cohesive statement. Start with an introductory statement about your experience, and then talk about your positive personality traits. Try to frame your experience in a realistic and concrete way.\nAn example of a good pitch would be something like \"I'm a 30 year veteran in writing and editing. My last job was as a senior editor at Shark Publishing Co. While I was there, I wrote over 30 different published manuscripts and manuals. One of the best things about me is that I'm a hard worker and always meet deadlines. As an example, last year we had a deadline that we didn't get the details for until two days beforehand. I worked 12 hours straight to make sure that the content got in on time.\"\n4. You can use your pitch to answer questions like \"Tell me about yourself,\" \"What experience do you have that would help you in this role?\" and \"What are your greatest accomplishments?\"\n5. Typical questions include \"Tell me about a time when you failed,\" \"Why did you leave your last job?\" and \"What are your greatest weaknesses?\" Take these questions into consideration and start to form answers to them.\nThese questions aren't aimed to make you feel bad or for you to reveal your current weaknesses, but are meant to expose how you learn from mistakes and how well you rebound from failure.\n6. When asked about weaknesses or mistakes that you've made in the past, make sure to highlight how these challenges made you grow professionally. Employers are looking for areas where you believe you could use improvement, as well as how well you can rebound from failure.\n\nIf asked about why you left your last job, you can talk about limitations on your growth or advancement in the company.\nIf you've miscommunicated on a team and it led to a failure, don't talk about the failure as much as you talk about how it taught you that communication is critical.\n7. If you've ever had a negative experience, there was probably something to be learned. Instead of emphasizing the negative experience, practice talking about what you were able to get out of the experience.\nTo explain a weakness, you can say something like \"When we worked on the project at Boeing I was new at working in conjunction with a team. I didn't communicate my part of the project as well as I should have, so it affected our results. The experience helped me get used to effectively communicating with others, even if I wasn't great at it to begin with.\"\n8. When employers ask about your weaknesses, don't take a positive and try to frame it as a negative for the question. This comes off as disingenuous. An example of this would be \"I work so hard that sometimes I overwork.\" Instead, be realistic and concrete, and use specific examples whenever you can to explain the weakness.\n9. Often an interviewer will ask you a question to get more information about your personality, aptitude, and experience. Sometimes the question is aimed at learning something that isn't apparent. Think about the actual meaning behind each question before you give your response, and cater your answer to what they are actually asking.\n10. Blaming past coworkers for your own shortcomings could signal to the employer that you don't take responsibility for your actions and aren't a team player. Instead, talk about how their communication or management style didn't mesh well with yours, and emphasize how you were able to adapt and accomplish goals, even though this was so.\n\nIf the interviewer asks \"What did you dislike most about your last boss?\" they want to understand your expectations of management and understand which management styles you have trouble working with.\nYou can answer \"Tell me about your worst boss\" by saying something like \"I had a boss who communicated differently than me. I learned that you have to be able to adapt to different personalities if you want a project to get done on time.\"\n11. If they ask, \"Why are you better than anyone else for this job?\" they are looking to gauge your level of confidence and humility to see if you can fulfill expectations while still being a team player. Talk about your experience and why it makes you capable, but also talk about your passion for learning and getting better at your job.\nYou can say something like \"I have a decade of experience, and I work well with other people. Also, you won't meet a person more passionate about this than I am.\"\n12. Sometimes an interview will contain specific questions regarding your industry. These questions are designed to see if you understand the current standards and practices of the industry as well as your experience level. Make sure to have a solid grasp of the specific technical and operational aspects of your potential job.\nJobs, where you may be expected to have an intimate knowledge of your industry, include biotech, pharma, business, coding, IT, medical, design, and much more.\n13. Think of the goal of the interviewer and what they need out of a person to successfully fulfill the role. They also want to make sure that you would be a good team member and pleasant to work with. Think about what would benefit them the most, depending on what role they have in the company, and cater your answers to their role.\n\nFor example, an HR manager wants to know that you can communicate well with others and can adhere to the company culture.\nA director of a department will want you to communicate well and accomplish results in a safe and effective way.\nAn external recruiter will want to know that you have the experience for the job and are a good candidate to send to the employer.\n14. Sometimes an interviewer will ask you a question that is entirely unrelated to your industry or to the job that you're applying for. This is usually to see how you handle pressure and how you will react to the situation. The most important thing is to stay calm and to act like the question doesn't phase you.\nHiring managers want to see if you will become flustered or frustrated by the question.\n15. If you can, try to answer the question by thinking of a situation in your life that relates to it. For example, the hiring managers at Mastercard ask employees \"What do you do if you are approached by an employee who is complaining about a colleague who has horrible body odor?\" You could answer by saying something like \"Well, I actually had this issue in Highschool, and I was the smelly kid. The kids actually got me more interested in different sprays and colognes while we were in the locker room, and it helped me a lot. So I'd probably do something like that.\"\n16. Sometimes these questions are aimed to see what kind of person you'd be like to work with. For that reason, when given a strange or curveball question, just try to answer truthfully without coming off as disrespectful.\nFor example, Whole Foods Market hiring managers ask \"Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?\" You could say something like, \"A horse-sized duck would be terrifying and horrifying. I'd definitely go with the 100 duck-sized horses.\"\n17. Candidates who know about the business will stand out from their competitors. Do a search for the company's website and get a sense of their core values, company culture, target customers, and the products or services they provide.\n\nAs you do your research, write down any questions that you have so that you can ask the interviewer during the interview.\nAn excellent question to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview is something like \"What does it take for an individual to succeed in this role?\"\nSearch online for the most commonly asked questions in your industry and for your role.\n18. Practice answering tough interview questions in front of a mirror or record yourself using your webcam. Examine your body language, vocal tone, and face to see if you are doing anything strange or seem to lack confidence. Try to be open, have a smile on your face, and speak in a clear voice. Rehearse answering questions in front of family or friends and get their opinion.\nConfidence can be exhibited by your voice, body language, and facial expressions.\n19. The more prepared you are, the calmer you'll be in the interview. Memorize the name of the person who is interviewing you, make sure to select an outfit, and print out or look up directions the day before your interview. Before you go into the interview, review the job description again so that it's fresh in your mind.\nIf you are nervous because you are late or unprepared, you'll have a harder time answering tough questions.\n20. While you should never bring up salary without being prompted, having the answer in your head will make answering this tough question easier. Make sure that in addition to a monetary salary, you also have an answer for the things you'd want in benefits or additional bonus compensation if it's applicable to the job.\n21. One of the worst things that you can do when answering a tough question is ramble about something that isn't pertinent to the job or the position. Refrain from telling anecdotal stories from your childhood or personal likes and dislikes. Keep your answers short, accurate, and relatable to the role that you want to fill.\nA great way to keep on track is to talk about recent professional triumphs or victories.\n22. If you've prepared for the interview but the person interviewing you still throws you a curve ball, it's important that you take your time to think through your response deliberately. Pause for a moment and take the time to think about what you are going to say.\nNever answer a question with a \"No\" or \"I don't know.\" Aim to expand your answers to give the interviewer some context.\n23. When you arrive early, it gives you time to relax and concentrate on the interview. Make sure to plan your route the night before so that you can get to the interview feeling confident and prepared.\n24. Visualize yourself doing great on the interview and getting the job. Don't underplay your abilities or talk negatively about your past. Have confidence in what you do and try to smile throughout the interview.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "How to get rid of dark spots from acne?", "output": "1. See a dermatologist.: Make an appointment with a dermatologist, which is a doctor who specializes in skin and hair. Let them examine your skin and get a detailed medical history. They might ask about your skincare routine, too.\nAsk your dermatologist about a skin lightening cream like hydroquinone, which is available in OTC-strength (2%) and prescription-strength (4%) formulas.\n2. Get a chemical peel or acid treatment for indented scars.: The name for these indentations is atrophic scars. If you've got these, your dermatologist might suggest a chemical peel or a treatment using glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, or salicylic acid. Microdermabrasion, in which your skin is buffed down, and laser treatments also work well for these kinds of scars.\nFillers are another option for atrophic scars.\n3. Try silicone gel or cryotherapy for raised scars.: Raised scars are called hypertrophic scars. They respond better to silicone gel, steroid therapy, and cryotherapy (freezing). A pulsed dye laser treatment also works well for hypertrophic scars. See which your dermatologist recommends.\nInjections can also help flatten raised scars.\n4. Deal with the acne first.: Treating the acne also treats the dark spots and prevents new ones from forming. Wash your skin twice a day with a gentle cleanser and rinse with lukewarm water. Avoid touching or picking at your blemishes and protect your skin from the sun.\n\nUse products that contain salicylic acid and/or a retinoid to help clear up your skin.\n\nSometimes you may be left with dark spots after your acne heals, called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). PIH can occur in anyone, but tends to occur in darker-skinned individuals.\n5. Lighten dark spots with hydroquinone.: Head to the pharmacy and pick up a 2% hydroquinone cream. Apply it twice a day by dabbing a little bit on each dark spot.\n6. Use a product that contains niacinamide and tranexamic acid.: The combination of these 2 ingredients can help lighten dark spots. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3. Look for a cream containing these ingredients and use it according to the instructions.\n7. Apply a vitamin C serum to the dark spots.: A serum made with vitamin C can help fade the marks. Pick one up from your local pharmacy and apply it as directed.\nKeep in mind that vitamin C can irritate your skin, and it may cause your skin to burn if you go out in the sun after you use it.\n8. Wear sunscreen every day.: Put on sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher each day. UV rays from the sun or tanning beds can make dark spots worse. Additionally, some dark-spot treatments can make you more sensitive to the sun.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What challenges did you face when developing a device to test the PW-Sat 2 satellite-deorbiting sail release mechanism?", "output": "Our friends from PW-Sat 2 team need to test their satellite-deorbiting sail release mechanism. To make conditions as close to the real ones as possible, the test is to be performed in a specialised laboratory - in vacuum and without gravity. Vacuum is created by pumping out air, and lack of gravity by free fall from a tower. So the device is to be dropped from some height in a vacuum. As you might expect, the problem here is time - we have only ~1.2 seconds before the device hits the safety net placed at the tower’s base.\nThe sail release mechanism is actuated by electromagnet, so we need a device which can detect its fall (free fall detection), and control the current flow through the controlling electromagnet. And that device needs to respond quickly. Sail release itself also takes time, so we have 1.2 seconds to detect the free fall, AND fully release the sail.\nTo detect free fall we use an accelerometer. We also need to log the data during the fall, so we store all the data from the accelerometer to an SD card. Everything is wired up through an Arduino device.\nFortunately, we don’t need to implement the free fall detection algorithms by ourselves, as the ADXL345 accelerometer we are using here has this functionality built in. We just need to set some parameters. For free fall detection this are the freeFallThreshold (sensitivity of detection) and freeFallDuration. After that, we can read the freeFall interruption to check if the device is falling or not. All of this takes only a few milliseconds, about 3 to 10, usually 5.\nAnother task for us is to log all data from the accelerometer to a file on an SD card. For this purpose we have executed a number of tests with the standard Arduino SD handling library and an SD card adapter (or a simple Arduino Ethernet Shield with SD Card Reader) connected via SPI interface.\nHere some problems become apparent. In each loop, we can read the accelerometer state (free-fall interruption and acceleration on all 3 axis), open a file on the SD card, write the data (append to the file), and close the file. This entire sequence of operations takes about 20 milliseconds (depending on the SD card used). That’s significantly more than the 5 ms we anticipated.\nOne solution is to open the file once, and then only write the data. However, if we don’t close the file, the data is buffered in-memory and we have no control of when, or if at all, it’s actually written to the SD card. The solution is to open the file, write the data N times (in our case, 100), then close the file (it flushes the data to the SD card and makes sure it’s actually written) - and open it again.\nAnother solution is to use a 3rd-party SD library called SdFat which allows fast data writes using a binary format. After a couple of initial tests we have discovered that the write operations are indeed super fast, but the binary format brings some new problems for the PW-Sat 2 team.\nIn the end, we have decided to use the best of both worlds - combining the speed of the SdFat library and the convenience of the CSV file format.\nThe last task of our device is to release the sail. To do it we need to control the electromagnet, which we accomplish via a simple relay. There is no complicated logic here - we fix specific pins for output, then, when free fall is detected, just set those pins to HIGH, which energizes the relay - this, in turn, de-energizes the sail-release electromagnet.\nTo test the device, we also needed some source of power, namely a battery, because tossing a device with a cable attached is quite cumbersome, and a cable socket can be easily damaged due to the drop.\nJust recently we found out that out of 474 amazing Polish software development firms we’ve earned a position in the TOP 5!!!\nHow to communicate with a sattelite when there is no Internet on the orbit.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the history of the US government’s apology for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.", "output": "Her use of the phrase “now considered” is worth noting. In that case, it took decades for the White House and lawmakers to admit that the U.S. government had been wrong.\nIt’s been just about 30 years since President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. That law paid out reparations of about $20,000 to every survivor of those internment camps “to right a grave wrong,” as he put it, which the law blamed on “racial prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.” But, as noted by Mae Ngai, professor of Asian American Studies and professor of History at Columbia University, the apology and reparations came more than a generation after President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 led to the rounding up of 120,000 Japanese-Americans, most of whom were U.S. citizens.\nIn early 1942, when Roosevelt signed that now-infamous order, the attack on Pearl Harbor of Dec. 7, 1941, was at the top of Americans’ minds. Many worried that, though actual sabotage was confined to rumor, the tens of thousands of American citizens whose families had come from Japan would turn on them. Roosevelt’s order allowed the military to exclude people from certain areas in the name of national security, and that translated to removing the Japanese-American population from much of the West Coast and putting them in camps for years.\nSome protested at the start. Sen. Robert Taft was notably, according to historian Eric Foner’s overview of the debate, the only person to speak out in Congress against the order. The Quaker community opposed the move too, and TIME carried a reader letter that asked rhetorically whether there were any “greater atrocity in the annals of American history.” But the decision generally went down well in Washington. Groups like the NAACP and the American Jewish Committee that might be assumed to have opposed the internment did not speak up, and TIME described the mood on the West Coast as a “sigh of relief” that Roosevelt was protecting the people. Sen. Taft eventually stopped his protest. And in 1944, in the case of Fred Korematsu, an Oakland-born steel welder who tried and failed to resist the order to relocate, the Supreme Court upheld the idea behind the internment camps.\nIt was after the war ended, amid a shift in post-war relations with Japan, Ngai says, that public opinion began to change — slowly.\n“As early as the 1950s, once the Communist revolution happened in China, and the Korean War, the U.S. considered Japan its number-one ally,” says Ngai.\nBy the early 1960s, TIME referred to the internment camps as “an ugly footnote” to the story of the war. Even so, the public apology was still decades away; acknowledging that the camps were “ugly” was not the same as saying they were a bad decision. When the government settled claims for property lost during that period, it avoided passing judgment on FDR’s choice.\nIt was later in the 1980s, after Congress established a Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, that the public learned the grisly details of the relocation process and life inside the camps, as internees testified at public hearings.\nJapanese Americans at the Tule Lake segregation center in 1944.\nTule Lake Photo essay by Carl Mydans from the Mar. 20, 1944 issue of LIFE magazine.\nA turning point came when Peter Irons, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, obtained key documents through a Freedom of Information Act request. The records detailed an internal investigation revealing that the federal government knew that Japanese-Americans weren’t actually a national security threat at all. In one document, “FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover stated that he could find no evidence to support the War Department’s contention that West Coast Japanese were signaling Japanese warships off the coast,” according to TIME’s reporting back then.\nThose revelations formed the basis of a new case for Fred Korematsu. Nearly 40 years later after the original judgment in his case, he was able to show that the government lied to justify the evacuation. The claim that the internment of Japanese-Americans was justified by security concerns had never been based on serious threats.\nIn November of 1983, a federal judge in California vacated his conviction. As TIME summed up the legal perspective on both sides, “The Justice Department did not acknowledge any Government misconduct, but decided against fighting the case on the ground that the evacuation program was ‘an unfortunate episode in our nation’s history’ that would best be ‘put behind us.’ U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel pronounced the Government’s mealymouthed statement ‘tantamount to a confession of error.’ She added that the Supreme Court’s decision was ‘based on unsubstantiated facts, distortions and misrepresentations.'” Though the Supreme Court precedent technically still stands, Korematsu was effectively overturned.\nFive years later, more than four decades after one of his predecessors signed the original order, President Reagan signed the official apology.\nNgai notes that there are some key differences between situation today and how Japanese-Americans were detained during World War II, but she says she sees value in Bush’s having drawn the connection. After all, a lesson that took 40 years to be confirmed is one that ought not be forgotten quickly.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

They found that the upper edge of land suitable for crop growth could shift as far north as 1,200 km (745 miles) from its current position. The most dramatic changes would occur in the inner-continental regions of North America and Eurasia.\nAs of 2018, only 32% of the boreal region falls into 'growing degree days' – the climate parameter linked to crop growth – and rainfall requirements for small cereal crops, such as oats and barley. However, based on detailed climate models, more than three-quarters (76%) of the boreal region could provide suitable conditions for agriculture by the year 2099. The researchers present their work in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.\nHowever, the study also warns that while total rainfall will generally increase on an annual basis, a warmer climate will also lead to more evaporation with potentially dramatic impacts on the climatic water balance – both geographically and across seasons. For example, while regions around the oceans' rims could see an increase in water available to crops, inner continental regions may suffer drought conditions during the summer.

The New York Times is now demanding an apology, although as I write this, the story remains live on Fox News’ site.\nAccording to the Times, the president sent the tweet 25 minutes after Fox News broadcast a report attributed to comments by Gen. Tony Thomas. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado on Friday, Thomas said a 2015 lead on the location of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al–Baghdadi was “leaked in a prominent national newspaper,” and that al–Baghdadi was tipped off by the report and escaped. He did not mention The New York Times by name.\nBut a review of the record shows that information made public in a Pentagon news release more than three weeks before the Times article, and extensively covered at the time by numerous news media outlets, would have tipped off Mr. Baghdadi that the United States was questioning an important Islamic State operative who knew of his recent whereabouts and some of his methods of communication. Further, the information in the Times article on June 8 came from United States government officials who were aware that the details would be published.\nOops.

{"input": "I once read that JRR Tolkien, a linguist by profession and of The Lord of the Rings fame, wrote his masterpiece using elements of archaic English to emulate the Bible. Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration 'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!' A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.' A sword rang as it was drawn. 'Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.' 'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!' Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. 'But no living man am I!' -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular 'archaic'. I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the 'opinion-based' part of the question.", "output": "The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's 'Westu Theoden hal!' taken directly from Beowulf's 'Ws u, Hrogar, hal', as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, 'On Translation' for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous 'tushery' (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter 'The Stewart and the King' from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the 'sudden joy as poignant as grief' of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

To others, it is a slur meant to silence and discredit.\nCampus feminist groups contacted by The College Fix expressed support for transgender ideology and a rejection of so-called TERF politics.\nA representative of Indiana University’s Feminist Student Association told The College Fix via Facebook Message that the organization does not support “trans-exclusionary” feminism. “IU FSA is not trans exclusionary. Feminism is intended to be supportive, inclusive and empowering so we do not support or promote any branches of feminism that seek to isolate marginalized populations like trans individuals,” the representative said.\n“Feminism is for everyone. Gender is personal and it is in opposition to our beliefs and goals to follow strict definitions of masculinity or femininity and gender,” the representative added.\nReached by The Fix via email, Becca Vorrick, the editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine “FEM” at the University of California, Los Angeles, echoed the Indiana group’s response stance.\n“FEM is not trans-exclusionary — we fully support trans folks, as well as gender non-conforming and non-binary folks. As intersectional feminists, we do not support the ideology of TERFs. We oppose biological and gender essentialism,” Vorrick said.\n“The purposes of feminist movements have been clouded by TERF ideology officially since the 1970s — TERF ideology is not new to the movement, and intersectional feminist historically argued against it. At FEM, we maintain that legacy through our own intersectional analyses,” she added.\nFeminists elsewhere have been critical of transgender ideology. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian author, activist, and feminist, has said that she does not equate trans-women’s experiences with women’s experiences. “I think if you’ve lived in the world as a man with the privileges of the world accords to men and then sort of changed or switched gender, it’s difficult for me to accept that then we can equate to your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning in the world as a woman,” Adichie has argued.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The moral, human thing is to make clear: 'Please don't come,'\" Orban told reporters.\nIn a later news conference, Orban said the history of Ottoman rule meant Hungarians would not accept large-scale Muslim immigration, a point made recently by neighboring Slovakia.\n\"We don't want to, and I think we have a right to decide that we do not want a large number of Muslim people in our country,\" Orban said. \"We do not like the consequences of having a large number of Muslim communities that we see in other countries, and I do not see any reason for anyone else to force us to create ways of living together in Hungary that we do not want to see.

As the train platform filled with police came into view, those inside chanted their disapproval and their determination to reach Germany, their almost unanimous goal.\nThe crowd, angrily waving train tickets to Vienna and Munich, refused police orders to board buses to the asylum center, pushing their way past police and back onto the train. A day-long standoff ensued in which police and charity workers took turns handing food and water to the passengers, only to have them tossed out train windows in protest.\n\"We don't need food and water! Just let us go to Germany!\" one man shouted. Children held up handwritten signs reading, \"Let's Go Germany.\"\nOne man threw his wife and infant son onto the tracks, screaming in Arabic, \"We won't move from here!\" Police surrounded the prone family, pulled the husband away and handcuffed him as he wailed. His wife and diaper-clad boy, apparently uninjured despite their stumbling descent onto the tracks, were freed and allowed to rejoin other refugees.\nThe scene of desperation was just one of many that unfolded Thursday as tempers flared in Hungary's war of wills with refugees trying to evade asylum checks and reach Western Europe, a showdown with consequences for the entire continent.\nAbout 100 police kept watch on the train, escorting media – including Al Jazeera reporter Andrew Simmons – from the platform, but didn't remove the refugees by force.\nThe head of police border control, Col. Laszlo Balazs, said 16 people voluntarily checked into the asylum center, while about 500 others refused. He said officers were using loudspeakers to inform those who would not comply of \"their legal obligations.\"\n\"Nobody can avoid identity checks. Everyone must submit themselves to this measure, and the police are keeping this train in place until they do,\" he said.\nBack at the Budapest train station, announcements in Hungarian and English – but not Arabic, the language of most of those gathered inside – declared that all services from the station to Western Europe had been canceled.

It's used for internal purposes.\nOf course, it can be argued that he question that is not written is actually more a long the lines of, \"which button should we press?\"\nDoes your answer answer that question? No it does not. It only informs the decision that the OP can now make. Could the answer be improved by giving a recommendation? Sure. Is a recommendation necessary to answer the question as written? No.\nThere's another problem that in my view sparked this discussion that plagues many questions where the OP cannot know what information is out there. Sometimes it's just a snippet that's out there, but that's okay. If a better answer does come along from someone who found more information or maybe from a SmartThings engineer with internal knowledge that answer should get more appreciation.\nAlas, sometimes there isn't more information. We cannot ask of every person answering to make a research project out of it. In short, if you provide an authoritative or at least credible source that does point the OP in the right direction by either answering the question as written or as intended — hopefully both — that can be posted as answer. It's not pulitzer worthy, but it is an answer.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

It was supposed to be the ultimate flagship offer, complete with a 5.7-inch OLED touchscreen of 4K resolution and a 'tall' 18:9 aspect ratio.\nNothing is certain quite yet, but clues have been amassing lately that the Pro's release is nearing. Starting with a trio of FCC reports, with the following IDs: PY7-24118Q, PY7-21831A and PY7-00718V. These can be found on FCC's website and looking at the included device dimensions, the PY7-21831A is clearly describing the Xperia XZ2, while the PY7-24118Q - the XZ2 Compact.\nThat leaves the PY7-00718V and reading through the documents on record, tells a rather interesting story. It appears at one point, Sony requested a cancellation for the ongoing certification, because of a cited change in the design. That happened shortly before MWC 2018 kicked off, hinting that the device missed on the Barcelona expo due to some last minute change. Still, looking at the same PY7-00718V document collection today (linked in the source) reveals some new activity - likely a sign of ongoing development on Sony's part.\nThe other bit of the story comes in the shape of UAProfs (User Agent Profiles). As most of you probably know, these are essentially machine-friendly descriptions of devices, that often surface prior to actual device announcements and offer some tech info, like display resolution. Well, going back a month or so ago, when people were digging around for the new Xperia devices, three model designations were unearthed in UAProf - H82XX, H83XX and H81XX.\nThe Xperia XZ2 we have at the office reports H8266, while the XZ2 compact is H8324. So, that only leaves the H81XX pattern and as luck would have it, a new UAProf was recently leaked, describing a H8176 device. In it, two really essential pieces of information: Android 8.1 and a native resolution of 4320 x 2160 pixels.\nIt seems like the only question that remains is when will Sony unveil the new device.

Which one is correct?.", "output": "You are thinking of noun adjuncts, or attributive nouns. Both Wikipedia and someone from Pearson Education state that traditionally, all attributive nouns are singular. However, the number of plural attributive nouns have increased over the years in a rather arbitrary manner. This means that there is no longer a set rule to determine whether the attributive is singular or plural. Despite this, there is a rough guide that you can use. The attributive noun tends to be plural in the following situations: 1: The singular form might lead to ambiguity an arts degree (a degree in the humanities) as opposed to an art degree (a degree in fine art) [I believe that this situation is what is referred to on wikipedia as 'lexical restrictions', providing the example of 'arm race' vs 'arms race'] 2. There is no singular form of a noun (in pluralia tantum) a customs officer 3. There is a need to denote variety a soft drinks manufacturer [but] a car manufacturer 4. A topical issue comes forth, often in newspaper stories... the tapes issue the tapes compromise the Watergate tapes affair the White House tapes mystery and other examples, including jobs cut. [I am not entirely sure what the point of this fourth category is] [Source: Pearson Education , directly quoted apart from what is enclosed inside square brackets] To this list I add my own: 5. [The attributive noun is plural if] it comes from the possessive form of the word teachers union ladies man However, this is more of an explanation rather than a rule you can use. There are too many exceptions, and you are unlikely to know the origins of the word. It doesn't make sense that it is teachers union but not students council. Note that we often 'choose by ear and it doesn't matter (employee lounge, employees lounge)' (Chicago Manual of Style). I would argue that it would be easier to just look it up every time and memorise words instead of trying to find a rule or categorise them.

He challenges Somayaji and asks him if no heavy rains fall, will he give up Vedas and accepts atheism, to which Somayaji agrees.

CanCan provides a simple and powerful way to describe and enforce access rules in your controllers. From a simple blog to a vast, multi-tenanted, service oriented application, CanCan has been with me through it all and made my life much easier in the process.\nWithin the last year, Ryan announced on Railscasts that he was taking a (much deserved) hiatus and since then, CanCan has seen minimal to no updates. The community has been incredibly helpful, providing a multitude of pull requests to fix and enhance various issues, including Rails 4 and Strong Parameter support, but without Ryan at the helm to merge these in and release new versions of CanCan, most of these developers are sticking to their own various forks and the community becomes fragmented.\nTo give back to a community that has supported and helped me so much, and hopefully with Ryan’s blessing, I have begun to maintain a continuation of CanCan.

Looking at the 3 questions posted with this tag, though, they're all about pathfinder-2e. Yet I'm sure that if the Champion subclass in 5e wasn't so simple (i.e. there are very few issues to ask about in the first place), it would have been used for 5e questions as well (unless maybe it did, and the tag got deleted automatically at some point because of low use; the pathfinder-2e questions are all relatively new).\nEither way, the tag will likely be used for 5e questions in the future, turning this into another fuzzy multi-system (sub)class tag.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle tags like those above (I probably missed a few). Some of them are 5e-exclusive by virtue of the tag wiki, even though other systems/editions use the same term for something as well. Some are D&D-specific (potentially including pathfinder), but not to be used for other systems that use the same term for something.\nAnd other ones are super-generic and about as useful as a \"sword-user\" tag would be. More precisely, I'm hoping nobody here has real-world knowledge of assassination beyond watching Léon: The Professional, so having e.g. a gold badge for the assassination tag would be absolutely meaningless, as it encompasses lots of different systems or contexts.\nIs this inconsistent handling of subclass tags a problem in the first place, or am I being too pedantic?

Most character archetypes can appear in any number of systems and thus the tag should reflect that.\nIf the archetype, or at least the archetype by that specific name, is only occurring in a single system and/or we only have questions about it for that one system, there's nothing wrong with the tag excerpt describing it as occurring in that one system. That's more accurate, and makes it easier for a reader to understand what the tag (currently) refers to. If the archetype spreads to other systems, we can update the tag description to reflect that.\nIf you find a tag that is used across systems, or which should be, but it's tag description seems to limit it to a specific system, fix the tag description.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Describe the fan-created Legend of Zelda VR game.", "output": "Nintendo may have abandoned virtual reality gaming after its Virtual Boy flopped in 1995, but that hasn’t stopped fans from imagining how its famous franchises would look in VR. Independent developer Aklar_45 went much further than mere imagination, using Unreal Engine 4 to re-create some of The Legend of Zelda’s most memorable boss battles. The results are impressive — and a sign that if Nintendo doesn’t start working on modern VR games, its fans will.\nSome of the developer’s videos show how direct first-person fights could work against classic Zelda villains — big bad Ganondorf and giant skeleton Stallord. Looking through Link’s eyes, the player picks up his famous Master Sword and Shield for melee attacks, switching to a bow and arrow for distant shots. When enemy projectiles approach, Link can swing his sword to volley them back, use his shield to absorb them, or teleport to dodge.\nBeyond the Zelda themes, what’s most striking about the demos is how deeply Unreal Engine 4 brings the environments to life with modern lighting and effects. Scenes that had relatively low stakes in the original Zelda games, such as fighting in a room with a collapsing floor, or relying on a basic bow in a dimly lit dungeon, suddenly have life-and-death consequences from a first-person perspective.\nThe only disappointment here is that there’s next to no chance that fans will actually get to play these VR demos on a Nintendo device. Each of the first-person VR sequences spun off from the developer’s year-long project to recreate a third-person Zelda title using Unreal Engine, and without Nintendo’s blessing — or Nintendo VR hardware — YouTube videos and PC demos will be the closest we can come to experiencing this ourselves.\nFor the time being, VR demos of individual battles can be downloaded for free for Armogohma, Darknut, Ganon, Ganondorf, Stallord, and Volvagia using links within the YouTube videos. As RoadtoVR points out, the demos were designed to be played on the HTC Vive, but work on the Oculus Rift with some compromises. One can only hope that Aklar_45 receives a job offer from Nintendo rather than a cease and desist letter, as there’s a lot to love here.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the influence of Kraftwerk on popular music.", "output": "The building’s exterior, typical of German post-war reconstruction styles, does not reflect what took place behind the non-descript door. There, however, in Mintropstrasse 16, in a somewhat seedy neighbourhood area near the Düsseldorf central railway station , a revolution in music started some four decades ago. In stark contrast to the monumentalised Abbey Road studios in London where The Beatles recorded most of their songs, there is no indication that this was once home to the Kling Klang Studio where Kraftwerk recorded their seminal albums in the 1970s. Techno, house, dance, trance, and also much contemporary R&B: they all owe a debt to these German pioneers of electronic music. Even now, some forty years later, “‘Autobahn’ still sounds like a road map for the musical future” according to Stephen Dalton (2015) in a recent issue of Uncut.\nIn the early 1970s, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider, both students at the Robert-Schumann-MusikHochschule in Düsseldorf, decided to create their own kind of music which would not be based on the dominant American or British templates of pop music, returning instead to rather high-brow European sources of inspiration. So no Chuck Berry, Elvis, Dylan, Beatles or Rolling Stones, but instead icons of German music: Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and, importantly, Karlheinz Stockhausen, who broke new ground by playing Bach on what was then a new instrument, the Moog synthesiser. Following the example of the latter, they opted for a completely electronic instrumentation. In 1974, they scored an international hit with a shortened version of Autobahn, their minimalistic ode of 22 minutes to the iconic German highway. The album cover showed a highly stylised, almost completely empty highway save for one Volkswagen and one Mercedes, both archetypical images of the German Wirtschaftswunder, within an almost mythical mountainous landscape as backdrop. The cover, influenced by Joseph Beuys who taught at the art school in Düsseldorf, made clear from the start that Kraftwerk was not just about music, but aimed at a total work of art or Gesamtkunstwerk of music, imagery, and dress (Buckley, 2012). Later on, with the Man Machine album, when influences from filmmaker Fritz Lang (Metropolis) and Soviet constructivist El Lissitzky, both from the 1920s, were absorbed, nostalgia and the future seamlessly blended.\nWith chart success in both the UK and the US, German music now came to be associated more with avant-garde than with the risible schmaltz of the Schlager music. David Bowie, prominent trendsetter and tastemaker in the 1970s, was one of the torchbearers. He was hit by “their singular determination to stand apart from stereotypical American chord sequences and their wholehearted embrace of a European sensibility” (Dalton, 2015: 49). Others, among them former Roxy Music member Brian Eno and the composer of minimal music Philip Glass, were also inspired by Kraftwerk.\nEven more remarkable was the impact of Kraftwerk on the Afro-American music scene. A recent BBC documentary, tells the story about a Kraftwerk concert in Detroit in 1981. On stage, four static and seemingly uncharismatic, robot-like musicians from the (West-)German upper-middle classes performing for a dominantly black audience with a rather different social background dancing to the rhythms of Trans Europe Express and Robots. Ralf Hütter later described the response of the audience as “very strong, very dynamic” (Hooper, 2013). Music and imagery, deeply embedded in an elitist European culture, apparently resonated with the thriving Afro-American music scene in Detroit, the city of Tamla Motown. A DJ prepped the ground for the breakthrough, suitably named Electrifying Mojo, who had a radio show targeting the Afro-American public. He thus embodies the crucial link between Kraftwerk and Techno, the electronic music genre born in Detroit and mother of a whole host of dance music styles.\nOne could also argue that Electrifying Mojo can be seen as the embodiment of a so-called global pipeline linking two spatially disparate clusters of music production and thereby contributing to processes of innovation. These clusters themselves are typically spatial concentrations of art worlds (not just artists, but also critics, tastemakers, Kloosterman, 2005) in combination with a dedicated infrastructure of institutions among them and, in the case of music, especially studios (Watson and Ward, 2013). Düsseldorf apparently provided such an environment in the 1970s. One could also argue that its initial relative isolation from other musical centres in combination with its rich cultural legacy was one of the conditions that fostered the creation of highly original new soundscapes and forms of representation. This, however, did not last and Düsseldorf has dropped off the radar as a centre of music innovation of global importance. The city evidently lacks the critical mass and the diversity of global cultural capitals as London, New York, and Los Angeles, which have been able to reproduce their creative milieus over extended periods of time.\nThere is, however, more than just sheer numbers to sustained creative milieus. A smaller city may specialise in a particular cultural industry and specific style. Such specialisation is fostered by the continued presence of an informed local clientele or, in the case of music, devoted fans helping to infuse the cityscape with meaningful signs referring to that music style. That I had to ask a local resident who happened onto the street if his ‘neighbor’ had indeed been home of the famous Kling Klang Studio goes some way to explain why Düsseldorf has remained a one-hit city wonder.\nRobert C. Kloosterman is Professor of Economic Geography and Planning at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. He is head of the research group Geographies of Globalisations. Part of his research activities are focused on cultural industries, including music. He has published the rise of black music in the US, on Morrissey, on the clustering of music in urban environments, and – together with Amanda Brandellero - on world music.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Beverly Hills brothers convicted in 1994 of murdering their parents, attracted a pair of brides while spending life in prison. So-called “Bundyphiles” sent bags of mail to Ted Bundy, the serial rapist-murderer who was electrocuted on Florida’s Death Row in 1989. \n  \n \"I reserve the right to care about you, Nikolas!\" wrotes a Texas woman in neat blue script in a letter addressed to the jail’s Post Office Box in Fort Lauderdale.

The inside of the card says, \"Out of sight, but never out of mind.\" \n  \n A teenager wrote on March 15: “I’m 18-years-old. I’m a senior in high school. When I saw your picture on the television, something attracted me to you.” \n  \n The letter was mailed from Texas and tucked inside an envelope covered with hand-drawn hearts and happy faces. “Your eyes are beautiful and the freckles on your face make you so handsome.” She goes on to describe herself as white with big, brown eyes. “I’m really skinny and have 34C sized breasts.” She ends the letter with three preschool-rated jokes about gummy bears and peanut butter. \n  \n A woman from Chicago enclosed nine suggestive photos, including a shot of cleavage, another in a skimpy bikini eating a Popsicle and a tight shot of her backside as she bent over. Another girl sent photos with Hello Kitty Snapchat filters. \n  \n An 18-year-old from New York wrote: “No one else is dealing w/your demons, meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend. I know you could use a good friend right now. Hang in there and keep your head up.\" The letter closes with hearts colored in pink ink. \n  \n \"There's piles of letters,\" said Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office is representing Cruz. \"In my 40 years as public defender, I've never seen this many letters to a defendant. Everyone now and then gets a few, but nothing like this.\" \n  \n Not all of the letters are from women. One card with a cat on the front is from an New York man sporting a bushy, gray, mustache. He enclosed photos of himself behind the wheel of his white, 1992 Nissan convertible. \n  \n Cruz has not seen the mail because he is on suicide watch, Finkelstein said. Customarily, inmates on suicide watch are locked in bare cells by themselves. \n  \n The jail opens inmates’ mail (except legal mail), according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office inmate handbook. Obscene mail or mail deemed to be a safety or security threat to staff is returned to the sender, the handbook says. \n  \n “We read a few religious ones to him that extended wishes for his soul and to come to God,” Finkelstein said, “but we have not and will not read him the fan letters or share the photos of scantily-clad teenage girls.” \n  \n Finkelstein said he worries “everyday boys and girls are starting to view him in an elevated way, looking up to his fame and notoriety.” \n  \n Confessed Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz appears in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom. \n  \n \"The letters shake me up because they are written by regular, everyday teenage girls from across the nation,” he said. “That scares me. It's perverted.” \n  \n Jail workers have been busy screening letters, photos, greeting cards, postcards and the occasional book sent to Cruz, jail records show. \n  \n Cruz requested a Bible, according to jail records released by the Broward Sheriff’s Office, but it was denied because of the suicide watch, the public defender said. \n  \n Cruz also now has $800 deposited into his growing commissary account, apparently sent by fans, Finkelstein said. From Feb. 15 through March 5, $630 was deposited, jail records show. The county deducts $8 per day for “subsistence fees.” \n  \n Inmates can use the commissary account to buy snacks, personal hygiene products, radios and coffee. \n  \n Cruz’s fan club also extends to Facebook, with several groups of empathizers forming to talk about his case and how they can help him avoid the death penalty. \n  \n On the “Nikolas Cruz – the First Victim,” a now-secret group that until recently had 300 members, one young woman solicited photos for a collage to send to the killer. “I want him to see how many people love and care for him and all the beautiful faces,” she posted. \n  \n The page features a photo of Cruz wearing a baseball cap and glasses along with the hashtags #StopBullying and #OurBoy #NikFam. \n  \n The group describes its mission as “in complete support of Nikolas Cruz. Whether or not he did this, he was completely failed. He deserved to get the help he needs and he deserves a fair trial.” \n  \n “I want you all to know that Nikolas knows about us and he had the biggest smile on his face when he was told that we all support him,” a female commenter wrote on March 16. “Keep the letters coming because he can’t wait to finally get them.” She wrote that “hate mail is filtered out so no one can upset our boy!!! Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate.” ||||| A 13-year-old boy from Central Florida told police he wanted to be “the next school shooter” — allegedly going so far as to keep photos of confessed Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz on his Playstation, along with images related to the Columbine massacre. \n  \n “He wanted to kill a lot of kids,” said the Polk County Sheriff’s Office in an official incident report, recalling the Kissimmee teen’s alleged statements to cops. \n  \n “He wanted to die and see God,” officials said, according to WESH Orlando. \n  \n “He wanted to shoot up Westside K-8 School (in Osceola County, where he attended) because he wanted to be the next school shooter.” \n  \n According to police, the boy had been found passed out on a sidewalk in Davenport on Saturday. \n  \n He told deputies that he swiped a bottle of booze from his parents’ liquor cabinet and used it to down a bunch of “happy pills.” The teen claimed that he drank the whole thing, according to WESH. \n  \n “He wanted to kill different kids because they ‘snitched’ on him and got him expelled from Westside K-8,” officials said, noting how he claimed to have been arrested and charged in the past for threatening a kid who “tried him.” \n  \n The boy told cops on Saturday that he buried a handgun in his neighbor’s backyard — because he was afraid his mother would find it — but no weapon was ever found. \n  \n “This teen is clearly in trouble,” explained Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. \n  \n “We hope he receives the treatment he needs to deal with his desires to hurt himself and others, but we have also placed him under arrest for felony aggravated stalking,” she said. “We cannot allow anyone of any age to get away with criminal threats to kill, especially when they are aimed towards schoolchildren.” |||||\"", "output": "Nikolas Cruz's brother wanted to start a fan club for the Parkland shooting suspect, but it looks like someone beat him to it.

Two-thirds of our year-end list is comprised of albums by women. Here, then, are the women (and a few men) who represented the best in Americana in 2017.\nIf a single moment best illustrates the current divide between Americana music and mainstream country music, it was Sturgill Simpson busking in the street outside the CMA Awards in Nashville. While Simpson played his guitar and sang in a sort of renegade-outsider protest, Garth Brooks was onstage lip-syncing his way to Entertainer of the Year. Americana music is, of course, a sprawling range of roots genres that incorporates traditional aspects of country, blues, soul, bluegrass, etc., but often represents an amalgamation or reconstitution of those styles. But one common aspect of the music that Simpson appeared to be championing during his bit of street theater is the independence, artistic purity, and authenticity at the heart of Americana music. Clearly, that spirit is alive and well in the hundreds of releases each year that could be filed under Americana's vast umbrella.\nAs mainstream country music continues to, for the most part, incorporate rock and hip-hop elements onto the charts and into the arenas, Americana music in 2017 was a twangier, often sparer affair. The other identifiable trend amid a genre so diverse is the diversity itself of the artists and output. If anything, in Americana, the present is female: Two-thirds of our year-end list is comprised of albums by women. Here, then, are the women (and a few men) who represented the best in Americana in 2017.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain why Donald Trump is refusing to implement sanctions against Russia for its interference in the US election.", "output": "The White House is refusing to implement sanctions against Russia for interfering in our election to install Donald Trump. The question is, why?\nOver the summer, Congress passed a bill imposing sanctions on Russia. But so far, Donald Trump has refused to do anything about it.\nAnd members of Congress are increasingly concerned that Trump is flagrantly ignoring a law that requires him to act.\nIt is a known fact, confirmed again and again by the entire intelligence community, that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, with the explicit purpose of helping Trump win. Trump still refuses to acknowledge this fact, dismissing it as a hoax and a Democratic conspiracy.\nThe most dangerous thing about Trump's refusal to accept the overwhelming evidence of Russia's actions is that he has done nothing to protect America and our democratic system from future attacks. That is why almost every single member of Congress voted over the summer for sanctions against Russia, with a deadline requiring Trump to act by Oct. 1.\nBut Trump has outright ignored that deadline.\nThe real question is, is this bureaucratic delay or has there been some conscious decision to lay off these sanctions, for example, until the president meets with Mr. Putin later this fall? I don't know the answer to that. If the president and the White House are consciously and deliberately delaying an action that's been mandated by Congress on something this important, that's pretty disturbing.\nThere are many questions about Trump's mysterious relationship with Russia — about his campaign's interactions with Russian operatives during the election, about his shady business dealings and investments in Russia, about his praise and defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBut as King notes, why Trump refuses to hold Russia accountable for attacking our country and trying to hack our election is \"pretty disturbing.\" The American people deserve answers and accountability. But most of all, we deserve a president who understands the seriousness of Russia's actions and will do absolutely everything in his power to stop it from happening again.\nTrump continues to prove he is not.\nPrevious articleTrump campaign lied, paid $5.9M to Russia-tied data firm it says played no \"key role\"", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.\"", "output": "John is interested in the history of science.

{"input": "Respond in detail. Explain why Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is poised to be a successful and popular game this holiday season.", "output": "While all eyes are on Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (many Switch newcomers will want this game) this holiday season for the Nintendo Switch, which dominated Black Friday sales, one game has slipped under the radar: Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Nintendo has been marketing the game strongly and technically, this is Nintendo’s holiday release; it comes out December 1. Fans of the series are ecstatic considering the game goes back to the roots of what made the original Xenoblade Chronicles so great: its story. Xenoblade Chronicles X was fantastic in its own right, but it lacked the characters and charm of the original. As the holidays fast approach, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a game poised to become Nintendo’s holiday surprise.\nTetsuya Takahashi may not be directing the game, but this game is his baby, no doubt. Very little know that Xenogears, the original installment in the Xeno series, was actually an early concept for Final Fantasy VII (!!!). The higher-ups at Squaresoft deemed it too dark to be a fantasy, thus the cult hit Xenogears was born. Takahashi went on to create the Xenosaga franchise for the PlayStation 2 but when sales were rather poor after the first game, development stopped on the fourth installment. While the games weren’t great, the story is among the best to grace the PlayStation 2, incorporating complex religious themes and taking much from Carl Jung’s philosophy, mixed in with aspects of Gnostic Christianity. While the games may not have been the greatest, the series was an engrossing experience.\nTakahashi was then young, but later matured, and later developed Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii. While it shared many of the themes of its predecessors, it is by far Takahashi’s crowning achievement and one of the best games to grace the system according to Metacritic, scoring a 92/100. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is going back to the series’ roots and is plot-driven with an expansive world, like its predecessor.\nWhile Zelda doesn’t quite count as a holiday game, so many are buying a Switch this holiday season (just look at the Black Friday sales) that they are bound to buy one of the greatest games of all time. Nintendo has done a masterful job at spreading out their release dates, with Super Mario Odyssey coming out on October 27. Fire Emblem Warriors came out a week before. This gives gamers plenty of time to be able to pick up Xenoblade Chronicles 2, which comes out on December 1. This takes a considerable amount of pressure off of the game. The fact that it’s coming out on an up-and-coming system doesn’t hurt either.\nThe problem with Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was released on the same date two years ago, was that it was the only holiday game for Nintendo on a dying system. The marketing for the game was abysmal. Nintendo has really pushed Xenoblade Chronicles 2, even giving it its own Nintendo Direct and releasing several trailers for the game and its own music video. The marketing has been superb, even receiving a special sidequest in Breath of the Wild to obtain Rex’s armor. Under Nintendo’s guidance, Monolith Soft’s games have scored an 84 or higher on Metacritic. Nintendo and Tetsuya Takahashi’s genius seem to be a perfect match for each other.\nThere are a good number of people who have never played a Xeno game who are either intent on buying a game or it is the game that sold them on the Nintendo Switch. This is huge. It shows the title is not simply a “niche” game like so many claim. It’s one of the most-wanted games for the Switch, and according to the November 29 issue of Famitsu, the most-wanted Nintendo Switch game. With all the hype Nintendo has built for the game with their excellent marketing, as long as it has stellar reviews, and previews indicate the game is superb, it’s going to be a must-have this Holiday 2017 season.\nThe Hype for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is real. Fans of the series and newcomers alike are ecstatic for the latest entry in the series. Nintendo took a chance on Monolith Soft and Tetsuya Takahashi years ago, and it’s paying off. Xenoblade Chronicles was a hit, despite a limited release in North America, totaling over one million sales (if the New Nintendo 3DS version is counted). Who knows if Digital sales from the Wii U are even taken into account in those numbers.\nXenoblade Chronicles X sold almost a million copies despite being on a dying system with barely any support from a marketing standpoint. There’s no reason why Xenoblade Chronicles 2 won’t be an even bigger hit, given it’s coming out on Nintendo’s crowning achievement during a holiday season where the Switch is dominating (just look at Black Friday). All of the trailers have also been incredibly intriguing, especially the character trailer. The story may rival Xenoblade Chronicles.\nNintendo is banking a lot on Xenoblade 2. Given their marketing for the game and the fact that it’s spread out from other Nintendo Switch releases, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is Nintendo’s holiday surprise.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Questions asking for an answer to a controversy\n\nIn this question:\nIs Jhana Required For Awakening?\nthe asker specifically states that they know it is a controversial topic (an understatement in this instance!). I assume we're going to get many such questions for the various traditions. I'm pretty sure we don't want to hash out controversies on this site; see the first answer to the above question for an example of an argument from one side - I could easily post an answer from the other side that would attempt to refute this answer.\nWhat should our policy be on this sort of question? What if the asker doesn't realize how controversial the question is? I assume questions like this one:\nWhy are Jhanas controversial?\nare less problematic; should we allow the controversial questions or advise that they be changed to those, like this second one, that ask for an outline of the controversy?\n\nA:\n\nTo ban question on question & answer site (because it have more than one answer) is a bit weird solution, which I also disagree, because there is many ways around of it.\nInstead of changing question to be about controversy it is also possible to just outline controversy in the answer.\nOr, answer could state that it presents just one point of view. Or, it maybe be enough if a commentary to such answer could state that it's just one point of view, without beginning dispute about it. One commentary to state that there exists another point of view is not yet dispute and should be allowed.\nWhat is actually bad in 'controversy' is disrespect to other tradition. It is not \"controversial\" when answers present some \"non-controversial\" subject from different points of view (w/o even acknowledge of existence of other points of view). It's only become offensive when there is 'only this is true' attitude (idealism) and derogation of other views (cynicism). So I believe what is actually need to be changed is just removal of disrespectful statements. Only disrespect need to be removed, and not different views.\nLike someone say, \"mahayana developed pseudo-sutras\" - there \"pseudo\" is disrespectful and biased.\nOr, \"abuse by generations of abhidharmists\" - it may have take-it-easy attitude and be funny to the author, but this is disrespect to the abhidharmic tradition.\nIt's may be normal in dispute if opponents pinch each other a bit, but in answer, which is not supposed to start a debate, such pinching is not needed.\nSo, in summary, instead of deleting questions, or asking to rephrase, or to make obligatory survey in the answer, I propose to delete derogatory statements only and allow single commentary to state existence of other point of view, and leave everything else as it is.\n\nA:\n\nValid concern. An example I found disturbing is (Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?). I like your idea of transforming questions of controversy into questions about controversy.", "output": "I'm not sure, this isn't a situation I've seen often on Stackoverflow or the StackExchange sites I visit.\nHowever, on the Buddhist sites I visit, I've seen:\n\nA complete ban on talking about Dorje Shugden (because the Dalai Lama and NKT are fighting about it)\nAll the vegetarian questions get herded into a single thread. This sort of applies to stack exchange, although I'd hate to see technical questions, like \"how do Chinese Buddhists fast\" closed because it's about vegetarianism and there is already a vegetarian question (where we are seeing all the same arguements pro and con regurgitated from probably the same epic battles on other forums)\nDitto for SGI Criticism-- these get herded into a single thread.  I'm not even sure if a naively worded SGI question like, \"Isn't SGI a cult? (or Isn't NKT a cult?\" probably should be closed for question quality reasons. I suppose if they were worded like, \"What sociologists have classified SGI or NKT as a cult?\" That would have an answer, while the former is just an invitation to Buddha-fight-club.\n\nWhat might be a better thing to do is to kill comment threads when they turn into massive forum-like discussions.

Except the root-and-branch destruction of the rookie class of 2014, that is. Yes, somewhere along the way, these young men ran afoul of the powers that rule the universe, which visit us only in dreams or in the broken-glass gargle of Tom Thibodeau. How else to explain this litany of fractures, sports hernias (ouch!), anti-rookie biases, and sundry other injuries and events that have plagued much of the class of 2014? Peer into the dark cauldron of blood with me now, IF YOU DARE.\n1. Andrew Wiggins — Has thus far escaped unscathed, unless you count LeBron preferring to play with Kevin Love.\n2. Jabari Parker — Tore his ACL 25 games into a probable rookie-of-the-year campaign. Went on to star in the second-best injury-rehab-centric sports commercial after Derrick Rose.\n3. Joel Embiid — Like many non-medical professionals, I’m not really up on anatomy nomenclature. You know, like, other than the obvious stuff. The foot, and its various constituent bones and parts, specifically, are anatomical deep cuts. Which is why it was troubling to know the name of the bone — the navicular — on which Embiid had surgery a mere six days before the draft. Embiid spent last season gaining understandable weight, and he now needs a bone graft on his slow-healing navicular.\n4. Aaron Gordon — Missed a sizable chunk of his rookie season after surgery on his broken foot. This July, he broke his jaw while “horsing around” with his brother (and former Sixer) Drew. “I am deeply saddened and sorry for hurting my brother. I love him and my family more than anything,” Drew said in a very personal statement on Twitter that totally wasn’t written by his agent and/or manager.\n5. Dante Exum — Tore his ACL in an exhibition against Slovenia. Danny Chau will likely miss the entire 2015-16 season.\n6. Marcus Smart — Had his fingers Lionel Hollins–ized in summer league.\n7. Julius Randle — Broke his leg in the fourth quarter of his first NBA game and missed the opportunity for Byron Scott to not play him enough.\n8. Nik Stauskas — Was drafted by the Kings.\n10. Elfrid Payton — Can’t shoot, but he’s fine. FOR NOW.\n11. Doug McDermott — Played only sporadically because Thibodeau is biased against rookies, causing rumors to swirl that McBuckets’s basketball coach father called the Bulls’ front office to complain. Which, considering Thibs’s then-relationship with the front office, would be like calling the DEA to complain about cocaine.\n12. Dario Saric — Is in Europe due to The Process.\n13. Zach LaVine — Won the slam dunk competition.\n14. T.J. Warren — Cracked a bone in his thumb.\n16. Jusuf Nurkic — Had knee surgery at the end of May. Is still the dude.\n20. Bruno Caboclo — Five years away from being five years and five months away from making topical musical references.\n21. Mitch McGary — Had back surgery in college, tested positive for weed during the Sweet 16 (I would argue that getting to the Elite Eight while high is, if anything, an accomplishment of sorts), then missed a bunch of his rookie NBA season after breaking a bone in his foot that isn’t the navicular. Still the best bench celebration guy in the league.\n23. Rodney Hood — The tendons in his feet are apparently made out of rubber bands slathered in sriracha hot sauce. He’s currently nursing a sore shoulder.\n24. Shabazz Napier — Was (allegedly) only drafted by Miami because LeBron tweeted “My favorite player in the draft. #Napier.” To be fair, James did use a hashtag, so Miami totally had to trade three picks to move up to grab Napier. Once LeBron returned to Cleveland, Shabazz became an orphan of sorts, and he has since been traded to the Magic.\n25. Clint Capela — Shoots free throws like he’s Steve McQueen in Papillon seeing the sunlight for the first time in months. Otherwise he’s fine.\n26. P.J. Hairston — Was involved in an altercation with a 17-year-old at a pickup game. Signed with an agent who was basically not an agent and who was therefore not certified to do any agent things. Did this.\n27. Bogdan Bogdanovic — His brand will forever be diluted due to the presence on Earth of Bojan Bogdanovic.\n30. Kyle Anderson — Couldn’t outrun a glacier but will probably be fine because the Spurs can turn a toaster into a 10-and-10 guy.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

This update goes into effect 7/10/2017.\nIt has been exciting to see all of the character combinations that players have been using with the release of Spirit of Rebellion! We have been collecting more rules questions and have another update to the Rules Reference document. This is a living document, and we want to make sure that it serves the current needs of the community.\nTwo new errata are added in this update. While we do not expect errata to be a common occurrence moving forward, we feel that it is necessary to make sure that we keep the competitive and casual environments fun and engaging. As such, we have made selections to promote positive game experiences at all levels.\nThe first errata is to the card Ammo Belt. Ammo Belt was too easy to pair with Second Chance, and in many games it could require players to deal massive amounts of damage to win the game. While this has not proven to be a strong combo at a competitive level, it warps more casual games and is difficult to deal with. Ammo Belt is now restricted so that it only works with weapons, which removes the combo and also makes the card more thematic. Anyone who is playing Ammo Belt with cards like Infantry Grenade and Thermal Detonator, interactions that we are happy exist, will find that this errata does not affect them at all.\nThe second errata is to the card Fast Hands. Fast Hands removes some of the inherent interaction in the game by allowing dice to be resolved immediately upon being rolled. While this is an ability that should exist in the game, the cost of 0 has made it too ubiquitous. It is particularly annoying to play against a Poe Dameron / Maz Kanata deck, which has been very popular. Putting a Fast Hands on Poe Dameron meant that control decks could not effectively target Maz Kanata in an effort to control the tempo of the game, as Poe could resolve his dice by himself. As such, we are now limiting Fast Hands to Yellow characters only. This keeps the card viable in a lot of decks but opens up more counter play against Poe Dameron/Maz Kanata decks.\nThere are several other changes worth noting. We have added more information about when shields are used, clarified that each player orders their own simultaneous effects, and made it clear that when a card moves the die always moves with it.\nIf you have any questions about these changes or need something answered that has not been addressed, please fill out the Rules Question form on our website.\nDownload the new Star Wars: Destiny Rules Reference now to read the entire update before it goes into effect on July 10th. If you're planning on playing in a Store Championship, make sure to read the errata so you're prepared!

Thank you for being on this journey with us.\n2016 saw not only Grim Dawn’s release, but also 7 major patches and content updates. It saw the successful release of our Survival Mode, known as the Crucible, content that exists thanks to the generous support of our Kickstarter backers who pushed the campaign well beyond its initial goal and funded several stretch goals.\nModding Tools Released - As promised ages ago, in a different era when virtual dinosaurs still roamed the earth, Grim Dawn would come with modding tools, the same tools used to create the game in fact. And we delivered on this promise shortly after release. Modding now thrives across several websites, including its own subsections of this forum.\nThe Hidden Path - Released with V1.0.0.4, the Hidden Path took you on a journey across Cairn to uncover the hidden route taken by the devout of the three Witch Gods (Bysmiel, Dreeg and Solael). Secrets were unveiled and new mysteries presented themselves as you learned more about the devious Three and their twisted machinations.\nThe Crucible - Released in conjunction with V1.0.0.5, the Crucible DLC introduced a new way to play Grim Dawn as you tackled 150 challenging waves of foes collected from across Cairn, under the cynical gaze of Lokarr the Master of the Crucible. You constructed powerful defenses, made offerings to the celestials to grant you strength and gathered mounds of awesome loot in the process.\nNew Legendary Sets and monster infrequents were scattered across our various updates, adding more variety to the loot hunt. Older items were revised to improve build variety. Overall, more than 40 new items were introduced after the release.\nThe Fall of Valbury - Our most recent content update, V1.0.0.7, introduced a massive new roguelike dungeon for you to explore, filled to the brim with lore, loot and dangerous encounters.\nTech Improvements - From improved skill functionality to fixing bugs and improving multiplayer stability, our post release updates made great strides in giving you a smoother experience with less frustrating bugs, even tracking down some rare issues that have eluded our efforts for a long time. This ongoing process will continue into 2017 and the expansion.\nNew Goodies for Loyalist Owners - With the introduction of the Loyalist Upgrade on Steam, two new Illusions were added for everyone that supported us with a Loyalist Edition purchase through our website. If you own the Loyalist Edition and have not done so already, stop by Kory the Keeper in Devil’s Crossing and claim the latest in stylish headwear!\nTune in to our regular Grim Misadventure updates as we continue to unveil our work on the expansion!\nAs I’m sure the first question on everybody’s mind is just when will you get to experience it all for yourself? We are not quite at a point where we can announce an exact release date, but the current range puts us in Q1/Q2 of 2017. No matter when it releases, you can be sure that it will arrive posthaste.\nLike knowing what is coming up next for Grim Dawn? Check back on 01/23/2017 for our next development update!\nWas expecting the Necromancer but what the heck.\nMysterious Fiend looks like Ugdenbog Spikeshells and is that the G-Man standing next to it? Half Life 3 confirmed!!\nLast edited by Chthon; 01-09-2017 at 05:10 PM.\nit was a good year, now hoping for an even better one with the upcoming DLC!!\nWhatever the 8th mastery may or may not be, would you really think we'd blow our entire load quite so quickly?\nThe anticipation has to build first!\nIt's going to be a 'Harvey the Drifter' mastery.\nDamn, i don't think i have seen him since my first playthrough.\nthanks Zantai and the devz. thought it was just pure 2016 throwback! Looking forward to play more this year with the upcoming expac!\nthose rifles look so good. Also A new costellation? Raised devotion cap??", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Give me 12 steps to make your hair look naturally healthy and beautiful.", "output": "1. Before you get into the shower, grab a brush or a wide toothed comb and start at the ends of your hair. Gently detangle and work your way upward toward your scalp, being careful not to tug or pull on your hair as you go.If you have curly hair, you can wait until after your shower and brush your hair while it’s damp with a wide toothed comb.\n2. Thankfully, you don’t have to take ice cold showers, either! Turn down your water temperature until the water is warm, but not scalding hot. It will help protect your hair and keep it from getting too dry after you wash it.\nThe optimal temperature is below 112 °F (44 °C). If your shower is steaming, it’s probably too hot.\n3. When you’re shopping for shampoo and conditioner, look for bottles that say “silicone- and sulfate-free” on them. They won’t dry out your hair as much, and you’ll keep more of your natural oils on your scalp.\nAlso avoid products with alcohol in them, as that can dry out your hair too.\n4. When you’re in the shower, get your hair wet and put a glob of shampoo into your hands. Rub the shampoo onto your scalp, and use your fingers to gently massage the product into your hair. When you rinse, the shampoo will run down to the ends of your hair and make sure it’s all squeaky clean.Putting shampoo straight onto the ends of your hair can dry them out and cause damage. Plus, the ends of your hair are very rarely dirty or greasy.\nWhile it might feel good, try to avoid the temptation to scratch your scalp with your nails as you shampoo. This can damage your scalp and lead to issues like dandruff and irritation.\n5. When you’re still in the shower, rub a hair mask or a deep conditioner onto the ends of your hair and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Wash the product away before you get out of the shower to give your hair extra moisture and shine.Look for hair masks and deep conditioners with avocado oil, grapeseed oil, or olive oil in them for natural hydration.\nYou can make your own hair mask by combining 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil, and 1/2 cup (120 mL) of honey.\n6. When you get out of the shower, gently squeeze out the excess water and blot your hair with a towel. Wrap it up to get the majority of the water out before you let it air dry.If you’re feeling fancy, try using a microfiber towel instead of a cotton one. They’re gentler and cause less frizz when you dry your hair.\n7. Hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons can really dry out and damage your hair. When you do use them, make sure you spray a heat protectant onto your hair to keep it from getting too damaged.\nTry using no-heat hairstyles, like braiding your hair while it’s wet to create soft waves.\n8. If you love a slick bun or a high ponytail, try to let your hair down every once in a while. If you ever notice that your hair seems dry or brittle, give it a rest from being tied up all the time.Try using a scrunchie instead of a hair band. They’re softer on your hair and they don’t tug as much on your scalp.\n9. Make sure you’re eating plenty of lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and plant oils in moderation. Eggs, spinach, leafy greens, berries, and avocados are particularly good for your hair health.\nIf you want to, you could take a daily multivitamin to make sure you’re getting all the nutrients that you need.\n10. When you go swimming, put on a swim cap and make sure all your hair is tucked tightly underneath. When you get out of the pool, take a quick rinse to avoid drying out your hair with chlorine.If you have blonde hair, it’s especially important to rinse afterwards. Chlorine can turn blonde hair green if it’s left in long enough.\nIf you don't feel like wearing a swim cap, wash your hair with fresh, clean water and conditioner before jumping into the pool. The clean water will act like a barrier and prevent your hair from soaking in any chlorine or salt.\n11. Head to the salon and get a little bit taken off to get rid of split ends and damage. If your hair grows slowly, you could even push it to every 2 months.\nTrims don’t help your hair grow faster, but they do help your ends look fuller and healthier.\n12. When you go to bed, switch out your pillowcase for a silk or satin one to smooth down your locks while you snooze. You can find fairly inexpensive pillowcases online or at most home goods stores.\nSilk pillowcases can also help maintain your natural curls overnight.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "How to tackle my violent 3-year-old niece?\n\nMy 3-year-old niece sometimes behaves very violently. She so much enjoys hitting me with tab/doll/spoon/bottle or whatever she has. She hits very hard. I try to take the things away from her. But she is very stubborn and won't give those items to me. She is very intelligent otherwise. She is very witty and quick to reply. She has very good observation skills.\nSo, unwillingly, I would threaten her with a slap, she still doesn't relent. So I feel a little irritated at my inability to handle such situations. Also, she has a tendency to spoil things. She would tear the newspaper/books. She would keep throwing things away. She is not at all obedient. \nOnce she was hitting me very hard on my head with a water bottle. I tried to take the bottle away but she didn't let me. I tried telling her how it hurts me, she still didn't relent. Then I picked another bottle and hit mildly on her head (not at all out of frustration, just to make her aware that it's not good to hit others. I admit my method was wrong.), but she still kept hitting. \nThen I was about to go out of the room to call her parents when she immediately hit my nephew on the head. I saw that she hit very hard. Immediately, I slapped her on the face. She cried for about 20 minutes. I felt very bad. Now I always keep my room shut so that she doesn't enter. Because she would spoil everything in the room. I really wish somebody could help me how to deal with this situation. I just want her to behave properly. \nI feel very very sad when her mother keeps slapping her daily. I have told her not to slap the child but she wants the kid to obey her. What are the ways to teach such kids, surely slapping is not one of them? Because anyways it's not working.", "output": "When my children were growing up we had several mantras, and one was \"we don't hit\". You really cannot teach a child not to hit by hitting them, nor not to scream by screaming at them etc.\nDealing physically with a hitter is easier when you have been picking them up and holding them your whole life. A toddler can be very strong and squirmy, and you can't be sure how firm you can be without hurting them. Taking thing from them is also hard.\nLearn how to pick her up in a way that makes it hard for her to hurt you. This usually means from behind with your arms around her waist, and holding her reasonably close to you so she doesn't have enough room to kick you really hard. Say to her \"don't hit me! We don't hit.\" The first sentence can be in an agitated or excited tone, but the second should be calm.(You can also say \"I won't let you hurt me\" in a way that reassures her you are protecting her from doing something wrong.) Now walk her somewhere slightly different. Another room, another part of the same room - you're just changing her environment. Put her down, and remind her of your confidence in her. \"I know you can play without hurting me.\" Or perhaps \"it's more fun to play without hurting anyone.\" \nNext, direct her specifically to an activity. \"Would you like to colour now?\" or \"Here are some blocks to build with.\" Toddlers really can't process \"don't X\" very well. They do much better when you tell them what to do instead. If she was hitting for a reason - for example because another child took her toy, or because you gave her something she didn't want - tell her a better way to express her feelings. \"Use your words, not your hands\" is the most common phrasing here.\nAs for the matter of possessions. It's a lot to ask of a toddler that they live surrounded by things that could be broken or ripped, and never touch them. These things don't mean the same to her as to you. She doesn't read the newspaper. Its value to her is how cool it feels when it crumples and rips. Keeping your room closed, and keeping things you don't want her to touch out of her reach, isn't something to feel bad about.

{"input": "What can we do to slow climate change and protect coral reefs?", "output": "Bleaching events have stressed coral worldwide, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, and research says their survival depends on quickly slowing climate change.\nTwo doses of bad news for the world's coral reefs came in the last week. First, Australia's government confirmed that the Great Barrier Reef is in the midst of a second consecutive year of mass bleaching. It's the first time the reef has experienced back-to-back events, and it seems to be weakening many of the corals.\nThen on Wednesday, leading scientists published a new study about last year's bleaching—the worst to date—suggesting that when the seas are hot enough for long enough, nothing can protect coral reefs. Their only hope is that we rapidly slow climate change.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, looked at data from three bleaching events along the 1,400 mile-long Australian reef system dating back to 1998. By looking at factors including water temperature, water quality and fishing protections, the authors determined that last year's bleaching was linked almost exclusively to ocean warming.\nConservationists have long hoped that protecting corals from other threats, such as pollution and overfishing, might help shield at least some of them from bleaching, too. While the new paper doesn't entirely deflate that hope—such protections likely help reefs recover—it shows that such work provides little if any relief from severe bleaching.\n\"At the level of heat stress that was seen during this event, it just didn't matter,\" said C. Mark Eakin, coordinator of the Coral Reef Watch program at NOAA and a co-author of the paper.\nIlsa B. Kuffner, a marine biologist with the United States Geological Survey who was not involved in the research, said the new paper supports a solid body of evidence suggesting that disease and bleaching are driving coral mortality, while other factors play a more important role in the recovery from those threats. \"It's a distinction that, while it's subtle, is also very important when you talk about what's actually causing coral reef decline,\" she said.\nThe paper also found that a reef's history made little difference. Some studies have suggested that previous bleaching may make reefs more resilient if they are given time to recover, perhaps by killing off weaker corals or driving some adaptive response.\nWarmer-than-average temperatures can cause coral to expel the symbiotic algae that live on its surface, turning the reef white. Such bleaching stresses coral and can make it more susceptible to disease and death.\nThe world's reefs are in the midst of what scientists consider to be a single, mass bleaching event dating back to 2014. Climate models project that most of the world's reefs could experience annual bleaching by 2050 without rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile coral can survive even extreme bleaching, surveys conducted this month along the Great Barrier Reef are showing evidence that successive hits take a toll. Eakin said the level of heat stress—a measurement of how hot the waters are for how long—is lower than last year, and yet the bleaching appears to be just as widespread.\n\"They haven't bounced back yet, so when you hit them with another event a year later, you can see more bleaching at a lower level of heat stress,\" he said. \"A lot of the corals that have survived last year really are not ready for another event.\"\nThe bleaching has also spread to areas of the reef that escaped last year's event, according to the recent surveys.\nSuccessive bleaching also appears to be reshaping the makeup of the reef system. Reefs are composed of a rich diversity of coral species, with some particularly sensitive to bleaching and some that recover much more quickly than others. With consecutive years of bleaching, and after four events over 20 years, the new paper said the composition of the reef is changing in areas that have seen recurrent bleaching, perhaps irreversibly.\n\"The good news is you've got some tough corals that are surviving,\" Eakin said. \"The bad news is, one of the most important things about coral reefs is their diversity, and you're cutting out some of that diversity.\"\nThe paper's authors believe that protecting reefs from pollution and overfishing will help them recover from bleaching. But the most important action, they said, lies elsewhere.\n\"Securing a future for coral reefs, including intensively managed ones such as the Great Barrier Reef,\" they wrote, \"ultimately requires urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming.\"\nNicholas Kusnetz is a reporter for InsideClimate News.

I put down the sign and checked. Nope. All good. When I looked up, the car was gone. And it dawned on me why she didn’t stick around for my reply. It was already on my sign.\nI hadn’t taken any communications theory at that point. And I wasn’t skilled in cultural exchange analysis. But I knew that sign had a message. And as messages tend to be, it was aimed at someone.\nSometimes my brain doesn’t work as fast as I’d like, but I realized, looking up, reading the sign, standing on that street in Portland on a Sunday afternoon, that my sign was aimed at women. What women were most likely to physically feel the sign’s message? Women who’d had an abortion. Women stuck between one bad choice and another. Women who were doing the best they knew how in a world that didn’t love them. And certainly didn’t understand.\nI was holding up a sign that was intended to shame people.\nThere is no such thing as an issue. There are only people. Jesus loved people. Even people who could have killed their brothers by sticking them in clothes dryers.\nI want to love people, too.\nThere is no such thing as an issue. There are only people.

In this regard, I would be interested to know differences in use of \"пиар\" and \"пропаганда\" or \"реклама\", and why words with the root \"пиар\" become so popular.", "output": "Пропаганда is about view-of-life, it's not about a person or a company. This could be about something like 'our country is the greatest' or 'to be healthy you need to run 5 miles every day' etc.\nРеклама is advertising - posters on buildings or in the transport, banners in the internet etc. It is obvious that a person or a company paid for that.\nПиар also makes a person or a company more known - but in more subtle way. For instance a person may be known for organizing a music festival, or some special party each Valentine Day etc. So, it is not a straight-forward advertising, but a way to get people's attention. \nЧерный пиар could be some kind of activity to create a negative impression of a person or a company, e.g. there could be a series of articles or mentioning in media that 'they don't spend money on environmental protection' or 'they payed bribes' etc. \n\nПиар is a Russian rendering of PR (пи-ар) acronym, which stands for Public Relations. As far as I know it has a different meaning in Russian than Public Relations in English. Its a professional jargon among people that are a professionals in promotion and advertising. It become popular maybe because it contains the (new to Russian language) idea of organized activity of making company or a person more known to a wide audience. Before only реклама existed, but it does not cover all the required meanings. \nПиар has no negative meaning by itself, but when someone wants to say 'they are not so good as they look, they just want a positive image' they say 'это пиар', or 'они пиарятся на помощи бедным' (they help poor just to have positive image, not because they care about poor people) then пиар has negative meaning of course.\nUsage of пиар can be traced back to 1996 - as you can see it became very popular during last several years. One of the first printed occurrences goes back to 1989: \n\nДелал без причин, иногда даже во вред самому себе, своему, как бы сейчас сказали, «пиару» или «имиджу». [Генрих Боровик. [Послесловие к книге «Дело Кольцова»] (1989)] \n\nI think it is one of the business-related words that become popular in post-USSR times like менеджер, проект, имидж, etc. that can be applied almost to any field of human activity (like art, architecture, technologies, literature and so on and so forth).\n\nActually, if we look on the examples of usage of пиар in 1990-ies, mostly they are connected with political parties. So, actually, at those times пиар (политический пиар) was a synonym for a \"пропаганда\" or \"агитация\" (\"предвыборный пиар\" = \"предвыборная агитация\", \"пиар-команда\" = \"агитаторы\"), but those are Soviet words, so usage of пиар allowed to sound modern.\nHowever even in those times you can find examples like \"после такого пиара клиенты стали обращаться в другой банк\", \"Деревня и райцентр не имеют пиара\",  \"адвокатский пиар, с помощью которого будируется общественное мнение в пользу обвиняемых\".", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "The story of Amanda Duffy, Louisville City Football Club President, and her journey to success in the U.S. sports industry.", "output": "When Amanda Duffy was hired by Louisville City Football Club in October 2014 as its vice president of operations, many who knew of her were excited by the hire. Her history with the United Soccer League (USL), especially within its women’s organization, was well documented and her appointment was seen as somewhat of a coup for the club.\nJust over a year later, Duffy is now the first and only female president of a club in the history of the league. While it is a terrific accomplishment, those who have worked with her or have followed her career were not surprised in the least.\nAfter working with the USL in multiple capacities for seven years, she was hired by Djorn Buchholz, the original general manager of Louisville City FC, to join the developing franchise. However, after the resignation of Buchholz in December of 2014, Duffy took over as the new general manager.\nUnder her guidance, the club rose to prominence in its first season in the league. It finished second not only in the league standings, but also placed only behind Sacramento in attendance for the year.\nFor the ownership of the club, the decision to promote Duffy to president this past November was an easy one.\nThe U.S. sports industry is often viewed as a “boy’s club”, with a small number of women in positions of prominence and exposure. While being one of the few females to have the level of responsibility she now carries, Duffy has shown throughout her life that she can compete with the guys and be comfortable doing so.\nGrowing up in eastern North Carolina, she stated there weren’t a whole lot of club teams to play for—and absolutely none for girls.\n“My first seven years playing soccer was on boys’ teams,” Duffy said.\nA girls’ team was finally created and she played soccer with them through high school before heading to East Carolina University (ECU) to play from 1998-2002. She left her mark on the Pirates’ program as the first women’s soccer player to be elected to the ECU Athletics Hall of Fame (2012), setting numerous records including being the record holder for the most points (83) and the most goals (33) in school history. She is also second all time in assists (17).\nOutside of ECU, Duffy was a two-time, First Team All Conference USA player. She led the conference in goals (14), points (32), and shots (63) in 2001.\nShe stayed at ECU to get her master’s degree, and during that time she worked as a graduate assistant with the women’s team. Concurrently, she began to play with the Carolina Courage, a team in the pro-am Women’s United Soccer Association League.\nOne of the requirements for Duffy’s master’s degree was to complete an internship. She was trying to decide if coaching or administration would be her future in soccer, so it was important to make sure she gained experience in both fields.\n“Having been a grad assistant, I went to the USL to try to get the ‘other side’ of it,” said Duffy.\nShe still wanted to pursue a professional career, and after her internship concluded, she packed her bags and moved to Sweden for a season.\nDuffy then reached out to Tim Holt, an executive with the USL who not only would serve as the league President from 2009-2015, but is considered one of the top soccer executives in the nation. Now as the vice president of development for Orlando City Soccer Club of Major League Soccer (MLS), Holt was so impressed with Duffy during her time as an intern that he created a part-time position just to get her back into the organization.\nHe saw the asset that she was to the league, and is thrilled to see how high she has risen.\nOver the next seven years, Duffy would work in a variety of roles within the USL structure. Oftentimes, she found herself thrust into situations where the organization was going through periods of change and reorganization. For example, in 2009, she was moved to an interim director role of USL 1/USL 2 (the USL’s previous two divisions before the merger following the 2014 season) when the director left about 30 days before the season. She continued her advancement within the organization and, in 2010, was promoted to senior director of the USL W-League (women’s league), a role she would serve in over the next four years until she joined Louisville City.\n“I was on the men’s side in a tumultuous period of time for minor league soccer in the U.S., but learned a tremendous amount,” said Duffy.\nDuffy’s experience during that time helped her as she took over a female professional league that lacked the resources and recognition of the men’s leagues. Also, numerous relationships Duffy established while working with the men’s leagues put her in a position to succeed with the W-League.\nDuffy felt like she was presented with opportunities that gave her the right amount of development for each new position she attained. You have to look no further than her first season with Louisville City for proof of that. Despite taking over less than four months prior to the start of the regular season after the resignation of Buchholz, Duffy dove right into the position and overcame an immense amount of challenges.\n“Things were nearly at ground zero,” she claimed.\nNot only did she succeed in getting the franchise ready in time for its first match, but she impressed almost everyone involved with the club.\nEstopinal added that when Buchholz resigned, there was really no doubt in handing her the general manager position.\nIt wasn’t just those in Louisville who were impressed, although many expected her to be successful as soon as she took over.\n“Her role in leading Louisville City to a successful inaugural season is no surprise to those who have worked with her over the years,” added Holt.\nStay tuned for Pt. 2 of “Amanda Duffy: Louisville City FC Pres Building on First-Year Success”!", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "As a beginner in make cabbage rolls, what are the 35 basic steps I should take?", "output": "1. Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.: Fill a large pot roughly halfway with water and bring it to a boil on the stove over high heat.\n\nThe stockpot should contain enough water to completely cover the head of cabbage. Do not overfill the pot, however, since doing so can cause the water to boil over the side.\nYou do not need to add any salt or oil to the water.\n2. Trim the cabbage.: Cut away as much of the core as you can and remove any torn or ragged outer leaves.\nCut around the core at the bottom of the cabbage head using a small paring knife. Dig as much of the core out as possible. Doing this makes it easier to remove the leaves after the cabbage boils.\n3. Cook the cabbage until soft.: Place the cabbage in the boiling water and cook for roughly 2 minutes.\n\nCarefully dunk the cabbage in and out of the boiling water using tongs or a heat-resistant serving spoon.\nKeep the cabbage core-end-up as it boils.\nThe leaves should soften and start to break free once the cabbage has boiled for a sufficient amount of time.\n4. Pull away 12 large leaves.: Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle with your hands, remove 12 leaves from the outside of the cabbage, keeping them intact as much as possible.\n\nAs long as you cut away a portion of the core before boiling the cabbage, the leaves should practically fall off on their own. If this does not happen, though, you can use a fork or tongs to gently loosen the leaves.\nAs you pull away the leaves, do so gently so that you do not accidentally rip them.\n5. Cut the thick center vein from each leaf.: Use a paring knife to cut a V-shaped cut from the bottom of each leaf around the thick center rib to remove it.\n\nOnly cut out the thickest part of this center rib, located at the bottom of the stem. Do not cut too far into the leaf. If you do, wrapping the leaf around the filling will become difficult.\nThis is only an optional step and is not absolutely essential. If you are uncertain about how much to trim and are anxious about trimming away too much, you could simply skip this step.\n6. Mix the sauce ingredients together.: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Set aside.\nFor a chunkier sauce, you could use an undrained 15-oz (470-ml) can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup (250 ml) of tomato sauce instead of the 15-oz (470-ml) can of tomato sauce.\n7. Combine the ingredients for the meat filling.: Place the ground beef, ground pork, tomato sauce, chopped onion, uncooked rice, parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large mixing bowl and mix the ingredients with your hands until thoroughly combined.\n\nMake sure that your hands are clean before you mix the filling. On a similar note, make sure that you wash your hands with warm water and soap after handling raw meat.\nYou could use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon instead of your hands, but it may be more difficult to combine the ingredients evenly using that technique.\n8. Place even amounts of filling on each cabbage leaf.: Place roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the mixture in each leaf, toward the center bottom.\nIf you cut away a portion of the center vein, place the filling just above the removed portion.\n9. Roll the leaf around the filling.: Beginning from the cut end of the leaf, roll each leaf up and over the filling, tucking the leaf underneath itself to create a tight bundle.\nIf you cut away a portion of the center vein, overlap the cut ends before you begin rolling the leaf up. Otherwise, you may not be able to create an even roll and the filling could start to fall out.\n10. Tuck the ends under.: Fold the open ends of each leaf underneath the bundle to prevent the roll from unraveling.\n\nThe bottom of the roll should be the edge at which you stopped rolling. In other words, no seams should be visible from the “top” of the cabbage roll.\nHold each roll together with a toothpick, if necessary. If the roll comes loose or spills open, re-wrap it and secure the ends in place by spearing the roll with a toothpick.\n11. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).: Bring out a large Dutch oven or roasting pan for the cabbage rolls.\nA Dutch oven or roasting pan is ideal because of the size and weight of the pan, but you could also use a casserole dish or large baking dish in a pinch.\n12. Spread 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sauce on the bottom of the Dutch oven.: Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.\nThe sauce helps to prevent the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the pan. As such, you do not need to use aluminum foil or cooking spray.\n13. Arrange the cabbage rolls over the sauce.: Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.\n\nThe cabbage rolls will likely fit into the pan rather snugly, but that is not a problem. If anything, the snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they bake.\nIt is, however, important that the rolls be kept on a single layer. If not, they may not cook evenly.\n14. Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls.: Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.\nIf necessary, use a spoon or spatula to spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll. Some of the sauce can also slide down into the spaces between the rolls.\n15. Bake for 60 to 90 minutes.: Cover the pan and bake the rolls until become tender.\n\nCheck the cabbage rolls after the first 60 minutes. If the cabbage leaves still do not feel tender, continue baking for the additional 30 minutes.\nMake sure that the cover you are using is oven-safe. This is especially important if you are using a baking pan instead of a Dutch oven. If you do not have a lid, cover the pan with aluminum foil.\n16. Serve hot out of the oven.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the oven. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n17. Spread 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sauce on the bottom of a Dutch oven.: Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.\nThe sauce partially prevents the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the Dutch oven. As a result, you do not need to use cooking spray.\n18. Arrange the cabbage rolls over the sauce.: Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.\n\nThe cabbage rolls will fit into the Dutch oven rather snugly. This snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they cook.\nIt is important, however, to keep the cabbage rolls in a single layer inside the Dutch oven. If not, they may not cook evenly.\n19. Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls.: Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.\nIf necessary, spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula. Some of the sauce should also slide down into the gaps between the cabbage rolls.\n20. Cook on low heat for 45 to 60 minutes.: Cover the pan and cook on the lowest heat possible until the rolls become tender.\nIf you cook the cabbage rolls at too high a heat or for too long, the bottoms may burn and stick to the Dutch oven.\n21. Serve hot.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the stove. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n22. Arrange the cabbage rolls in your slow cooker.: Place the rolls in your slow cooker, seam-side-down, packing them in tightly and in even layers.\nIdeally, the cabbage rolls should be packed into a single layer. This is not always possible with a slow cooker, though, and not even essential. Since the majority of the cooking depends on the steam and heat built up inside the slow cooker as it cooks, the rolls do not need to be packed into one layer to cook evenly.\n23. Pour the sauce over the rolls.: Evenly spread the sauce out over the contents of the slow cooker.\n\nSpread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula.\nMake sure that some of the sauce seeps into the cracks and crevices between the cabbage rolls. This is especially important if some of the cabbage rolls are layered on top of others.\n24. Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.: Cover the slow cooker and cook the cabbage rolls until tender.\n\nDo not remove the cover from the slow cooker at any point during the cooking process.\nIf you are running a bit short on time, cook the cabbage rolls on High for about 4 hours.\n25. Serve hot.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the slow cooker. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n26. Prepare the cabbage leaves.: Remove and wash the leaves. Place them in the freezer to freeze. Layer them on a baking sheet before placing in the freezer.\n27. Remove the leaves from the freezer.: Allow to thaw.\n28. Tear off a large piece of kitchen foil.: Place on a large baking tray or dish. Line this with an equally large piece of parchment paper. You will be placing the thawed leaves onto the parchment paper sitting on top of the foil.\nBoth the foil and the parchment need to be long; you will be picking up the edges to wrap over the finished cabbage ball, so leave plenty of room for movement.\n29. Place four leaves onto the foil/parchment paper combination.: Place the leaves crisscross from one another.\n30. Layer the filling of choice onto these four leaves.: The filling could be hamburger mince with cooked rice (brown or white), some spices and seasonings, garlic and an egg to bind it all together. A vegetarian version could be made using mince analog, a grain, mashed beans or hydrated TVP in place of the hamburger mince (egg optional).\n31. Continue layering the leaves four at a time.: Add the filling after each layer of leaves. When all of the leaves from the entire cabbage have been used and the stuffing is in each layer, the ball is completed.\n32. Roll the layers of stuffed cabbage leaves up with the foil and parchment.: The aim is to create a large boil; don't be surprised at the large shape––this can easily be as large as a basketball.\n33. Place in the oven, sitting on a baking sheet with edges or inside a baking dish.: Bake at 350ºF/180ºC for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Check to see how it is baking now and then; wear oven mitts as it will be hot to hold.\n34. Remove from the oven when baked.: Remove from the oven when baked.\n35. Serve whole.: Place on a serving plate and add to a buffet or potluck table. Provide a knife for cutting slices; the idea is to cut large layers in a circle, just like a round cake. At least 12 large slices will be available.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the potential implications of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger.", "output": "Despite having more than 50 million customers, Sprint’s network coverage has always kind of been a joke. But just recently, in a somewhat surprising move, Sprint showed us just how bad its LTE coverage actually is in a single, eye-opening infographic.\nNormally, Sprint wouldn’t share something this damning. But the company is hoping that by comparing its network coverage against Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, it can prove to any pesky regulators that its proposed $26.5 billion merger with T-Mobile won’t cause a significant decrease in competition among wireless carriers.\nIf you compare Sprint’s LTE coverage maps above to what you’d find on the company’s own website, it’s clear there’s a huge gap between the kind of coverage customers might assume they’re getting and what Sprint actually delivers.\nEven if you concede that much of the difference between the two can be attributed to the size of Sprint’s overall network versus just its LTE coverage, all that yellow painted across the U.S. is at best more than a little misleading.\nUnfortunately, barring some sort of divine intervention, the T-Mo/Sprint merger will probably get approved, which will leave us with three major carriers instead of four. That means the U.S. will be in a similar situation to Canada, which is dominated by three providers: Rogers, Bell, and Telus.\nDespite Sprint’s comparably poor LTE coverage, this merger is still something that should strike a little fear into every cell phone user, as our neighbors to the north suffer from some of the highest phone bills in the developed world.\nCurrently, the Sprint/T-Mo merger is going through a final round of comments that ends shortly on October 9.

Então concluí que “Antártida” está errada.\nO polo norte fica na região “ÁRTICA”, então o polo sul fica na região\nanti, contrária, oposta a região ártica, ou seja, anti+ártica =\nANTÁRTICA.\nConclusão: antártiDa é um erro.\nDo artigo mesmo, lê-se em inglês ARTIC e ANTARTIC, em muitos\ndicionários apresentam o latim ARCTICUS e ANTARCTICUS, em francês\nARCTIQUE e ANTARCTIQUE, em grego ÁRKTIKÓS e ANTÁRKTIKÓS.

Mas não sou eu quem dita o uso das palavras e \"Antártida\" é o que se ouve e o que se lê nos meios de comunicação e nos livros.\nO adjetivo, no entanto, continua sendo \"antártico(a)\" como em \"o continente antártico\".\n\nO topônimo Antártica tem sua origem no latim tardio antarctĭcus que, por sua vez, deriva do grego antigo ανταρκτικός, que significa, literalmente, \"oposto ao Ártico\" (antiártico). Todavia, convencionalmente adotou-se a forma Antártida, tanto em Portugal como no Brasil, mesmo que contraditória quanto à origem etimológica do topônimo. Uma explicação possível seria a analogia com a mítica Atlântida, algo que ocorre da mesma forma em castelhano, em que também convivem as duas formas, Antártida e Antártica, sendo a primeira de uso mais difundido. Na língua italiana, por sua vez, existe apenas o registro de Antartide, também cunhada sobre o modelo de Atlantide (Atlântida).\n\nEm Portugal, antes do Acordo Ortográfico de 1990, a única forma dicionarizada era Antárctida, tomando então o adjetivo a forma antárctico/antárctica (substantivado em [Oceano] Antárctico).\n\nNo Brasil, a forma convencional era Antártida até meados da década de 1970, quando a forma Antártica passou a ganhar força após ser usada em obras acadêmicas sobre o continente, como o livro Rumo à Antártica da geógrafa Teresinha de Castro, publicado em 1976.    - - From Wikipedia", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to convert to christianity. Can you provide 17 detailed steps?", "output": "So you've been thinking, beginning to believe in Jesus Christ as your savior, and you want to convert to Christianity. These are a few steps to help you learn how to convert to the religion.\n1. You might go to a large evangelical meeting in a stadium or a small group Bible study. The size does not matter for where the Spirit of God is presented/manifested: there you'll find the love, joy and peace of God that can satisfy the seeker's soul. Seek first the will of God and all His provisions can freely be yours on your life's path and at The Judgment. If one place does not have really receptive and welcoming followers of Jesus, you need to find a happier group of believers at another meeting place. Try different Christian meetings, churches in your area, and see how you feel.\n2. Conversion is a venture in which you may start out with one congregation or a home Bible study group, and then decide to go to another.\n3. A Bible is a universal book you can find in many places. A Bible contains both the \"Old Testament,\" Jewish/Hebrew books or law, foretelling of Jesus, and of prophetic scriptures -- and the \"New Testament,\" Christian scriptures together.\n\n\"The New Testament\" is what you'll want to read to understand Jesus Christ and Christianity. Its first four books are a day-by-day report in the actual words and teachings of Jesus (the books of \"Matthew\", \"Mark\", \"Luke\" and \"John\", written by those four of his disciples) depicting the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and presenting great teachings by Him and several other of his disciples, especially of St. Paul, who explained the essentials of Christianity in great detail.\nYou will learn about love, hope, salvation by grace through faith, and doing good works appointed to you, but realizing that works do not buy grace which is free (a gift of God), and forgiving the wrongs of others, helping the needy/least of God's children, and much more.\nAs you read, there may be times when you become unsure or confused. If so, you can ask believers about scriptures, including teachers, priests, pastors, and search the Bible online or in Christian books. Just keep in mind that some teachings differ among different denominations, so at times, you may receive differing \"answers\" to your questions. Keep in mind that Satan is the author of confusion, but God is the author of mercy, grace and peace (choose God's way of grace). God's grace is beyond understanding, but it is all sufficient.\nThe most popular English Bible for Protestants for over 400 years has been the King James Bible. Does that translation sound like Elizabethan/Shakespearean English, well that's simply that the early, modern English \"thee, thou, thy, thine, hence, thence, whence, comets, ghost, etc.\" are from that time period. It is important to consider that English speaking Roman Catholics use the Douay-Rheims Bible (with Apocrypha), also from about 1600. \n\nWhereas, Protestants use Bibles with only 66 books (omitting the Apocrypha by excluding several Jewish writings, of chapters and books of obscure origins such as Esdras and Maccabees, etc.).\n4. Find sermons online on the Internet that are inspiring and lead to a deeper, daily walk with Jesus Christ. Scholarly preaching is not what the new believer can get much from. You need the simple, milk of the word of God, before you will need the meat of doctrine or religious opinion...\n5. Converting to Christianity is based on your belief that Jesus is God's only begotten Son, and that He does all manner of miracles including Salvation. Christianity starts with being saved, trusting Christ to save you, and then entails living a good and godly life that is pleasing to God. Both are important.\n6. This means that you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again. Since he paid for your sins you can be forgiven, and because he rose again He has power to give you eternal life. Believing this message you respond, \"Lord Jesus, I believe you died for my sins and rose again, so now please save me, a sinner.\" That saves you and begins your Christian life. Continue to believe.\nA key passage describing salvation is Romans 10:9-10, \"That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the heart (core being) man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\" Such belief is called faith and leads to God freely giving you the gift of salvation by grace through faith not by work or great deeds.Romans 10:9-10\"\n7. Become Baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\n8. Receive Baptism and Holy Communion, rites that some churches call Ordinances, and which other churches call part of the Sacraments.\n9. you might not have a local church, pastor or be able to get baptized, because maybe you are in a country that does not contain any churches or not many priests, pastors, (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Libya,...). Be sure that your relationship with Jesus is not based on formalities, such as baptizing but is based on your personal belief in Him, following Him (and His teachings). Yes, be baptized by another believer, if you can, but the most important baptism for a Christian is his spiritual baptism into Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:27).\n10. Christianity is about God's love, so start showing His love that you received freely, to others such as being willing to forgive everyone and anyone who has wronged you. Jesus said, \"You have heard, 'Love your neighbor', but I say to you, 'Love your enemy, and do good to those who hate you and spitefully use you.' \". We may try to fail miserably -- but God's supply of grace is sufficient, in His boundless mercy, as the grace of God is the power of God unto salvation, not by work, lest any boast. How can anyone afford to reject such great salvation, so rich, and yet so free.\nDo good deeds because you believe in God and are a Christian. \"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. \" Titus 3:8; \"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\" 2 Timothy 3:17. Jesus Christ has said, \"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12.\nFulfill Jesus' commission (Matthew 10:7-8) by going out and preaching the Gospel and healing the sick.\n11. Always pray, remaining in a spirit of prayer in every circumstance, even if to say only, \"Thank you Lord.\" Also, in all things, glorify God by how you live your life.\n12. A good way to examine beliefs of a church is to read the particular church's Statement of Faith, a list of basic beliefs and compare it to others.\n\nThere are many Christian denominations, including Anglican, Assembly of God (and other Pentecostal denominations), Baptist, Christian (denomination), Churches of Christ, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox (Eastern, Greek, Russian), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and United Church of Christ. There are other Protestant groups, with some called \"nondenominational\", \"not affiliated with (____)\" or \"independent (____)\" churches of one kind or another.\n\nAlthough all Christians share belief in Jesus Christ, each denomination has its own unique emphases on certain teachings, traditions, customs, and beliefs. Different groups form consensus on understandings of different doctrines about The Sacraments, The Triune God (versus Arian Belief concerning God), pastor, order of services, offices of bishop, presbyter, deacon, and such, marriage, healing, prophesies, praying to saints, speaking unknown tongues, formalities, rituals, written prayers, or informality, pray as the Spirit of God gives utterance, etc.\nIt is wise to research organizations very carefully and thoroughly before you get involved with them too deeply. Some people have had negative experiences because they rushed into a group too quickly before finding out all about it. Don't let yourself be rushed into a commitment to a group until you feel comfortable. Beware falling under the sway of religious cult leaders who won't respect your right to make your own decisions or who try to control your life in a manipulative manner.\n13. They may help you find all the answers to the questions you need to know.\n14. Find a church near you, or one that you like. Go to that church and talk to the pastor or priest, attend church services or mass whenever you can, and visit this Church any day of the week that your soul calls you to.\n15. \"I am sorry for my sin, all my wrong doing; I want to be new, and I truly thank you for everything and that I am now forgiven and saved from the penalty for my sins as a free gift of Your Holy Spirit, in Jesus' name.\"\n16. going to Christian meetings, being baptised as a sign of repentance, praying to God, reading the Bible, taking communion (\"The Lord's Supper\"), and showing God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, to fellowship with believers -- and when thinking that you have un-confessed sin, confess and repent asking for, and accepting, forgiveness, expecting consequences for some wrongs and going on, all in Christ Jesus' name -- with God as the one, true Judge of all things good or bad.\n17. The Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.\nMany churches have somewhat different confessions of faith and/or catechisms that are based upon their own interpretation of the Christian creeds, Holy Ordinances, system of church organization, and other matters. See, for example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Formula of Concord, the Westminster Confession, the Anglican 39 Articles, the 1689 Baptist Confession, the 1919 Doctrinal Statement of the World Conference on Christian Fundamentals, and others.

And many of them were teens.\nThe result is addictive — and, for educators, an enormous distraction.\nIn Missouri, a science teacher and coach has started confiscating smartphones from students caught playing Fortnite in class. Administrators at one British school sent a text urging parents to banish the game, saying it is \"unsuitable for Primary pupils and needs to be banned at home,\" according to The Sun newspaper.\nMaker Epic Games is aware of the problems. The company added a warning to the game's loading screen asking students not to play during class.\nFortnite started as a cooperative game where players team together to fend off a zombie apocalypse sparked by a world-ending storm. In September, Cary, N.C.-based Epic launched Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play version featuring the popular game style battle royale, which essentially puts a contest like The Hunger Games into a video game.\nBy late March it was the top-selling iPhone app in the United States, the United Kingdom and 11 other countries, according to PC Games News.\nIt's attracted some high-profile players, adding to the buzz. A recent match pitted the rappers Drake and Travis Scott against JuJu Smith-Schuster, a wide receiver with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Tyler Blevins, a professional gamer who goes by the username “Ninja.” More than 600,000 viewers followed the match on live-streaming website Twitch.com, a record.\nThe game’s only boundary is age — it is played by young people, almost exclusively.\nChristian Nole was one of 15 people who gathered at the Gamers Paradise video arcade in River Vale, N.J. on a Friday afternoon for a Fortnite tournament. The top prize: $100 cash for the player with the most kills.\nContestants included Evan Vomero, 18, a senior who plays video games competitively for prize money.\nAnother contestant was Roman Parrotta, 11, a sixth-grader from Tappan, New York.\nWatching a Fortnite game for the first time is a disorienting experience. Shootouts come in quick bursts and end in seconds. The entire world spins, jerks and zooms with the slightest twitch of the player’s thumb on the controller.\nAfter an hour, the game comes into focus. Yes, Fortnite occupies a post-apocalyptic world in which a storm has killed 98% of the earth's population, leaving those who remain to kill zombies or one another other, depending on which mode one chooses to play. It is a violent free-for-all in which 100 players board a flying blue school bus suspended from a hot air balloon (not important, don’t ask), skydive onto an island, scavenge for weapons, build forts for protection, and kill anyone they encounter.\nThe last one standing wins. It all sounds pretty grim.\nAfter one’s eyes acclimate, however, Fortnite reveals itself to be playful, even lovely. Avatars resemble cartoon characters. Cars are rendered in exaggerated form, like a Hot Wheels set. Players can dress up in pink bunny suits, ride rockets, and bash buildings to bits swinging a rainbow-colored battle ax shaped like a unicorn’s head.\nIn the countryside, players splash through steel-blue streams. They hunt each other through tall grass that curls in the wind.\nFor Mulvaney, Fortnite became a compulsion. In March, he said, he played it every moment he could.

{"input": "\"Paragraph: \"Amid ongoing protests in Ferguson, Mo., the national conversation about racial justice and police force has ignored a critical point that needs to be discussed, said Fox News pundit Juan Williams Civil rights activists and black leaders have failed to address the very thing that’s fueling conservative, white backlash — the high crime rate among the black community, particularly among young black men, Williams said on Aug. 24th’s Fox News Sunday. \"\"I think there’s fear of intimidation, harassment being legitimized by the fact that there is a high rate of crime, especially among young black men,\"\" Williams said. \"\"No. 1 cause of death, young black men 15 to 34 — murder. Who’s committing the murder? Not police. Other black men.\"\" Last year, PolitiFact found that 93 percent of murder victims were killed by someone who shares their race. This time, we want to check out Williams’ claim that homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old. Unnatural causes We looked at numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists the leading causes of death across all demographics. Experts said that CDC data, compiled from coroner reports, are in line with FBI numbers, sourced from police reports. The CDC does not distinguish between the types of homicide (criminal, justified, etc.) or the types of accidents (auto accidents, falls, firearm discharge, etc.). The numbers for 2011, the most recent CDC findings, are consistent with data from previous years. According to the CDC, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011. Accidents ranked second in causes of death, and suicide claimed the third amount of black male lives between 15 and 24 years old, while heart disease ranked third for men 24-34. Leading causes of death among black males 1st 2nd 3rd All ages Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 1-4 Accidents Homicide Congenital malformations 5-14 Accidents Malignant neoplasms Homicide 15-24 Homicide Accidents Suicide 25-34 Homicide Accidents Diseases of the heart 35-44 Diseases of the heart Accidents Homicide 45-54 Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Accidents 55-84 Malignant neoplasms Diseases of the heart Cerebrovascular diseases 84-older Diseases of the heart Malignant neoplasms Cerebrovascular diseases Source: CDC Compared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of African-American males 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of white males who died. Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered. In 2011, black males 15-34 were 10 times more likely to die of murder than whites of the same age group. Sources: CDC, PunditFact calculations For men of all ages, homicide was ranked fifth in leading causes of deaths for blacks (4.6 percent), seventh for Hispanics (2.8 percent), and ninth for American Indians (2.3 percent). Homicide was not one of the top 15 causes of death for whites 15-34. Color lines Why are so many young black males dying from homicide? As the laws of aging go, younger men are less prone to fall victim to natural causes of death, so they are more likely to die of unnatural causes. And the racial disparity between those causes has partially to do with the likelihood of getting into car-related accidents, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. \"\"Suburban whites drive more than urban blacks, and putting in more miles on highways —  that’s important because not a lot of people are going to get killed in fender benders in neighborhood streets,\"\" Fox said. \"\"There are relatively few auto-accidents in black urban areas.\"\" Beyond driving habits, the criminal homicide rate among young black males is significantly higher than other groups. This, experts agreed, has to do with poverty and geography. The difference in social structures, access to jobs, educational opportunities, and many other factors between impoverished black neighborhoods and others is often a matter of life and death, according to Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"\"The (homicide) numbers highlight the condition in minority areas, where a lot of violence occurs and the whole way of life is further intensified because police surveillance is always trying to track down people,\"\" he said. \"\"People have heightened survival instincts, will do anything to survive, and they’ll seek retribution for anything...because they don’t trust law enforcement.\"\" Though it is tempting to pinpoint one cause as more impactful than others, Silverman cautions against singling out poverty or drugs or any other factor as the cause, because all of them intermix and interact. Our ruling Williams said that the No. 1 cause of death for black men 15-34 years old is murder. CDC data supports the claim. Out of all causes of death, homicide claimed about 40 percent of black lives between 15 and 34 years.

It has a thick body and slightly upturned, pointed snout. Adult coloration is extremely variable and may be mostly yellow, tan, olive, brown, gray, orange, or reddish-brown with dark brown or black large, irregular shaped blotches on the back and smaller blotches on the sides. Some individuals may be entirely black or dark gray without any pattern. The belly may be yellow, light gray, or pinkish and may or may not be mottled gray or greenish. The underside of the tail is lighter than the rest of the belly. There is a dark line extending from the upper jaw through the eye. The scales are keeled, and there are 23-25 dorsal scale rows at midbody. The pupil is round.\nRange: It is found throughout Florida, excluding the Keys. Outside of Florida, it is found throughout the eastern US from Florida and Texas north to Minnesota, east to southern Ontario and Quebec and southern New Hampshire.\nHabitat: It locally abundant in certain habitats including sandhills, scrub, high pine and turkey oak woodlands, hardwood hammocks, meadows, and cultivated fields.\nHeterodon means \"different tooth,\" which refers to the enlarged teeth on the rear of the upper jaw. These teeth inject a mild venom into its prey, and also serve to pop inflated toads like a balloon to enable swallowing. They use their blunt nose to search through leaf litter and soil for prey.\nAdults mainly eat toads, but will sometimes eat other frogs, insects, and invertebrates. Juveniles eat small frogs and toads, insects, lizards, and small snakes.\nIt lays eggs. Breeding takes place in both the spring and fall. Males often follow the female around for several days prior to courtship and copulation. They lay between 4-61 whitish, thin shelled, leathery eggs 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) long. Eggs are deposited in a moist sandy, shallow hole, or under debris, and hatch in 39-65 days. Hatchlings are 6.5-9.5 inches (16-24 cm).\nThe Hognose Snake is renowned for its \"death feigning\" behavior. When threatened, it flattens its head and neck and hisses loudly. It may strike, but only with its mouth closed. If it is further harassed, it will flip on its back and convulse for a short period and may defecate and regurgitate its food. It will then remain motionless with its belly up, mouth open, and tongue hanging out. It may play dead for several minutes before cautiously turning over, looking around to see if it is safe before crawling away.\nFlattening its head and hissing when it is frightened gave rise to two of the local names used for this snake. Florida crackers (native Floridians) call the banded form of the Hognose Snake a \"Puff Adder\" and correctly believe it to be harmless. However, the black form of the Hognose Snake is called a \"Spreading Adder\" and is wrongly believed to be deadly. Both color forms of the Eastern Hognose Snake are harmless to humans. However, humans that are allergic to its small amount of venom have been known to produce local swelling, but no human death has ever occurred.\nAnother old myth says that the Hognose Snake can mix venom with its breath and is thus able to kill a person from a distance of twenty-five feet. In truth, its breath is harmless.\nComparison with other species: The Southern Hognose Snake (Heterodon simus) has a light-colored belly and underside of the tail, and a more upturned snout. Hognose Snakes are often confused with the Pigmy Rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius), which has a blunt nose — it is easy to distinguish between the harmless Hognose Snakes and the Pigmy Rattlesnake.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

He did like his job but, as we all know, sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something. They don't know exactly what they should do, what to change - buy a new pair of shoes or maybe do something more - move to a different city or even to a foreign country. Michael had exactly the same problem.\nOne day, he woke up much earlier than usual. He made a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news. He sat on the sofa in front of the television and, suddenly, he realised  that every morning was exactly the same, nothing had changed for so many years! \"I can't stand it any longer\" - he thought. But what to do? A crazy idea came to his mind.\nSince Michael was a child he had always dreamt of moving to Australia, where he could go kitesurfing  all day long, meet open-minded people, chill on a sandy beach and drink  good Australian alcohol.\n\"Why shouldn't I give myself a chance to make my dreams come true? People have only one life, not more!\"\nAt that moment, he was pretty sure what to do now. He took a sheet of paper and a pen and started to write. After 10 minutes, a resignation letter was ready to take  to Michael's boss. He arrived at the company as quickly as the crowded London streets allowed him.\n\"I need to talk to the boss\" - he said to Jane, the main secretary of the company. Without waiting for her answer, he just went into the office, gave  Mike, his boss for 10 years, an envelope with the resignation letter and left. It all took about 3 minutes.

{"input": "What's the story with the house in Crest Circle Drive? Respond in 38 sentences.", "output": "UPDATED 4 p.m. SATURDAY, FEB. 1: In a bizarre twist, the Hays County Sheriff’s Office now says they found the body of a dead man in a Crest Circle Drive house yesterday evening following a five-hour standoff.\nSgt. Phillip Taylor, the sheriff’s spokesperson, led reporters at the scene to believe that officers found no one inside the home, saying the scene was secure and the incident was being treated as a burglary investigation. Multiple news organizations, including the San Marcos Mercury and the San Marcos Daily Record, reported Friday evening and this morning that SWAT found no one inside the house following the standoff.\n9:31 p.m. JAN. 31: Scores of law enforcement officers swarmed the South Ridge Estates neighborhood southeast of San Marcos on Friday afternoon after a homeowner told police that he thought intruders were barricaded in his house.\nAfter five hours spent attempting to convince the alleged burglars to surrender, however, officers led by Hays County SWAT entered the house at about 7:30 p.m. and found no one inside.\nInvestigators are not yet prepared to say if the homeowner was mistaken about the intruders or if they escaped during the six minutes that lapsed between the initial emergency phone call and the first officer’s arrival, Hays County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Phillip Taylor told the San Marcos Mercury at the scene. The homeowner reported the burglary at 2:27 p.m. and the first deputy arrived at 2:33 p.m., Taylor said.\nTaylor said he was not sure if the homeowner told police that he saw intruders inside his home or only that he heard them.\nPolice from at least four local agencies poured into the area, cordoning off streets and besieging the house in the 800 block of Crest Circle Drive. At one point, more than 40 cops inundated the neighborhood with officers from the San Marcos Police Department, Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office and New Braunfels Police Department joining those from the Hays County Sheriff’s Office.\nThe Hays County Crisis Negotiation Team attempted to contact the intruders using a loudspeaker and then a closed-circuit telephone slipped inside. When that didn’t work, officers sent in a remote-controlled robot equipped with cameras to look for signs of the barricaded suspects and then flooded the home with tear gas in an attempt to flush them out.\nShortly after dark, officers entered the home and searched, but found no one hiding inside.\nCORRECTION: This story originally said a closed-circuit telephone was thrown through a window. It was set inside through a door. Also, the house is in South Ridge Estates, not the Ridgecrest neighborhood.\nit happened in South Ridge Estates, not Ridge Crest.\nLMAO! How much did that cost taxpayers?!\nAfter posting the update, readers on Facebook are asking what the hell really happened. We’re working to find out but it’s hard to say at this point.\nWhat I’m gathering — but who knows given the wholesale dissembling going on — is that homeowner comes home, finds his door dead bolted from the inside, fires gun into house. SWAT arrives, doesn’t know if intruder is dead or if there is more than one intruder. Standoff ensues. SWAT enters and finds dead man.\nFor whatever reason, someone instructs the sheriff office’s spokesperson not to say anything about the dead man. Spokesperson follows orders, implying that SWAT finds nothing through a series of misleading statements which I am working on transcribing and publishing.\nLike I said, that’s just me trying to surmise a coherent storyline given what we’re being told. The spokesperson won’t even say if the homeowner is believed to have shot the man or if he was shot at some point later. And the spokesperson, of course, is really just telling media what he is being instructed to tell media — and sacrificing a lot of precious credibility in the process. Both his own and that of Hays County Sheriff Gary Cutler.\nit’s about 2 miles past Hays county line.\nIt all sounds suspicious. I suspect a connection between the parties.\nThe Hays Guadalupe county line goes right through the middle of that subdivision. Google maps doesn’t show the county line but you can see if you look at the maps on the Hays CAD website.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "How to achieve happiness?", "output": "1. If you do something nice for someone else, it is likely to make you feel happier about yourself.  Getting outside of yourself is a great way to alleviate your own suffering. \n\nTry to do one act of kindness every day. It could be something small – say, a compliment or helping someone at work with a project when you don’t have to. If could be how you speak to someone. Or it could be a bigger effort, like helping out a friend or stranger in need.\nWhen you do kind things to others, they will acknowledge the goodness in you, which is bound to make you feel happier. You could make it a habit to make the first email you write every day be one that thanks or praises someone else. This will start out your day with a positive feeling.\nThe ancient philosopher Aristotle believed that to be happy a person needed to live a life of virtue. By virtue he meant showing such attributes as courage, generosity, and wisdom.  How can you achieve these virtues? By acting out on them. Be generous to another person, for example, by sharing your time, your intellect, your care, or your money.\n2. Smiles are truly contagious. When you smile, you feel happier inside. It’s hard not to! And when you smile a lot, people will respond to you more positively, which will make you feel better.\n\nEven if you don’t feel like smiling, just force it at first.  Smiling releases endorphins in the body that will elevate your mood.\nLaughter is another way to feel happy. Find the humor in life. Watch a funny movie. Read some jokes online. People’s sense of humor varies. Figure out what you find funny, and absorb yourself in more of it.\n3. It sounds simple but it’s true. The old saying that you can look at a glass half full or half empty makes a lot of sense. So never forget the positives in your own life or how much worse you could have it.\n\nYou could make a list of all of the positives in your life. Write down everything you can think of. Tape it to the refrigerator so you see it every day. Or you could keep a journal that contains only positive experiences. A great way to focus on the positives? Imagine your life without the things you have. What would it be like if you didn’t have your house? Your spouse? Your job? \n\nHelp someone in need who has it worse than you in some way (volunteer at a homeless shelter; help an elderly shut-in).  This is a good thing to do but should also help you remember that it can always be worse.\nTry not to constantly compare yourself to others. Don’t worry about the friend with the bigger house, or the co-worker who got a better job somewhere else. Focus on yourself.  Chasing money is unlikely to create long-term happiness.\n4. Research has shown that happiness is contagious. That means that people are happier if they are around happy people. If you're always around misery (including on the job), it's a recipe for unhappiness.\n\nResearchers even found that a person’s happiness can affect the friends of friends of friends. The basic point is that social networks matter. So befriend and spend time with people who are happy.\nThat doesn’t mean you ignore friends who are going through a hard time. It just means you shouldn’t only have friends who are miserable or constantly in turmoil.\n5. Meditation will provide a sense of calm and reflection into what can otherwise be an excessively busy life. Many people feel like they never have time to pause and be grateful. If you take that time, it's going to make your life more centered, and happiness will follow.\n\nMeditation means you find some quiet space every day to think and remove outside distractions from your life. What form this takes can be individual; for example, sitting on a sunny deck. Jogging. Going for a quiet walk. Listening to music. \n\nMeditation teaches the brain to focus. If you focus the brain, you will eliminate distractions that can cause a great deal of stress. And stress is a common cause of unhappiness.  If you’re a religious person, pray.\n6. Don’t forget all of the senses. The sense of smell can actually trigger good emotions and moods. So don’t forget to smell.\n\nWhat smells good to you? Figure that out and smell more of it. Smell your favorite flower. Sniff coffee or food that smells good to you. Maybe you love the smell of a certain fragrance. Stimulate the emotions in a positive way.\nYou could also activate the sense of hearing by playing high-energy music that lifts up your mood. Everyone’s tastes are different. Choose peppy songs that are inspiring or energetic. Avoid any music with negative or sad connotations.\n7. Do things you love and love what you do. Choose an occupation that moves you and that you enjoy. If you’re stuck in an occupational rut, find a way to change your circumstances.\n\nTry not to get too sucked into consumer culture. It’s not a strong foundation upon which to build happiness.\nSome philosophers have argued that once people’s basic needs are met, they become more interested in things like achievement, freedom of expression, and other intangible concepts.\nBeing part of something bigger than yourself can make you a lot happier.\n8. Letting go of anger – we all harbor some of it – can be extremely difficult to do. But if you hold onto old grievances, you’re bound to only hurt yourself in the end. \n\nTry as much as possible to focus on the future, and learn from the past rather than dwell in it. You may need help from a religious leader or from a counselor to let go of deep traumas. However, learning to forgive and to let go of anger is mostly about you – not the person you need to forgive.\nSeek reconciliation in situations where it might be possible, even if that means you have to take the high road when you think you’re the one wronged. It will make you feel better inside to be the generous one. Recognize that no one is perfect, most people have their own version of the story, and everyone’s an imperfect human being at the end of the day.\n9. There’s no question about it. Exercise is good for more than your muscles. It’s also going to release adrenaline into the body, which is a natural mood lifter. \n\nIf you exercise regularly, you will also be physically healthier and look fitter, which should lead to a better mood. How could it not!\nYou might meet people at the workout gym, increasing your social network. Or you could exercise outside. This way you will also get the warming rays of the sun (if you live in a warm enough climate). The sun has healing powers. Get out of a gloomy dark house for awhile and you will see an immediate mood lift!\n10. Make an honest assessment of your life. What’s not making your happiness stronger? Are there things in your life that are negative patterns that you just keep repeating?\n\nAssess what aspects of your life add to your life in positive ways, and which detract. And then set out to remove the aspects that detract. Ask a friend or relative for their assessment, and see if they match yours.\nFigure out the causes of unhappiness and to what degree you are playing a role in your own problems.  What would it take to make your life happy? What life do you want? Write it down.\n11. You need to have a strong idea of who you are and your own self worth to be happy. If you don’t have those things, you need to work on them with a therapist or just by starting to recognize your own worth.\n\nBe happy with yourself. Never change who you are for anybody; discover what you like and dislike, and figure out what you believe in and what issues are of little importance to you. This will help you discover who you really are. Then be proud to be you and let it show. If people don't like you the way you are, brush it off and embrace yourself. You are unique and special, so enjoy the wonderful things that make you stand out from the crowd.\nIgnore the opinions of others, unless they come from someone you deeply respect. But random gossip or criticism that seems unfair – don’t let it rock you if you know you operated in good faith.\n12. You will be happier if you are not isolated or alone. If you feel like you have isolated yourself, force yourself to reach out to others or at least to slowly build relationships, even casual ones. Connection leads to happiness.\n\nSupport groups, friends at work, joining a new church or workout club, these are all ways to meet new people. Your support system could be a pet. Many people feel better when they are around pets, because pets provide constant and unconditional love.\nA therapist could be part of your support system. Every individual is different, but sometimes people need help working through past issues before they can let go of them and move on to finding happiness. Don’t feel embarrassed if you need to seek outside help; it’s a sign of strength.\nBe a support system for those who love you too. Make sure to prioritize what’s important in your life, and make sure you carve out enough quality time for those you love and who love you. Connecting with loved ones is a happiness builder.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Madoff committed suicide in 2010. \n  \n NEW YORK — The estates of Bernard Madoff’s dead sons have reached an agreement with the US government to hand over a combined $23 million to victims of his Ponzi scheme, resolving an eight-year legal battle over the remnants of fortunes they amassed at their father’s bogus securities firm. \n  \n Mark Madoff committed suicide in 2010, and his younger brother, Andrew, died of cancer four years later. \n  \n Their estates were sued by the company’s court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, who accused the men of profiting from their father’s fraud for years and squandering more than $150 million of client money on their lavish lifestyles. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n Under the deal, the estates will transfer all cash, business entities, and business interests to funds set up for victims, leaving Mark Madoff’s family with $1.75 million and Andrew Madoff’s family with $2 million, the trustee said Monday in a court filing in Manhattan. \n  \n Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here \n  \n The estates will also withdraw their claims in the Madoff firm’s bankruptcy case, which total nearly $100 million. \n  \n The accord also resolves an investigation by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan, which oversaw a criminal investigation that led to a 150-year prison sentence for Bernard Madoff and a 10-year term for his brother Peter. Both men pleaded guilty. \n  \n Bernard Madoff’s sons were never accused of a crime. A civil suit against their mother, Ruth Madoff, is pending. \n  \n The claims against the Madoff clan have been symbolically important for the trustee, Irving Picard, who is recouping cash for thousands of victims who lost $17.5 billion in principal when the fraud collapsed on Dec. 11, 2008. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n So far, he’s recovered more than $11.5 billion, or almost 64 cents on the dollar, by suing banks and offshore funds that funneled cash into the scam. Picard has also sued investors who profited from the fraud by withdrawing more money than they deposited, including Madoff’s friends. \n  \n A fund overseen by the Justice Department has another $4 billion to distribute, but it hasn’t yet sent out checks. It’s unclear how much of the money from Monday’s settlement will go to the Justice Department and how much the trustee will get. \n  \n Andrew Ehrlich and Martin Flumenbaum, the lawyers for the estates with the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP in Manhattan, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment. \n  \n Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment until the settlement is approved by a judge. A hearing is set for July 26. \n  \n Madoff’s sons had said that they didn’t know about the Ponzi scheme and that they went to the authorities immediately after their father confessed to them.

While we don’t have a date to share just yet, there’s more than enough here that this edition is sure to be interesting, insightful and all the other adjectives that begin with the letter i.\nWe know that the best part about The Culling is smashing your opponents and climbing your way to the top. At the same time, what’s a moment in the spotlight worth if you’re not able to shine?\nWe will be introducing a heaping helping of new cosmetic items for contestants to unlock and to show off their twisted personalities.

In addition to the above, we’ll be adding new hair, masks and some particularly dark clown outfits to bring a big smile to each of your faces.\nThe next update will introduce voice communication options to contestants on Xbox One.\nWe know that while many players enjoy coop with their friends, some simply enjoy the dynamics of working with a teammates and don’t always have a buddy, friend or a pal ready, willing and able to join into the action.\nAlso, we know that when playing with a random teammate in the wild you can be left at a slight disadvantage, with pre-made teams often using lobby chat to strategize and gain the upper hand. Adding team chat both levels the playing field and opens up coop to a new crop of contestants who may have been intimidated to jump into the mode in the past.\nIn addition to team chat, we’ll also be rolling out a much-requested communication feature: proximity chat. Though we’re not quite ready to talk shop on this just yet, it will also be included in the next scheduled update!\nEach new update presents an opportunity to add, but it also goes without saying that they also allow us to address several key bug and issues head on.\nSome of the highlight fixes in the next update are changes automatic region switching (Xbox), thrown item disappearance, gas grenade glitches, unequipped cosmetics and more. We’ll have more details when we roll out official patch notes.\nThe wise philosopher C.H.A.S once said, “Not all that glitters is gold, but all weapons that are gold are FUNC’ing awesome!” Possibly one of the biggest additions to The Culling yet, golden weapons will shower the arena during event airdrops and offer players a never-before-seen level of power.\nThere will be be no less than 8 Golden Weapons available next update (4 Tier 3s and 4 Tier 4s), each with their unique sets of abilities and modifiers. The entire Golden arsenal has been locked in, but you’ll have to wait until the patch notes to learn about them all. Until then, however, we have been able to sneak a couple out of Culling HQ to share with you early.\nBleeding Blade - This legendary sword is so sharp and cuts so deep that the bleed it imparts lasts until the victim heals.\nNutcracker - Though it’ a tad weaker than a regular sledgehammer under normal conditions, This Sledgehammer is no joke.

Sim swappers easily pass this hurdle and can even reset the password using this method.\nPolice in California arrested Joel Ortiz, a 20-year old college student from Boston in July for allegedly being part of a criminal syndicate that hacked the phones of over 40 people. His crime spree resulted in an alleged $5 million in cryptocurrencies being stolen from his victims with the help of unidentified accomplices.\nThis is the first arrest involving the increasingly popular crime of sim jacking or sim swapping as it is sometimes referred to. According to police, Ortiz was arrested at the Los Angeles International Airport while he was trying to make his way to Europe. The charges against Ortiz include 13 charges of identity theft, 13 for hacking, and two for grand theft. When he was arrested, Ortiz supposedly claimed that he and his accomplices had access to millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to authorities, Ortiz's modus operandi consisted of taking over sims so that they could be used to steal the owner's bitcoins. Additionally, he would also hack into their social media accounts and sell them for cryptocurrencies. During the recent Consensus bitcoin conference, Ortiz supposedly hacked a cryptocurrency entrepreneur's phone and got away with $1.5 million worth of bitcoins.\nThe victim noticed this the following day, but by then Ortiz had already taken control of the phone number and reset his Gmail password. The criminal then used this to access the victim's cryptocurrency accounts and empty them.\nThis is happening in our community and unfortunately there are not a lot of complaints to law enforcement about it. We would welcome the opportunity to look into other complaints of this happening. We think that this is something that's underreported and very dangerous.\nPower Ledger Up 20% On Deal With Japan’s 2nd Largest Utility Comp.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What happens if the caster of the Imperius Curse dies?\n\nWhat happens if the caster of the Imperius Curse dies?\n\nA:\n\nIf they die, or are weakened enough, it lifts.\nWhen the caster of the Imperius Curse is sufficiently weakened, they no longer have the ability to impose their will on another’s and those they controlled are released from their curse. When the Dark Lord Imperiused Barty Crouch Sr., Barty Crouch Jr. was released from his father’s Imperius Curse as a clear direct result.\n\n“It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.” - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 35 (Veritaserum)\n\nDeath would also result in the Imperius Curses cast being lifted. All it takes to lift it is the caster being weakened sufficiently, which would indicate that their death almost certainly would work, as they’re no longer even alive to impose their will. After the Dark Lord was ripped from his body, Imperius Curses lifted, which Hagrid said meant wouldn’t have happened if the Dark Lord was coming back, implying that the Dark Lord couldn’t easily return.\n\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.” - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 4 (The Keeper of the Keys)\n\nThat Hagrid considered Imperius Curses breaking a sign the Dark Lord wasn’t coming back indicates the caster actually dying should break the Imperius Curses they cast. This is logical, as dying certainly weakens the caster to where they can’t impose their own will. Similarly, when the Dark Lord dies and the Death Eaters are all killed, captured, or escaped into hiding, those they had Imperiused were released from the Imperius Curse.\n\n“He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter, as the morning drew on, that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister for Magic …” - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 36 (The Flaw in the Plan)\n\nThe Dark Lord had died, however, it’s very unlikely that the Dark Lord had personally Imperiused all of them himself, and there aren’t any that we know he’d Imperiused himself. Yaxley had done Pius Thicknesse, for example. However, what happened to the Death Eaters (death, capture, and escape) released those they’d Imperiused.\n\nA:\n\nThe Curse is lifted\nIn The Deathly Hallows, after Voldemort is killed the Imperiused start to wake up. Whilst it isn't entirely clear if it lifts because the remaining Death Eaters are not concentrating on keeping the curse up, at least some of the Imperiused must have been controlled by Voldemort and they were waking up too.\nIncluding the full quote for context:\n\nThe bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.\nOne shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last —\nThe sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic...\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,  Chapter 36, \"The Flaw in the Plan\"", "output": "It will probably be lifted\nThe first and obvious evidence is when Harry immobilized with Dumbledore's spell, he breaks free the moment Dumbledore died.\n\nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.\n“Avada Kedavra!”\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest.\n  Harry’s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as\n  Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the\n  shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and\n  out of sight. \n...\nHe seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest;\n  Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly.

Their most popular product is perhaps the Poker, now in its third iteration with RGB LEDs, which is a 60% keyboard having a layout similar to the keyboards on most 13-15\" laptops. It relies on layers, which if you think about it is something we have been used to for ages now. The shift key when actuated activates a layer on top of the usual key base- shift + a gives A for example. 60% keyboards take this further by removing the function key row, and re-working the others into what can potentially be a more efficient typing experience with some practice. Things can go smaller though, and that is where 40% keyboards come in with an emphasis on portability added in.

Is that meeting your demands of being a line?)\nRather you need to define, when a line is a line with the information you have. For simplicity you could say \"Having at least 5 pixels in either X or Y direction black next to each other, but not having any pixels black in any other direction makes a line\". Then you can scan the image for those lines and store them in some data structure. \nNow that you have your lines figured out, you need to define what to do with them, e.g. \"Every line longer than 20 pixels needs to be dashed, every other line dotted\". \nAlso \"A dashed line has a white pixel at every third and fourth pixel, except the first and last pixel may not be white\" and \"A dotted line has a white pixel at every other pixel, except the first and last pixel may not be white\". Since you know the lines, you either know or can check the lines, and therefore you can edit them one by one to be dotted or dashed.\nThis is of course a pretty high level description, but you don't give much to go on with your question. Perhaps though, this suffices for you to get started.\nThe hard part of course is to identify lines. Try to think what makes a line for you (e.g. direction, thickness/width vs height), what edge cases you may have (a single pixel or square block of pixels) and then you can go about finding them in your image. Note that in a rasterized image, non horizontal and non vertical lines will have \"strange\" patterns of how they fill the image and you will have to decide how to treat those on your own. \nAlso, make sure to not have any lines stored twice (or more) when scanning, because your dotting / dashing process could possibly lead to an unwanted outcome.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The Capitol Police have launched an investigation into the allegation \n  \n \"We were definitely the closest tactical team in the city,\" the unidentified officer told the newspaper. \"It was at the scene very early on, within a couple of minutes.

shooting in Washington DC was ordered to stand down by superiors, the BBC can reveal. \n  \n A tactical response team of the Capitol Police, a force that guards the US Capitol complex, was told to leave the scene by a supervisor instead of aiding municipal officers. \n  \n The Capitol Police department has launched a review into the matter. \n  \n Aaron Alexis, 34, killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard. \n  \n \"I don't think it's a far stretch to say that some lives may have been saved if we were allowed to intervene,\" a Capitol Police source familiar with the incident told the BBC. \n  \n Assault weapons ready \n  \n Aaron Alexis Defence subcontractor IT worker who had a valid pass for Navy Yard \n  \n Full-time US Navy reservist from 2007-11, ranked petty officer 3rd class \n  \n Said to have been Buddhist convert, had gun-related brushes with law in 2004 and 2010 \n  \n Reportedly suffered from sleeplessness, paranoia and hearing voices Profile: Aaron Alexis \n  \n A former Navy reservist, Alexis was working as a technical contractor for the Navy and had a valid pass and security clearance allowing him entry to the highly secure building in south-east Washington DC. \n  \n About 8:15 local time (12:15 GMT), Alexis entered Building 197, headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command, which builds and maintains ships and submarines for the Navy, and opened fire. \n  \n Armed with a shotgun and a pistol he took from a guard he had shot, he sprayed bullets down a hallway and fired from a balcony down on to workers in an atrium. \n  \n He fired on police officers who eventually stormed the building, and was later killed in the shootout. \n  \n Multiple sources in the Capitol Police department have told the BBC that its highly trained and heavily armed four-man Containment and Emergency Response Team (Cert) was near the Navy Yard when the initial report of an active shooter came in about 8:20 local time. \n  \n The officers, wearing full tactical gear and armed with HK-416 assault weapons, arrived outside Building 197 a few minutes later, an official with knowledge of the incident told the BBC. \n  \n 'A different outcome' \n  \n According to a Capitol Police source, an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), Washington DC's main municipal force, told the Capitol Cert officers they were the only police on the site equipped with long guns and requested their help stopping the gunman. \n  \n Odds are it might have had a different outcome Jim Konczos, Capitol Police Officer \n  \n When the Capitol Police team radioed their superiors, they were told by a watch commander to leave the scene, the BBC was told. \n  \n The gunman, Aaron Alexis, was reported killed after 09:00. \n  \n Several Capitol Police sources who spoke to the BBC asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. \n  \n Capitol Police Officer Jim Konczos, who leads the officers' union, said the Cert police train for what are known as active shooter situations and are expert marksmen. \n  \n \"Odds are it might have had a different outcome,\" he said of Monday's shooting and the decision to order the Cert unit to stand down. \"It probably could have been neutralised.\" \n  \n Capitol Hill Police chief Kim Dine has ordered \"a comprehensive, independent review of the facts surrounding the Capitol Police's response to the Navy Yard shootings\". \n  \n The Capitol Police Board responded by establishing what it called a \"Fact Review Team\", led by Michael Stenger, a former assistant director of the US Secret Service. \n  \n Earlier, Capitol Police spokeswoman Lt Kimberly Schneider said its officers had \"offered and provided mutual support and assistance at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday\". \n  \n 'A blind eye' \n  \n Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terry Gainer, who oversees the Capitol Police department, confirmed officials were pulling radio logs from Monday's incident and interviewing the officers involved. \n  \n Aaron is now in a place where he can never do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad Cathleen Alexis, Shooter's mother \n  \n \"It's a very serious allegation and inference to indicate that we were on scene and could have helped and were told to leave,\" he said. \"It crushes me if that's the case.\" \n  \n Mr Gainer said that while the department's primary responsibility was to protect the Capitol complex, which houses the US Congress, that mission did not allow it to turn a \"blind eye\" when asked for help. \n  \n Gwendolyn Crump, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Department, which protects the city of Washington DC, said allegations that a Capitol Police Cert team was on scene and later stood down were \"not true\". \n  \n Alexis had a history of mental health problems, previous gun-related brushes with the law, and citations for insubordination. \n  \n On Wednesday, Alexis' mother apologised to the victims and said she was bewildered by what had motivated her son as everyone else. \n  \n \"I don't know why he did what he did, and I'll never be able to ask him why,\" Cathleen Alexis told MSNBC from her home in New York. \n  \n \"Aaron is now in a place where he can never do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad.\" \n  \n \"To the families of the victims, I am so, so very sorry that this has happened. My heart is broken.\" \n  \n Meanwhile, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel acknowledged \"there were a lot of red flags\" in Alexis' background that had been missed in the security clearance process which ultimately resulted in his having access to the secure building where he undertook the attack. \n  \n \"Why they didn't get picked up, why they didn't get incorporated into the clearance process, what he was doing, those are all legitimate questions that we're going to be dealing with,\" he told reporters. \n  \n Right call? \n  \n The victims Michael Arnold, 59 \n  \n Sylvia Frasier, 53 \n  \n Kathleen Gaarde, 62 \n  \n John Roger Johnson, 73 \n  \n Frank Kohler, 50 \n  \n Kenneth Proctor, 46 \n  \n Vishnu Pandit, 61 \n  \n Martin Bodrog, 54 \n  \n Arthur Daniels, 51 \n  \n Mary Francis Knight, 51 \n  \n Gerald Read, 58 \n  \n Richard Michael Ridgell, 52 Profiles of the victims \n  \n He said he had ordered the Pentagon to conduct a wide-ranging review of the physical security at all US defence installations across the world and of the security clearance process. \n  \n \"Where there are gaps, we will close them,\" he said. \"Where there are inadequacies, we will address them. And where there are failures, we will correct them.\" \n  \n A Capitol Police officer who heard the Cert request over the radio to engage the gunman reported colleagues within the department felt frustrated they were told to stand down. \n  \n The officer described a culture in which emergency responders are instructed to not extend themselves beyond the Capitol grounds for fear of discipline. \n  \n \"They were relying on our command staff to make the right call,\" another Capitol Police officer said. \"Unfortunately, I don't think that happened in this case.\" ||||| A U.S. Capitol police tactical team rushed to the Washington Navy Yard minutes after the first shootings were reported Monday but was ordered to retreat by one of its commanders, according to a Capitol police officer familiar with the incident. \n  \n The officer said he did not know if the Capitol police would have entered the building along with D.C. and U.S. Park Police officers, or if D.C. police had asked them to respond. He said the team drove away from the scene as hundreds of law enforcement officers were arriving. \n  \n The officer, who said the labor union representing the rank-and-file had filed a complaint, was speaking on the condition that he not be named because he was commenting on internal procedures and was not authorized to speak with the media. WUSA (Channel 9) first reported the story. \n  \n The U.S. Capitol Police issued a statement saying that the agency “offered and provided mutual support and assistance at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday. Chief Kim Dine has opened a preliminary investigation into the allegations presented.” \n  \n Officer Shennell S. Antrobus, a Capitol Police spokesman, declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for the D.C. police did not respond to requests for comment. \n  \n If true, the incident would be the first crack in what D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier has called a smooth response by multiple police agencies working a chaotic mass casualty incident in which a gunman fatally shot 12 people and wounded others, including a city police officer. \n  \n At a recent news conference, Lanier said the officers confronted the gunman as “multiple agencies in a single team,” and added, “I have seen things that we have trained for and planned for years come into place nearly flawlessly.” \n  \n But the Capitol Police officer described the incident as embarrassing, though he could not say that the abrupt departure left D.C. police short-staffed. The Capitol Police tactical team is headquartered a short distance from the Navy Yard, and had two teams on duty that morning. A third was training at Fort Meade. \n  \n “We were definitely the closest tactical team in the city,” the officer said. “It was at the scene very early on, within a couple of minutes. They were ordered to disengage and turn back. For what reason, we don’t know.” ||||| FILED UNDER \n  \n  \n  \n WASHINGTON (WUSA9) -- WUSA9 has learned that a Capitol Police tactical team was prepared to enter the Navy Yard to stop Aaron Alexis -- and was ordered back to the Capitol by a watch commander. \n  \n The team was in contact with Metropolitan Police, who were pleading for help, but was turned around by a Capitol Police inspector. \n  \n  \n  \n Two MPD officers went in without the team, and one of the officers was shot. \n  \n  \n  \n The Capitol Police Board has now launched an independent investigation following our story. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine released a statement: \" \n  \n  \n  \n Capitol Police just issued a statement saying: \"I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of 12 innocent lives after the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.

While I am the Chief of Police, at my core I am a police officer who feels strongly about our shared commitment and responsibilities.

Each Barrister & Mann soap I have used has been unique with no soap reminding me of another, and with each providing a different experience. The Vetiver, Heather, Clary Sage is by far the most flowery of the soaps I have tried, nothing like the fragrance from say Geo F. Trumper Rose shaving cream, but it is in the fragrance spectrum of flowery. Like their other soaps the blend of fragrances are nicely balanced making it difficult to for one to pick one scent out from another, but if I had to state which seemed to be slightly dominant it would be the sage. I wasn’t a big fan of the Geo F. Trumper Rose scent because it reminded me much too much of a flower shop or funeral home, but the same cannot be said of the Vetiver, Heather, Clary Sage – it is floral – but just enough.\nThere is really no need to go into great detail regarding the performance of the Vetiver, Heather, Clary Sage, as with the entire Barrister and Mann line, the soap offered a quality shave with a slick, cushiony shave surface, and didn’t leave my face feeling dry.\nI decided to give face lathering a go with my final Barrister & Mann sample. With the exception of my stick of Arko Shave Soap, I tend to not face lather, preferring to use my shave bowl or scuttle.

Thanks, Marco!\nThe following procedure is useful for testing .iso images, as well as for installations where use of a cdrom (or dvd) may not be practical, possible or efficient.\nThis procedire also provides a clever way to add the rich set of application Quantian provides in a small space as it requires only slightly more diskspace that the compressed .iso image itself. It can be extended easily to allow a menu-driven selection between several iso files, which could even come from different Knoppix variants.\nOther than the .iso, we need at least two files, a kernel and an initrd image. The archive (miniroots.tar.gz) containing all the kernels (linux24, migshm24 and linux26) and the initrd images (minirt24.gz, migrt24.gz and minirt26.gz, respectively) can be downloaded from Debian's Alioth site.\nNow, suppose that /dev/hda1 is your root device (which should be formatted for either an Ext2, Ext3 or ReiserFS file system) containing boot as directory: then copy the kernels and the miniroots in boot/ and the .iso in /. Then, you have to modify the Grub configuration file menu.lst (usually in /boot/grub) or the LILO configuration file lilo.conf (usually in /etc), according to your boot manager.\nNow you should be ready to reboot.\nappend=\"ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off vga=791 nomce quiet fromhd=/dev/null bootfrom=/dev/hda1/*.iso config=scan home=scan noprompt\"\nappend=\"ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off vga=791 nomce quiet fromhd=/dev/null bootfrom=/dev/hda5/*.iso config=scan home=scan noprompt\"\nExtensions should be straightforward.

He didn’t.\nRyan, Sessions, and Trump are all saying the same thing different ways. Don't get it twisted.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was asked Thursday to react to the increasingly harrowing reports from the U.S. border, where migrant parents who cross the border illegally are being separated from their children.\nWhile Ryan distanced himself from the policy, he stopped short of blaming the Trump administration — nevertheless, multiple news outlets were quick to incorrectly characterized Ryan’s remarks as a “break” from President Trump.\nAsked in a press conference if he was comfortable with the Trump administration’s new “zero tolerance” policy, Ryan said he was not.\n“We don’t want kids to be separated from their parents,” he told reporters. But Ryan refused to blame Trump, instead pointing to a 1997 a case called Flores instead of 2018 Trump administration policy as the reason migrant families are being separated.\nABC painted a similar picture, reporting Ryan’s comments followed by the White House’s defense of the policy.\nEvolving lies, and a sudden rash of Bible-thumping.\nIn reality, Ryan and the Trump administration are all saying the same thing: The brand new policy of separating children and parents at the border isn’t their fault, it’s been on the books for a long time, and they don’t like it, but they’re just following the law.\nIn a recent radio interview, Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the policy, claiming most children detained by the government are “not infants,” while admitting that the government has been holding babies and toddlers.\n“Most are teenagers, although we do have a number of younger ones now, more than we’ve seen recently,” Sessions said.\nSessions went on to say that the children are “maintained” in a “very safe environment” by Health and Human Services (HHS) — the same department now reportedly moving forward with the construction of tent camps to hold migrant children on military bases.\n“They are kept close by, and if the person pleads guilty [to illegally crossing the border], they would be deported promptly, and they can take their children with them,” Sessions said.\nRyan’s comments Thursday don’t constitute a break from the Trump administration’s own comments on the issue whatsoever: Ryan, like Sessions, claims he isn’t comfortable with the policy but, like Sessions, says it’s not his fault.\nThe White House itself has a different explanation for the policy but comes to Ryan’s same conclusion.\nIn Thursday’s press briefing, Sarah Huckabee Sanders was quick to assert the current situation isn’t Trump’s fault — but she went a step further than Ryan and blamed Democrats.\n“The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade and the president is simply enforcing them,” Sanders told reporters.\nRyan denies that it is Congress’ fault or responsibility — again, he points to Flores — but told reporters he wants to address the issue of family separation in an immigration bill. Of course, if Ryan wanted to address the issue that badly, he could pass a standalone bill.\nPainting Ryan’s comments Thursday as a break from Trump is irresponsible and only helps to further Ryan’s personal agenda of being known as the kind, responsible adult in the room while doing absolutely nothing that the kind, responsible adult in the room ought to do.\nAnd, at the end of the day, Ryan, Sessions, and Trump all see these migrant children as bargaining chips for Trump’s beloved wall: Including ending family separation in a bill that also includes more aggressive immigration priorities for Republicans could force Democrats — who have been outspoken about the issue — to sign onto a bill that goes against other aspects of their immigration agenda.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Chuck Zodda breaks down the best and worst in special teams play, with a special love for kickers and punters. So when Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee runs a fake punt, you know Zodda went to the film room.\nPat McAfee was so close in 2014. Glory was in his grasp, but unfortunately, the perfect spiral he threw to Dewey McDonald bounced off the “real football player” somewhere around his hands and fell to the ground incomplete. Cue the violins.\nBut 2015 is a new year. While fall is typically a time of falling leaves and preparation for winter, for McAfee it means rebirth. It means a chance at redemption. It means that there is again the chance McAfee runs a fake punt.\nIn this quote, McAfee appears to deny this was a pre-designed play, noting instead that he always has the option to run a fake if he feels he can pick up a first down. However, in looking at the execution of the punt protection and punt gunners on the play, it seems more likely this was an intentional fake from the outset.\nJack Doyle (#84, right) takes an aggressive line at the snap, which indicates this is a fake punt. Doyle (circled in blue), immediately goes low and attempts to cut-block the rusher in front of him.\nThis makes no sense in the context of punt protection. Protection units across the league use kick slides to gain depth, rather than attacking rushers in this fashion. Watching Doyle throughout the game, he does not cut on any other punts. This is a clear sign of a fake.\nThe rest of the line takes one kick slide, and then quickly blocks down to the left (yellow arrows), rather than continuing for a second kick slide as they did on other punt attempts. This is yet another sign of a fake.\nOff-screen, the right gunner takes an outside release, turning his man’s head to the sideline and away from the side of the field McAfee eventually runs toward. Everything here points to a fake.\nThis is a coordinated effort to draw the Titans away from the right side of the field. Had this play simply contained the cut block, McAfee might have been improvising. However, given the cut block, the down-blocking by the offensive line, and the outside release of the gunner, it is far more likely this was drawn up in advance.\nAfter a brilliant 18-yard scamper, McAfee decides to head out of bounds, rather than reveal any other tricks up his sleeve. A good tactician never uses more force than is necessary for the job, and McAfee mercifully decides to end the play after picking up the first down. Go Pat go.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The news of its subscriber growth is being delivered alongside a series of pitches to advertisers at the company’s Upfronts presentation in New York this morning, where it’s also touting its upcoming original series and detailing its new ad products. One of those will be of particular interest to Hulu’s users, too – the company will at last allow subscribers to download shows to watch offline.\nThis is a feature both Amazon and Netflix already support, the former as of fall 2015 and the latter since late 2016.\nHowever, the way Hulu is going about offline content is a bit different.\nSubscribers on both the ad-supported and no commercials plan will have the ability to download content for offline viewing – something people like to do when preparing for air travel or for daily commutes on public transportation where it’s difficult to get a signal, for example.\nHowever, ad-supported plan subscribers will download commercials along with their shows.\nThis makes Hulu the first company in the industry to support downloads with advertising, it says. This also means customers won’t have the ability to fast-forward through these offline commercials – the advertisers truly have a captive audience for their content.\nIt’s worth pointing out that when this feature launched on Netflix and Amazon, the focus was on offering downloadable original content. With the option to advertise against the content, though, there may be less resistance to the idea of offering an offline version.\n“We will not only be live and on demand, but also untethered and on-the-go anytime, anywhere. No Wi-Fi needed,” said Hulu CEO Randy Freer, announcing the feature.\nAd-supported downloadable content is only one of Hulu’s pitches to advertisers. Notably, the company will also begin offering dynamically inserted ads in the Hulu with With Live TV experience sometime later this quarter. This lets brands reach Hulu subscribers watching live sports, news and entertainment programming, and will initially launch across some cable networks on the platform.\nThe company is telling advertisers it will use Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (DAR) for OTT to measure, guarantee and report campaign audience delivery across all desktop, mobile and connected devices. But the bigger message is that Hulu is more like traditional TV – 78 percent of Hulu’s viewing takes place in the living room on connected TVs, it says. And across platforms, engagement is up by over 60 percent, and viewers streamed 6 billion hours in 2017.\nAlongside the ad product news, Hulu is introducing a number of new series, including Four Weddings and a Funeral and Ramy, which join upcoming Hulu Originals Castle Rock, Hulu’s second project from J.J. Abrams and Stephen King set to premiere on July 25; Catch-22, from George Clooney and starring Kyle Chandler; The First, from Beau Willimon and starring Sean Penn; and Little Fires Everywhere, from Reese Witherspoon and Kerri Washington, based on the novel of the same name.\nHulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale will return for a third season, and Hulu will be the exclusive SVOD home for ABC’s well-received The Good Doctor.\nThe company also struck its biggest kids and family deal to date with its first-ever multi-year deal with DreamWorks Animation. The deal will see Hulu becoming the exclusive streaming home to future DreamWorks Animation feature films including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, The Boss Baby 2 and Trolls 2, starting in 2019; as well as DreamWorks library films like Shrek, Shrek 2 and Shark Tale; plus other exclusive original series that will kick off in 2020.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"What is the new direction for Gene Luen Yang's series New Super-Man and what changes are being made?\"", "output": "Gene Luen Yang’s New Super-Man has always been as much about the Justice League of China (JLC) as the titular hero, so it makes a lot of sense to rebrand the series as New Super-Man And The Justice League Of China for its change in direction. After being part of the Ministry Of Self-Reliance for the first 19 issues of the series, Kenan “Super-Man” Kong and his friends in the JLC are breaking out on their own as an independent superhero team, but their old boss, who happens to be Kenan’s mom, isn’t going to let them go so easily. The new title implies a broader scope for the series as well as more Eastern analogs of Justice League heroes, and the JLC will be facing off against the Ministry’s new Lantern Corps as well as the Aqua-Man of North Korea.\nThe coolest change for this series is Kenan’s new yin and yang S-shield, brilliantly blending superhero and Taoist iconography in a single image that embodies the book’s East-meets-West philosophy. This exclusive preview of New Super-Man & The JLC #20 catches readers up on what these characters have been doing since breaking ties with the ministry. Kenan is in zen monk mode after learning that he embodies the eternal balance of yin and yang, and it’s remarkable to see just how far Kenan has come from his early days as an arrogant bully. Baixi and Deilan (a.k.a Bat-Man and Wonder-Woman) are now firmly a couple, but their romantic snowboarding getaway is cut short by a monster that feeds on desire.\nArtist Brent Peeples, inker Matt Santorelli, and colorist Hi-Fi deliver crisp, bright visuals that reinforce the lighter tone of Yang’s script, and while there are moments when the story gets dark, it’s never dreary and always balanced with humor. The panel of Kenan meditating on the first page features evocative visual elements that accentuate the ideas being presented in the narration, and the order and chaos Kenan embodies are represented on the page in the frosted-over window in the foreground: order in the square grid, chaos in the snow gathering around the metal bars. The philosophy of this series is as riveting as the superhero fantasy, and it will be interesting to see how the theoretical elements of the story change as the creative team expands this concept and brings in new characters.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Both Narwhal and Antenna are now available in the App Store, but both have been updated to remove the NSFW toggle that used to be in their apps. It is our understanding that Apple's objection is with the implementation of those NSFW toggles. Apple wants them removed from all Reddit apps so that if a user does want to view NSFW content, that toggle must be manually changed from the Reddit website.\nToday, numerous third-party Reddit clients were removed from the App Store by Apple for breaching clause 18.2 of the App Review Guidelines. This clause states that apps will be rejected if they contain \"user generated content that is frequently pornographic\".\nThe official Reddit app, which launched last week and was featured by Apple on the App Store, currently remains in the App Store, but other Reddit clients including Narwhal, Antenna, Eggplant and BaconReader have all been removed for sale. These third-party Reddit clients were removed from Apple without any advance notice to developers, despite some of the apps being available on the App Store for well over a year. It should also be noted that many of these third-party apps, such as Narwhal, did have a filter to enable or disable NSFW content.\nIt is our understanding that Reddit did not ask Apple to remove the third-party Reddit apps. This aligns with Reddit's statement from last week (after the launch of the official Reddit app) in which Reddit's VP of Consumer Product stated \"if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it\".\nIt also seems that a few other popular third-party Reddit apps were removed from the store, but not the official Reddit app. I reached out to Reddit asking them if they knew anything, and they informed me that they did not request Apple to pull these apps, and they were also receiving issues from Apple about 18.2. I think that Apple did not pull their app because they are a big company and were recently featured. As shown time and time again, Apple does not really care whatsoever about indie developers. From taking 30% of barely any revenue to rejecting apps based on features that have been available for 18+ months.\nIt is too soon to say, but Apple's actions today may well be the latest example of policy and procedural failure on App Review.

For men, a lightweight fleece will do the trick.\n4. Gift a pair of lightweight wool socks.: Socks constructed of wool are a budget-friendly option for a travel-hungry gift recipient. Wool sock dry quickly. They also are more resistant to odors, and can compress easily into your favorite traveler’s carry-on.\n5. Consider a lightweight laptop.: Lugging around a heavy laptop on your world travels can be a drag. If the traveler in your life tends to travel with a laptop in tow, a lightweight laptop is a great way to lighten their load. Opt for models that have a slim design, a screen that’s less than 13.5 inches (35 centimeters), and weigh in at 3 pounds or less.\n6. Gift a tablet.: If the traveler in your life doesn’t need to lug a laptop around with them on their journeys, a tablet is a great gift that will allow them access at a portion of the weight. A tablet is a lot cheaper than a lightweight laptop, and can give your traveler the access they need. Opt for models that are compatible with travel-friendly keyboards to maximize benefits.\n7. Give your traveler an e-reader.: Reading is an important part of any traveler’s itinerary. Whether you are perusing a guidebook for suggestions on local restaurants, or passing time in an airport with a classic novel, having access to reading material is a must for any traveler. An e-reader will allow the traveler in your life to transport their favorite tales to faraway places for a fraction of the weight.\n8. Gift a set of noise canceling headphones.: Let’s face it. Air travel can be downright noisy. A screaming baby or a seatmate listening to lousy music a little too loudly can turn an uncomfortable plane ride into one that is nearly unbearable. Save the sanity of your favorite traveler by giving them a set of noise canceling headphones.\n9. Consider a headphone splitter for traveling couples.: If your favorite traveler tends to see the world with their significant other in tow, a headphone splitter will allow the couple to watch movies or listen to podcasts at the same time. This budget-friendly gift can be easily stuffed into a stocking or tied on top a larger present.\n10. Consider a magazine subscription.: A budget-friendly gift for the traveler in your life is a subscription to a magazine that specializes topics that broaden geographic and cultural horizons. You can choose a magazine that specializes in travel, or go above and beyond with one that explores the worldwide geography and cultures.\n11. Give your traveler a journal.: If you have someone in your life that is constantly traveling, a journal is a great gift idea. Even if they aren’t a self-pronounced writer, the gift of a journal can inspire your favorite traveler to start taking note of their journeys. Opt for lightweight journals that can fit easily in a shoulder bag or backpack, allowing the traveler to quickly access the journal on bus, plane, or train.\n12. Gift an e-book.: If there is a traveler in your life that loves to read, an e-book is a great, weightless gift option for their next journey. Take your traveler’s reading preferences into account before purchasing an e-book. If in doubt, purchase a gift card that your favorite traveler can use to buy a book of their choosing on the device of your choice.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Describe a proposed change that you think would benefit the development of squash players transitioning to professional play.", "output": "Today I'm going to talk about a proposed change that I feel would assist with the development of the up and coming professional squash players. As juniors we are normally promised 3 matches and in some international events the tournament is played out to the final positions. I mean, who would want to travel all the way across the country or the world to get 1 match?\nProfessional squash players matches lose and go home, or onto the next tournament to try again a week or two later. When I graduated school I couldn't dream of playing any pro tournaments because I had student loans to start paying back and I knew I wasn't going to make a living by playing professionally. But like myself, it's a lot of kids dreams to play professionally, travel the world and meet new people and attempt to achieve our potential in this sport we love.\nIn PSA events if you lose first round in qualifying you don't even get a paycheque, so it's no wonder very few ever stick with their professional squash careers. I wonder what the annual turnaround is for memberships? There is a lot of pressure involved here, no points, no money and just 1 match! With my proposed change the up and coming pros will have less pressure on their result and can focus on becoming more comfortable in their environment and gain experience playing a variety of opponents at various facilities.\nI don't know anyone ready to start making a living by the time they finish juniors. But still they go and sign up for a PSA tour card and register for some small events. It takes years to be competitive against older and more experienced players. Over the past decade I have seen an extremely low number of Canadians stick through this process for more than a year or two. It's a losing battle and after they put in so much work and go home with nothing or very little they think twice about what they're doing with their life and usually decide to settle down and take a coaching job!\nUnless someone has a lot of sponsors or wealthy parents or is so skilled that they begin winning right away (which is incredibly rare) this is a real dilemma with squash players looking to transition from junior or college squash and become a professional squash player. It makes the idea of becoming a professional squash player pretty unrealistic for most people. So what can we do to improve this process? Hosting more smaller PSA events is a great start but I have another idea.\nI feel that at 5k events the players should be guaranteed 2 matches. Yes, that's right. This means that if you lose first round you go into a consolation. This means for a draw of 16 you will get an extra 7 matches for the tournament organizer and it also offers the young pro players some much needed experience competing on the world tour. Or if you include the first round qualifying losers you have a draw of 12. I don't know how that would work, but I guess they could randomly assign byes to a few of the players.\nI feel that the PSA could offer a small number of points to people who win matches in the consolation rounds and this also keeps these players around the main competition longer to watch their peers, to bond and to see how they perform. The main goal of this concept would be that all of the players leave the tournament gaining more experience; even for a young player in this situation 2 loses is better than 1. With the price of flights and the lack of small professional tournaments in Canada I believe this would be a welcomed change and it could go a long way in keeping some of our young talented players in the sport. This could only trickle up and make the PSA stronger and deeper and it may be just enough to keep a future champion or top 10 player in the game.\nI realize that this proposition means that the 5k events may become 6 or 7k if they are to pay out the consolation winner and runner up. But I believe many young people playing these events will be happy getting the experience as they aren't going into these events expecting to make money, only to get their moneys worth. Also the tournament promoters would have an extra 7 matches to sell tickets for so could probably come up with the extra bit of money from ticket and beverage sales.\nWhat do you think? Can you see the PSA going this route? Should it extend to 10k events? Would they have to penalize players that pull out of the consolation? I believe our young talented players would get twice as much out of this type of experience and it wouldn't be much extra work to arrange. I'm all for the idea. Come on PSA, the ball's in your court!\nI think it's great but doesn't go far enough. Make all main draws of 5k events MONRAD. It's what people are getting used to and offers more experience and much more squash to spectate!\nGreat idea. The consolation players could also serve as referees for the main draw.\nI think Monrad is definitely the way to go - what these players need is match time and experience. However, I wouldn't just restrict it to PSA 5k events, all junior events should be the same.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

However, in the 5th season episode \"Flesh and Stone\" the Doctor suspects that the events of \"Stolen Earth\" and \"Journey's End\" never happened because of the cracks in time (Daleks stealing Earth and their plan to use the reality bomb). Therefore there would have been no reason for the Doctor to wipe Donna's mind. So what happened to Donna?", "output": "Donna is fine, and her memory is still wiped.\nThis is because the events of \"Journey's End\" still technically happened. As we've seen, the cracks work in such a way that even when they erase something from existence, that thing's imprint on causality remains. It doesn't make much sense logically, but that's paradoxes for you.\nIn the same way that the events of \"Journey's End\" can still have happened even after the event itself was erased from history, the Byzantium remained crashed even after the Weeping Angels who crashed it were erased, Amy continued to exist even though her parents were erased, and Rory's engagement ring stayed on the TARDIS even though he was erased.\nThere are a number of other examples, but the point is that the cracks create contradictory paradoxes in that even though things are being removed from time, their effects on the timeline are not. Therefore, Donnna would still have had her memory wiped because the events that caused that to happen, though erased, still had an effect on the timeline.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Earlier today the habitual rumors about the presence of a camera on the next generation iPod Touch were circulating and this seems to tie in rather nicely with the configuration screen which is supposedly from the developer seed of iOS 4.1 which shows that FaceTime will use and email to identify the user for the purpose of placing video calls.\nIt is not recent news that Apple has experimented with adding a camera to the iPod Touch in the past. A couple of prototypes of a third generation iPod Touch with a camera have surfaced in the past several months.\nSteve Jobs himself, in his keynote at WWDC 2010, mentioned that Apple expected to sell tens of millions of FaceTime devices. We must therefore assume either the iPod Touch, the iPad or both will get FaceTime support in the not too distant future. As I don’t really expect to see a new iPad announced before January it seems likely that 2010 is really the year in which the iPod Touch will finally get a camera.\nWhile the Boy Genius suggests that FaceTime will use an Apple ID for user identification, the screenshots show only mention an email so it might be possible that it accept an email that is not tied to an Apple ID as your FaceTime “number”. On the iPhone FaceTime makes use of the actual phone number of the person you want to call, but on the iPad and iPod Touch there is no phone number so another solution for identifying the person you want to call.\nUsing email addresses is a good idea as just about anyone with an iPod, iPad will have an email account and anyone tha doesn’t can always get one free.

{"input": "How much debt is too much?", "output": "The biggest economy in the world just reached a new peak with their unemployment rate. We are not talking about the United States but the massive block in the Eurozone. The unemployment rate in the 17 country block reached a new all-time high at 10.9 percent as austerity measures are being used to combat massive levels of debt. There is no single rule of thumb as to how much debt is too much. A few respected economists from the 1800s once stated that too much debt is reached when the market suddenly acknowledges that too much debt has been reached. In Europe it appears that this apex of debt has been reached and certainly in a handful of economies too much debt has been reached. The trouble of course is that Europe is a massive trading partner to the US but also the world. It is naïve to think that issues in the European zone will not trickle over to our already fragile economy. The working and middle class are likely to have another tough challenge put ahead of them as countries overseas begin redefining what life is like with too much debt.\nI find this debt epidemic fascinating from a case study in behavioral economics. Here in the US, many confuse access to debt with money. This is a modern day mentality that is commonplace but very misguided. Debt does not equal money. Yet it is understandable how the public can confuse the two. Money is a medium of exchange for real goods. So if someone can get a mortgage for a $500,000 home and a $50,000 auto loan for a car and a $100,000 for an education, they actually “received” real items from the real economy. Yet they now owe $650,000. Depending on the ability to service this debt, this can be problematic and that is exactly what has occurred. When you look at the total credit market debt it is many times bigger than our current GDP. In other words, we are spending for goods today with money that will be paid off over many decades. It all can work when people believe they will get paid back. It breaks when this perception starts cracking.\n“(Fierce Finance) CEO pay at the big six banks–JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley–fell to $85.4 million for 2011, from $147.8 million for 2007, according to Bloomberg. Average pay dropped 42 percent to $14.2 million.\nThe issue of course is the debt being infused into the system is benefitting the financial sector and keeping the same institutions that caused this crisis to stay afloat. The spreading of debt is going viral and at a certain point, the axiom that too much debt is when people realize it is too much debt is starting to ring louder and louder across the world. If the sound of $190 trillion in total global debt doesn’t wake you up, I’m not sure what will.\nTo answer the question, “how much debt is too much?”, all one has to do is look at the impact the level of debt has on the economy’s overall ability to produce and consume. Once the level of debt begins to accelerate past the point of no return, it begins to eat away at the economy’s ability to pay for goods and services as more and more income is redirected towards debt servicing and away from production/consumption.\nThis is what is known as “debt deflation” and the result is a shrinking economy as less money is available for the production of goods and services.\nIt’s a vicious catch-22 because in order for the debt to be serviced, the economy must continue to grow but as more money is sucked out of the economy via debt servicing payments to the FIRE sector, growth slows down.\nThe fundamental problem throughout history is that debts ALWAYS grow faster than economies, hence the “boom” and “bust” business cycles.\nUltimately, the only solution is for the debts to be written down or eliminated altogether in order for the economies of the West to reset themselves. This entails big losses for the creditor class [i.e., ultra-wealthy, financial oligarchs and institutions] and explains why they and their pet-politicians, regardless of ideological stripe, resist such measures.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "\"People chant slogans and wave Turkish flags as they gather in Taksim Square in Istanbul, protesting against the attempted coup, Monday, July 18, 2016. The Turkish government accelerated its crackdown... (Associated Press) \n  \n ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The purging of thousands of alleged plotters of a failed coup raised tensions Monday between Turkey and the West, with U.S. and European officials urging restraint, while Ankara insisted that Washington extradite an exile accused of orchestrating the plot. \n  \n Authorities have fired nearly 9,000 police officers, bureaucrats and others, while detaining thousands more alleged to have been involved in Friday night's attempted coup, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. \n  \n Former air force commander Akin Ozturk, alleged to be the ringleader of the uprising, was put under arrest following questioning by a magistrate along with 25 other suspects, the news agency said. Ozturk, who has denied involvement and insisted he had tried to suppress the rebellion, appeared in video from Turkish TV looking bruised with a bandage over his ear. \n  \n President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused to rule out bringing back the death penalty, telling the U.S. cable TV station CNN in an interview via a government translator, \"There is a clear crime of treason.\" He added that it would be up to parliament to decide. \n  \n \"if they accept to discuss it then I as president will approve any decision that comes out of the parliament,\" he said. He said Turks have been calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty because of the increased terror attacks and demand for swift justice. \n  \n Anadolu said 8,777 employees attached to the Interior Ministry were dismissed, including 30 governors, 52 civil service inspectors and 16 legal advisers. Other media reports said police, military police and members of the coast guard also were removed from duty. \n  \n During the uprising by a faction of the military, warplanes fired on government buildings and tanks rolled into the streets of major cities before the rebellion was put down by forces loyal to the government and pro-Erdogan civilians who took to the streets. The top brass did not support the coup. \n  \n Erdogan told CNN that he escaped death by only a few minutes before coup plotters stormed the resort in southwest Turkey where he was vacationing last weekend when the coup unfolded. \n  \n He said soldiers supporting the coup killed two of his bodyguards when they stormed the resort early Saturday. \n  \n \"Had I stayed 10, 15 additional minutes, I would have been killed or I would have been taken,\" he told CNN. \n  \n Revealing new details of the night of the coup, Erdogan said the renegade soldiers were in control of the command and control towers at Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport for hours before forces loyal to the president were able to regain control. He said that about 10,000 supporters were at the airport to greet him when his plane landed. \n  \n He also said that power was shut off at all military bases, including the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey used by the U.S.-led coalition jets fighting the Islamic State group, because the military didn't want to risk having the conspirators use them. \n  \n Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said 232 people — 208 government supporters he called \"martyrs,\" as well as 24 coup plotters — died in the unrest. His voice cracked and he wept as he spoke with reporters after a Cabinet meeting and repeated a question his grandson had put to him: \"Why are they killing people?\" \n  \n He said he had no answer, but that Turkey would make the coup plotters answer \"in such a way that the whole world will see.\" \n  \n As Western officials expressed alarm at the rapid roundup of so many by their key NATO ally, Turkish government officials explained that the plotters in the military had been under investigation and launched their ill-planned operation out of panic. \n  \n The swift move against so many reflected the prior investigation, the government said. It alleged the coup conspirators were loyal to moderate cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally who lives in exile in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and espouses a philosophy that blends a mystical form of Islam with democracy. \n  \n Erdogan has often accused Gulen of trying to overthrow the government, and Turkey has demanded his extradition, labeling his movement a terrorist organization and putting him on trial in absentia. Gulen strongly denies the government's charges and has suggested that Friday's attempted coup could have been staged, as a pretext for the Erdogan government to seize even more power. \n  \n U.S. officials have said that the U.S. will consider extraditing Gulen, if the Turkish government offers evidence that he was involved in the plot or committed crimes. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. would follow procedures in a decades-old extradition treaty and called Turkish charges that the U.S. was harboring Gulen \"factually incorrect.\" \n  \n Erdogan said an official formal request will be conveyed to the United States demanding the extradition of Gulen. \n  \n \"Even if he is a citizen of the U.S., the U.S. should not keep such a terrorist,\" Erdogan told CNN.

As Western officials expressed alarm at the rapid roundup of so many by their key NATO ally, Turkish government officials explained that the plotters in the military had been under investigation and launched their ill-planned operation out of panic.

{"input": "Explain Alex Azar's views on drug pricing and what his record suggests about how he might act as HHS secretary.", "output": "His record suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Monday that his nominee for HHS secretary, Alex Azar will “be a star for … lower drug prices!” But the record of the former top executive for Eli Lilly, which tripled the price of a top-selling insulin drug while he led its U.S. operation, suggests a different story.\nLilly is one of three drug companies targeted by a class-action lawsuit that accuses the company, then under Azar’s watch, of exploiting the drug pricing system to ensure higher profit for insulin and has been fined in Mexico for colluding on the pricing of the drug .\nAzar, who spent almost a decade at Eli Lilly, rising to become president of the drug giant’s U.S. operations before leaving earlier this year, doesn’t deny drug costs are a consumer issue. But his record there and as a top official in George W. Bush’s administration suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nIn recent years, Azar has defended pricing practices, and argued against the approaches to reduce costs to consumer s as Trump endorsed during his campaign, such as allowing the government to negotiate drug prices and importing medicines from oversees.\nInstead, Azar has followed the pharma messaging playbook on drug pricing — deflecting attention to other parts of the health system, and even other countries, blaming them for the high drug costs paid by U.S. patients. He’s also justified drug prices as the cost of innovation.\nTrump’s focus on drug pricing in announcing Azar’s nomination didn’t win over doubters, who no longer believe he is serious about going after the industry he once slammed as “getting away with murder.” But it will make it easier for critics to pounce on what will likely be the toughest barrier for Azar to overcome during his confirmation process in the Senate.\nSen. Bernie Sanders said Monday he will “vigorously oppose” the nomination of Azar.\n“During Mr. Azar’s tenure at Eli Lilly, this multi billion-dollar corporation dodged taxes while charging Americans outrageously high prices for life saving prescription drugs,” Sanders said.\nSanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings commenced an investigation into Eli Lilly’s rising prices for insulin last year, spurring attorneys generals in Washington and New Mexico to look into the matter. The lawmakers questioned why the prices of the diabetes medicine whose main patent expired 75 years ago have seen huge jumps in recent years, with competitors often raising prices in tandem. One of Eli Lilly’s insulins, Humulin R U-500, rose 325 percent in price from 2010 to 2015.\nCummings tweeted that picking Azar is “like a fox guarding the hen house,” and a “slap in the face,” to Americans waiting for action on lower drug prices.\nAzar contends the outrage over drug pricing “erupted because we have seen a complete fundamental restructuring of health insurance,” with a shift to high-deductible plans that puts the burden of drug costs on employees and individuals, he said at a conference in May.\nWhile Azar makes a valid point, changing insurance policies without addressing drugmakers’ markups of existing drug prices, or high launch prices for new medicines, “is avoiding the elephant in the room.” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies drug prices at Harvard Medical School.\nEven Azar acknowledged in his speech that if insurance companies reduced consumers’ out of pocket charges for medicines, those costs would show up elsewhere, likely in premium increases.\nAzar has also attacked government regulators and payers for devaluing pharmaceutical innovation, suggesting that if the U.S. cuts pharma profits, it will see decreased investment in new drugs and fewer new cures.\n“The narrow focus of costs of medicine to the exclusion of innovation would be self-defeating in the long run,” Azar said in a 2014 speech.\nSarpatwari worries such views will lead Azar to promote the idea that making it quicker and easier for drug makers to introduce new medicines will reduce pharmaceutical costs. Researchers have found that drug companies don’t price their products any cheaper when FDA lets them use the accelerated approval process or other tactics to speed drugs to market. Former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf recently said that despite claims by the Trump administration that faster drug approvals lead to lower cost drugs, there is no direction relationship between the cost of development and price of drugs.\nNonetheless, in June, Azar told Fox Business that getting more new drugs to market to increase competition among brands would help bring U.S. prices down. Yet there’s only one example the drug industry can point to in the U.S. where brand competition has led to lower prices — and many where competitors simply raise prices in tandem. For example, Democrats recently launched a probe into the rising price of multiple sclerosis drugs where drugs introduced decades ago have raised prices to match their newer competitors.\nAnd while Azar expresses support for competition, one of the major factors keeping generic versions of insulin off the market have been drug company tactics known as evergreening — making incremental tweaks to their insulin versions or the devices that deliver it, to extend their monopolies for decades.\nAn article published in The Lancet in late 2015 found that most of the recent innovation in the insulin market has centered on improvements in delivery devices, blocking generics by agents that are indirectly related to the drug.\nAzar has also opposed other ideas to encourage competitive drug pricing. He’s spoken out against studies known as comparative effectiveness research, used to determine which drugs are most cost-effective for treating patients with a disease. He argues that all options should be available since different patients may need different medicines. The problem however, is that if payers must make all drugs available, they have little leverage to negotiate lower drug prices with industry.\nThe result is that despite Trump’s tweets praising Azar as a champion for lower costs , few fighting for lower drug prices are pinning their hopes on action by Azar.\n“This nominee has impeccable big pharma credentials but non-existent credentials when it comes to concerns on drug prices,” said Peter Welch, co-chair of the House Democrats Drug Pricing Task Force.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"Why do Catholics call the Virgin Mary a Queen?\"", "output": "Why do Catholics call the Virgin Mary a Queen?\nIt has to do in part with ancient Jewish kingdoms, which operated much differently than medieval ones.\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary is repeatedly referred to in the Catholic Church as “Queen,” and often called the “Queen of Heaven and Earth.” Why is that?\nFirst of all, the Catechism states that “the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of original sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished, was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as Queen over all things, so that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, the Lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death” (CCC 966).\nThus Mary is recognized as the Queen of heaven and earth, and a feast day on August 22 is dedicated to the queenship of Mary.\nThere are references to the queen mother in the Old Testament, for example in the Second Book of Kings, “Then King Jehoiakim, along with his advisers, nobles, and officials, and the queen mother, surrendered to the Babylonians” (2 Kings 24:12).\nThe queen mother in the Davidic Kingdom would hear the pleas of the people and bring them to the king for consideration.\nIs this not exactly what the Virgin Mary does, as Queen of Heaven and Earth?\nFor these reasons the Church has always seen Mary as a queen seated next to her Son in Heaven. Throughout the centuries Christian art has highlighted this belief by putting a crown on her head both in Eastern iconography and in traditional Western art. There also developed over the years a tradition during the month of May to crown Mary with a wreath of flowers. This is often done by First Communicants in many parishes and honors Mary throughout the month as our beloved Queen Mother.\nThe Regina Caeli (Queen of Heaven) is a traditional prayer that is prayed by the Church especially during the Easter season.

{"input": "List 10 instructions to do natural pretty makeup for school (teen girls).", "output": "Sometimes the best makeup look for school is one that gives you a natural, effortless-looking glow. If you're wondering how to apply makeup that hides problem areas and plays up your features while still looking natural, this article has got you covered! \n\nHere are 10 tips for doing a natural, beautiful makeup look for school.\n1. Makeup goes on best when your skin is clean and dry! Wash your face with lukewarm water and a gentle cleanser formulated for your skin type. Then, gently pat your face dry with a soft towel.\n\nAvoid harsh cleansers with alcohol in them since they can dry out your skin.\nIf you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, stick with fragrance-free and non-comedogenic products.\n2. Moisturized skin is the perfect canvas for natural makeup. Choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic facial moisturizer and smooth a pea-sized amount all over your face. Give your skin about a minute to absorb the product.\n\nMake sure the label says “broad-spectrum sunscreen” for full protection against the sun’s rays.\n\nDermatologists agree that moisturizer benefits all skin types, including oily skin. Just be sure to choose an oil-free product.\n\nIf you have acne, the sun can make it worse. Sunscreen will prevent that.\n3. Heavy and full-coverage foundations tend to look unnatural and can make you break out, so stay away from those. Sheer/light coverage foundation, BB cream, and tinted moisturizer are all great options for a pretty, natural look. Use your fingers or a foundation brush to smooth a thin layer of product all over your face, starting in the center and blending out to your cheeks, forehead, and chin.\n\nChoose a product that matches your skin tone so it blends naturally.\n\nStick with liquid and cream formulas since they look more natural than powder foundations.\nIf you’re using your fingers, don't forget to wash your hands first, especially if you have acne-prone skin.\n\nYou could also consider using a face primer before your foundation as it will help the make up last longer.\n4. Choose a concealer that matches your skin tone and use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to dab a small amount straight from the applicator on any dark spots or pimples you have. Then, buff around the spot lightly with a small makeup brush to blend the concealer out and you’re all set.\nToo much concealer tends to look unnatural, so use it on problem areas only.\n5. Go with a setting powder that matches your skin tone or use a translucent powder. Use a fluffy kabuki brush to dust a little powder all over your face. This locks in your foundation and gets rid of any shiny areas.\n\nYou can skip powder if you don't have oily skin since light coverage foundation creates a great natural finish. Powders never look as natural as liquid/cream formulas on the skin.\nUse a powder puff if you want a more matte look.\n6. Choose a rose or peachy shade and use your fingertips or a blush brush to smooth the blush on the apples of your cheeks. Use circular motions to blend the blush out toward your hairline for a soft, healthy-looking flush.\n\nTo find the apples of your cheeks, look into a mirror and smile. The apples are the front parts of your cheeks that pop up under your eyes when you smile.\nCream blush formulas look more natural than powder blush.\nLook for a blush shade that’s similar to the color of your cheeks after you exercise.\n7. For a super subtle eye look, curl your lashes and skip the mascara completely. If you want to enhance your lashes a little more, apply 1-2 light coats of mascara to your top lashes only.\n\nIf you have blonde or red hair, stick with brown mascara since black will look a bit harsh and unnatural. If you have brown or black hair, go with black mascara.\nYou could also use a clear mascara to give your lashes definition without adding colour.\n8. If your brows are a little patchy or super blonde, brow powder or pencil can give them more definition. Start by combing both brows up with a clean spoolie. Then, use light, feathery strokes to fill in any sparse areas with brow pencil or powder. Run a spoolie through each brow once more to blend the makeup.\nTeenagers usually have thick, healthy brows, so you may not need to do this.\n9. Hydrated lips look amazing on their own, so a little balm might be all you need to complete your look. To add a little shine, apply a clear or natural looking lip gloss. A natural-looking rose lip stain is a great way to add a little color without looking unnatural.\nAvoid dark shades since they tend to look unnatural. Stay away from matte formulas, as well, since they're very drying.\n10. Always remove your makeup at night before you hit the sack! Just soak a cotton round with oil-free makeup remover and rub it gently all over your face to get off most of your makeup. Then, follow up with a gentle cleanser to wash away any leftover residue and dirt.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Give me 24 steps to get your nipples pierced.", "output": "1. Do an online search to find parlors in your area. Visit the parlor’s website to learn about their credentials, experience, and the piercers who work there. Check out their prior work and pictures of the parlor to see if it looks like a professional establishment.\n\nIf there are multiple parlors in your area, research several options to find the right one for you.\nType the parlor’s name into your search engine to see if any news articles come up. This will help you find out about problems they may have had in the past.\n2. Check out the reviews on the parlor’s website and social media accounts. Then, check sites like Yelp for additional reviews. Read multiple reviews to see if clients appear to be satisfied with the parlor.\nIf you see bad reviews, look at what the clients didn’t like to see if it might be a red flag. Multiple bad reviews may be a sign that you need to look into other options.\n3. Look around the parlor to make sure it looks like a professional parlor. Talk to the people who work there to see if they sound knowledgeable. Additionally, ask if you can watch them perform a piercing to make sure they wash their hands and use sterile instruments. Here are some things to look for:\n\nMake sure the parlor looks clean and well-lit.\nCheck for an operating license from the local Health Department.\nMake sure the piercers are licensed if that’s required in your area.\nSee if the piercers are trained or certified by the Association of Professional Piercers (APP).\nCheck that they are using a sterile piercing needle and not a piercing gun. Piercing guns can’t be sterilized, so they can lead to an infection.\nMake sure the tools are in single-use or sterile packaging.\n4. At your consultation, you and your piercer will discuss your nipple piercing. Talk to your piercer about what type of piercing you want. Then, ask them any questions that you may have. At the end of the consultation, pick out your jewelry with your piercer’s advice.\n\nIf you prefer your piercer to be a particular gender, tell the parlor receptionist about your preference or talk to a piercer directly to arrange an appointment.\nSome piercers schedule the consultation on a different day from the piercing, but you might have your piercing done right after the consultation. Ask about this when you make your appointment.\n5. You will likely need to be a certain age to get a nipple piercing. This is usually 18-years-old. To prove you're old enough, bring your birth certificate with you so that the parlor can verify your age.\nYour parlor might accept your ID as proof. Ask them beforehand if you need to bring your birth certificate or if your ID will be sufficient.\n6. If you want both nipples pierced, you can choose to do them at the same time. However, it’s also okay to get 1 nipple pierced. While getting them pierced at the same time means more pain, it’s usually easier to do the aftercare for both nipples at the same time. Tell your piercer if you want both of your nipples pierced at once or if you want to do just 1.\nIt’s usually cheaper to pierce both nipples at the same time than to do them separately. Talk to your piercer to find out if they’ll charge you a lower fee to do both piercings in the same appointment.\n7. Nipple rings are usually a barbell rod or a ring. Rings are more popular, but barbells are easier to hide and are less likely to pull out. Talk to your piercer about your options, then pick the style you prefer.\n\nYou’ll likely need a gold or titanium nipple ring because they’re less likely to cause a reaction. It's important that your first nipple ring doesn't contain a metal that might irritate your skin, as the piercing won't heal.\nDon’t use nipple rings that contain high amounts of nickel because they might cause an allergic reaction or an infection.\n8. Horizontal piercings are the most popular, and they go sideways in your nipple. However, you might prefer a vertical piercing that goes up and down. Decide which way you want your piercing done during your consultation, then tell your piercer.\nIf you’re not sure which you prefer, ask your piercer for advice or look at pictures of other nipple piercings.\n9. Nipple piercings are typically more painful than other body piercings, but the pain should be quick and manageable. You’ll likely feel like your nipple is being pinched or bitten very hard. Additionally, your nipple may feel hot. Take several deep breaths and relax your body to help you manage the pain.\nThe amount of pain you feel will depend on your threshold for pain. It might feel very painful if you don’t tolerate pain well, but you might think it’s just a minor discomfort if you have a high pain tolerance.\n10. Sit still as the piercer pushes a hollow needle into your nipple. They’ll do it quickly, so you’ll likely feel a sharp, quick sensation of pain. Don’t flinch because it might make your nipple pull against the needle.\nThe pain will likely be over very quickly, so try not to worry.\n11. After the needle is in your nipple, the piercer will push the nipple ring through the hollow and into your nipple. Then, they’ll remove the hollow needle from your nipple. You might experience discomfort as they pull out the needle.\nWhen the needle is removed, the nipple ring will remain in place. You shouldn’t feel it in your nipple, but your nipple will likely feel tender and hot.\n12. It’s normal to feel pain during the piercing, but it should subside quickly. If you’re still feeling discomfort, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Use the pain reliever as directed on the label.\n\nKeep in mind that over-the-counter NSAIDs can make you bleed a little more.\nCheck with your doctor before taking over-the-counter pain relievers.\n13. Your hands can harbor germs and bacteria that might cause an infection. Wet your hands under warm water, then apply a mild, fragrance free soap to your palm. Lather the soap for 30 seconds, then rinse your hands clean. Dry your hands off with a clean towel.\nMake sure the towel you use is clean and dry. A dirty towel may transfer germs back onto your hands.\n14. Gently pull the bandage off of your nipple. Be careful that you don’t accidentally tug on your skin or the piercing. You may experience some discomfort as you remove the bandage.\nIf your piercer gives you other instructions, follow their advice.\n15. Run a stream of warm water over your nipple to soften the crusty material. Then, use your fingers to flake it off of both your nipple and your nipple ring. Be gentle and avoid pulling at your skin.\nIf you prefer, soften the crusty material by soaking your nipple in a cup of warm water. Then, gently remove the crust with clean hands.\n16. Put a drop of soap on your fingertips, then lightly dab it onto your nipple. Gently lather the soap around your nipple and the piercing for about 5-10 seconds, being careful not to rub the skin.\nYou don’t need to let the soap sit on your nipple. If you do this, it’ll dry out your skin and make it take longer for the piercing to heal.\n17. Run a stream of warm water over your nipple to rinse away the soap. Keep rinsing until all of the soap is gone.\nDon’t leave the soap on the piercing for longer than 30 seconds.\n18. After the initial cleaning, you will need to wash the piercing once a day using a mild antibacterial cleanser. Apply a mild, fragrance-free soap to the nipple piercing while you’re in the shower. Then, rinse the nipple piercing clean.\nUse a clean towel after each shower because dirty towels can harbor bacteria. It’s important to keep bacteria away from your piercing as it heals.\n19. To make a salt solution, dissolve 1/8 to 1/4 tsp (0.75 to 1.42 g) of non-iodized sea salt in 1 cup (50 ml) of warm distilled water. Pour the solution into a cup, then submerge your nipple into it. Soak for 10-15 minutes, then rinse your nipple clean with fresh water. Pat it dry with a clean paper towel.\n\nIf you like, you can repeat the soak twice a day until your piercing heals.\nDo not use table salt, which has iodine. Iodine can irritate the wound, slowing the healing process.\nInstead of making your salt solution, you can buy a saline solution at a drugstore that will serve the same purpose.\n20. Cover your nipple piercing at night to protect it. Use surgical tape to secure a piece of sterile gauze over the piercing or wear a soft sports bra over it. Additionally, wear a t-shirt or pajama top to reduce the risk of your piercing getting caught in your sheets.\n\nYou can buy surgical tape and sterile gauze at your local drugstore.\nDon’t leave your piercing covered during the day because exposing it to air helps it heal.\n21. Don’t use any over-the-counter products for wound care on your piercing. These products can slow down the healing process or irritate your skin. Here are some products you need to avoid:\n\nRubbing alcohol or methylated spirits: these are very astringent and are too harsh to be used on sensitive nipple piercings.\nHydrogen peroxide or iodine products: these prevent scar tissue from forming and prolong the healing process.\nAnti-bacterial creams and gels: creams such as Neosporin or Bacitracin should not be used on nipple piercings as they cause the piercing to become moist and prevent the piercing from healing quickly.\nYou should also avoid putting products like sun tan lotion, baby oil or tea tree oil on the nipple, as they can cause the skin to become irritated.\n22. It is important that you avoid touching or playing with the piercing as much as possible during the healing process. Bacteria from your hands can easily enter the wound and cause the piercing to become infected, which is the last thing you want. This includes not allowing your partner to touch or lick your pierced nipple. If you absolutely have to touch the piercing, remember to wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap first or wear gloves.\n\nYou should avoid twisting or turning the ring in the piercing for the first couple of months, except when cleaning. Twisting the ring aggravates the piercing and slows down healing.\nYou should also be careful when playing sports or during any physical activity, as the ring may be torn from the piercing if knocked against too roughly.\nYou can cover the piercing with a bandage or some surgical tape to protect it during physical activity, but you must remove the tape immediately afterward and wash the piercing thoroughly.\nDo not remove the ring or barbell from the piercing until it has fully healed.\n23. You likely won’t get an infection if you take good care of your piercing. However, it’s possible for your piercing to develop an infection, which may require treatment. Look for infection symptoms like nipple soreness, redness, swelling, and potentially blood or pus. If you notice these symptoms, visit your doctor for treatment.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to treat your infection.\nDon’t try to remove your nipple ring because your piercing may close up. This can make the infection worse, as the piercing won’t be able to drain.\nIf your doctor recommends removing the piercing, visit your piercer to have it done. Don’t do it yourself.\n24. With proper care, nipple piercings usually heal in about 3-6 months. Your nipple will likely feel tender for the first few days, but it’ll get more comfortable as time progresses. Continue to care for your piercing until it’s fully healed.\nKeep in mind that some people may take up to a year to fully heal. Additionally, it’s possible that your nipple will reject the piercing. If your nipple keeps getting infected or has a red streak, it’s likely rejecting the piercing.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What resources are available to learn WebGL?", "output": "More stuff happens inside the GPU.\nThe GPU draws the results of all the stuff in an HTML canvas element.\nSetting up this drawing process comes with a lot of initial ceremony. It might seem overwhelming without prior OpenGL programming experience, but this is a one-time cost. An early investment in a few different concepts becomes the foundation for creating a custom rendering pipeline tailored to the individual needs of a system.\nA basic program that exercises every piece of the above diagram can be assembled from the bottom up. But first, some initial setup.\nThe gl variable contains a reference to a WebGL rendering context. This context is the main interface for the WebGL API.\nShaders are pre-compiled drawing programs that run inside the GPU. They are written in a C-like language called GLSL and provide rendering instructions to the GPU. Two types of shaders are used in this pipeline example: Vertex and fragment.\nVertex shaders describe how to draw the vertices making up one or more polygons. For the purposes of this example, that means a list of two-dimensional coordinates. However, the vertex shader does not know the actual positions of these coordinates. It knows only that they exist, and that they will be available by way of some attribute provided when the program runs.\nAt runtime, an attribute named a_position of the type vec2 (a 2-dimensional vector) contains positional data about a vertex. Convert that vector into a vec4 (4-dimensional vector) and assign it to the special WebGL global variable gl_Position. This program runs once for every pair of vertex coordinates.\nFragment shaders describe the space between vertices. While the vertex shader was called once for each vertex, the fragment shader program is called once for each pixel in the space between those vertices. In this example, the fragment shader program describes the color of each pixel.\nAt runtime, each time the fragment shader program executes (for each pixel), assign a new 4-dimensional vector describing a color (in RGBA form) to the special WebGL global variable gl_FragColor. In this case, the color is always white.\nHooking up shaders makes up a large chunk of the WebGL setup ceremony. The source code for the shaders must be compiled and linked together in an instance of a WebGL program.\nOnce compiled, the process is not repeated unless the shader source code changes.\nCreate a buffer and an array containing positional data. Then, activate the buffer by “binding” it. Finally, declare that the data for the activated buffer is the array of positional data in the form of 32-bit floats.\nThe setup is finally complete. It’s time to draw.\nFirst, declare a clear color of black (in RGBA form). Next, inform WebGL to clear the color buffer using the declared clear color. Then, declare a pointer to the WebGL attribute a_position containing the vertex data. Finally, draw the buffered vertices as a pair of triangles.\nThe results may be slightly underwhelming for the amount of effort, but this lays the groundwork for more advanced applications.\nIn a more advanced WebGL application, the drawing section might be called repeatedly in a loop as the buffered data changes. Drawing 60 times each second results in a target frame rate of 60fps. Everything else is initial setup that may expand in size (i.e. additional buffers, more complex shaders), but otherwise looks very similar to this example.

{"input": "Create an email about SCE Counter Claim -- Underreporting of Volumes -- Confidential --\n\t Attorney Work Product.", "output": "After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to) about the nature of SCE's counterclaim. As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests, review of an \"Executive Summary\" prepared by George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday, EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE. This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim. First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the \"cost to the market\" from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost to the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC, purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim. Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of information to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do we have data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the career and works of Harlan Coben. Respond in detail.", "output": "It’s odd to hear this from a man whose biography is studded with the kind of numbers that torture the more penurious sort of writers. He’s written 27 novels, seven of them New York Times No 1 bestsellers. He has 60m books in print in 41 languages, and his advances are well into seven figures. He’s won the big three in mystery awards – the Edgar, the Shamus and the Anthony. The blockbuster French film based on his novel, Tell No One, was nominated for nine Cesars.\nIn short, Harlan Coben has more readers, and makes more money, than every writer I follow on Twitter combined.\nReaders first fell in love with Coben in the 1990s through Myron Bolitar, a hapless former basketball star who solves mysteries with a waspy sociopath named Win. Coben’s atmospheric, twist-laden stand-alone novels cemented his popularity and earned him an annual spot at the top of the bestseller lists. The latest of these, The Stranger, which comes out in the United States and United Kingdom today, documents desperate acts in a serene suburban hamlet populated with lacrosse moms, and grapples with technological and moral dilemmas taken straight from the headlines.\nCoben’s gregarious and voluble personality stands in a direct contrast to his occasionally grim books. The Stranger deals with internet monitoring; his novels, which often draw upon the tools of surveillance, have become inadvertent time capsules of technology over the years. Coben says he intentionally draws upon life in his own town in northern New Jersey for his novels. “I like to set my novels in places that are seemingly placid, places that are the fruition of the American dream– house, 2.4 kids, two-car garage – and show how fragile that is.” But he also wants readers to recognize the Starbucks and dad jeans, “to maybe laugh a little about their own lives”.\nHis current bout of self-hatred notwithstanding, Coben sticks to a punishing schedule that typically has him beginning a book in January and finishing it in November or December. This year, he’s also busy at work on his first television projects, The Five for Sky in the UK and No Second Chance for the French network PF-1.\nCoben numbers both sorts of writers among his friends, in droves. His college neighbor was David Foster Wallace and he is fraternity brothers with Dan Brown. Anna Quindlen is Coben’s main reader, after his family and his editors, and he and Mary Higgins Clark rap about her complicated plots.

{"input": "What are some steps to run a 4x100 relay?", "output": "The 4 x 100 relay, also called the 400-meter relay, is a sprint relay with four runners. Each runner runs approximately 100 meters before handing off a baton to the next runner. Before running the 4 x 100 relay, make sure that you and your teammates are experienced with sprint running and have practiced the baton exchange. This will help you to decide the order of your team, and ensure that you run your best race possible!\n1. The ideal first runner has an explosive takeoff and never gets disqualified for false starts. This position also requires fast running around the bend of the oval track.\n2. The second runner should perfect their baton handling skills, as the second leg involves both receiving and passing the baton. This is a straight leg, so this is a good spot for a fast sprinter who is not really good at bends/curves.\nThis is a great spot for your fastest runner if they are much faster than the other three. This is especially true if your fastest runner is also great at baton handoffs.\n3. In general, shorter runners are best around curves because they can accelerate faster than taller runners. This position also benefits from good baton handoff skills, and from the ability to compete under the pressure.\nAlthough unorthodox, it could be smart to put your fastest runner here if they are also good on bends. A 200m specialist could do well on this leg.\n4. Many teams place their fastest runner last, perhaps so they can claim the glory! In fact, psychology may be more important than raw speed. This runner cannot get discouraged if they start the fourth leg behind the other teams. Choose a competitor who thrives under the end of race pressure.\n\nIf your two fastest runners are much faster than the other two, place them second and fourth. This allows you to maximize the distance they run.\n\nAt high levels of competition, choose a runner with advanced finishing techniques. This includes \"lifting,\" a running form with light ground contact and rapid knee lifts, and lunging, a carefully timed forward fall so the chest crosses the finish line sooner.\n5. All of your planning above will fall apart if an athlete can't perform consistent baton handoffs. Consider these problems before you finalize the positions, and don't hesitate to rearrange if issues arise during practice:\n\nSize differences: If one runner is much taller than another, they may have trouble exchanging batons smoothly. Space them out so they don’t have to do a baton exchange.\n\nIf a pair of athletes do not practice well together for temperamental reasons, and the coach cannot solve this problem, consider rearranging so they don't have a handoff together.\nIf one athlete is particularly poor at passing, consider placing them fourth. If an athlete is poor at receiving, consider putting them first.\n6. There are generally three methods of passing the baton: the upsweep, the down sweep, and the push pass. Try all three and see which your teammates prefer:\n\nUpsweep: the outgoing runner runs with their hand behind them at hip level, palm down and thumb outstretched to form a V shape. The incoming runner inserts the baton upward between the thumb and fingers.\nDownsweep: similar to the upsweep, but the outgoing runner's hand is palm up and receives the baton in a downward motion.\nPush pass: the outgoing runner holds their arm high up behind them, with the palm sideways and the thumb pointing down. The incoming runner holds the baton vertically and pushes it into the palm.\n7. When all goes well, the relay race is a smooth series of transfers, with no awkward jerks across the lane or switching from an athlete's left hand to the right. Practice this pattern until all four runners find it automatic:\n\nFirst runner holds baton in right hand and runs on the inside edge of the lane.\nSecond runner holds baton in left hand and stays on the outside.\nThird runner holds baton in right hand and stays on the inside.\nFourth runner holds baton in left hand and receives on the outside.\n8. Each baton handoff must occur inside a 20-meter changeover zone, between two yellow marks. The outgoing runner can start running up to 10 meters ahead of the changeover zone, but can only receive the baton within the zone. Use tactics as well as trial and error to find an exchange position that maximizes speed and smooth handoffs:\n\nIdeally, you can exchange the baton about 5 meters from the end of the zone. This gives the outgoing runner more time to accelerate before receiving.\n\nIf the athletes have trouble with a quick handoff, or if they get nervous and slow down while waiting, exchange the baton just past the middle of the zone.\n\nIf one athlete is significantly faster than the others, they can receive earlier in the zone, carrying the baton for more than 100 meters.\n9. A huge mistake in relay racing is to slow down before you release the baton. The best way to prevent this is to form the habit of \"running through the zone.\" Keep up a full sprint until you're about halfway through the next leg. If both runners have positioned themselves well (on opposite sides of the lane), the incoming runner should be able to run close behind without fearing a collision.\n10. The 4x100 is all about speed. To prepare for the race, do drills such as hill sprints, suicides, and sprinting around comes to work on your agility and speed. Hill sprints are especially good for improving acceleration.\n11. You don’t want the first time you run the race to be at the track meet or event. Run the event several times at least, at full speed. Have a coach or friend who is knowledgeable about running time each of your attempts. Also, have your friend or coach watch each runner and offer any critiques that they might have.\n12. After doing warm-ups, make sure that every runner is in position. The first runner should be positioned on the starting blocks, holding the baton in his or her right hand.\n\nThe second runner should be positioned at the acceleration zone 10 meters before the first exchange zone. Each exchange zone is marked on most tracks by large, usually red, triangles. There should be a smaller triangle that marks the acceleration zone, which is where the second runner should be positioned.\nThe third runner should be at the second acceleration zone before the exchange zone, and the fourth runner should be at the last acceleration zone.\n13. As soon as the whistle is blown, the first runner should start sprinting. Make sure that they lean in and accelerate through the bend in the track. They will run slightly more than 100 meters to the first exchange zone.\nMake sure that the runner runs on the inside of their lane, on the left-hand side, so that they can pass the baton to the next runner’s left hand.\n14. The first runner, with the baton in their right hand, will approach the exchange zone. The second runner should have their head turned, watching the incoming runner. When the incoming runner is about 7 meters from the outgoing runner, the outgoing runner should turn their head back and start running with their hand out. The first runner will hand the baton over to the second runner, who will take the baton in their left hand if the first runner hold it at his/her right hand.\nMake sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone because your team will be disqualified if it happens before or after the zone.\n15. The second runner will a straight leg of the track for another 100 meters. Make sure they are running on the right side of their lane. Meanwhile, the third runner will start running as soon as the second runner approaches the exchange zone. The second runner will pass the baton from his or her left hand into the right hand of the third runner.\nAgain, be sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone.\n16. The third runner will run around the bend on the track, the baton in their right hand. As they approach the last exchange zone, the fourth runner will start running with their hand out, and the incoming runner will put the baton in their left hand, making sure the exchange happens within the exchange zone.\n17. The fourth runner, with the baton in their left hand, will run another 100 meters past the exchange zone to finish the race. Make sure that the fourth runner doesn’t slow down before the finish line, and instead sprints until they have crossed the line, with the baton still in their hand.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The poll was conducted June 8-17 and had a margin of error of 2.83 points.\nFor races lower on the ballot, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick had a 6-point lead over Democrat Mike Collier, and Attorney General Ken Paxton led Democrat Justin Nelson by a single point, according to the poll.\nAmong top GOP officeholders, only Gov. Greg Abbott, who had high favorability ratings in the poll, had a comfortable double-digit lead — 12 points over Democrat Lupe Valdez, a former Dallas County sheriff.\n\"Abbott is governor at a time when the economy is still chugging along, there's been no major scandals or real controversies surrounding his administration, and there's no real hot-button issue that would divide support for him,\" said Daron Shaw, a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin and co-director of the poll. \"He ends up being kind of a top-end Republican candidate right now. There's no real negatives for him.\"\nThe U.S. Senate race appears to have tightened in recent weeks.\nA Quinnipiac University survey conducted May 23-29 gave Cruz a wider, 11-point lead, with 50 percent to O'Rourke's 39 percent. In that survey, Cruz enjoyed strong backing from men and white voters, while he and O'Rourke were effectively tied among women and Hispanics. The poll of 961 registered voters had a margin of error of 3.8 points.\nIn the governor’s race, the new UT/Texas Tribune poll shows Abbott coasting against Valdez, with 44 percent to her 32 percent. But the double-digit margin is lower than in the Quinnipiac poll, which had Abbott leading Valdez by nearly 20 points — 53 percent to 34 percent.\nThe governor and U.S. Senate races will top the Texas ballot in November, and with Texans’ propensity for casting straight-ticket votes, that means whichever party is leading at the top could carry its candidates lower on the ballot, Shaw said.\nBut for that “coattails effect” to carry the election for the Democrats, voters would need to be enthused enough about the top two candidates to turn out in force.\nShaw said that because much of O’Rourke’s support stems from his personality, and not necessarily his policies, he’s unsure of the strength of his coattails.\nPaxton, who was first elected attorney general in 2014 and is fighting felony indictments on charges of securities fraud, leads his Democratic opponent with 32 percent to Nelson’s 31 percent, while the Libertarian in the race — Michael Ray Harris — came in at 6 percent. More than a quarter of voters in the poll were undecided, and 4 percent said they planned to vote for someone else.\nIn the race for lieutenant governor, Patrick led Collier — the Democrat who ran for state comptroller in 2014 — 37 percent to 31 percent. Libertarian Kerry McKennon had support from 4 percent of Texas voters, while nearly 30 percent hadn’t made up their minds or planned to support someone else.\nShaw said the Democrats need an issue or policy to rally around if they want even one of their statewide candidates to win in November. It could be something like the 2006 blowback over the Iraq war, which cost the GOP both houses in Congress, or the Democrats’ massive losses over frustrations with Obamacare.\nBut as of right now, Shaw said, nothing — not even the unpopular zero-tolerance policy that separated immigrants parents from their children at the border — has materialized as a standout issue that could create a blue “wave” capable of washing Republicans out of office.\nWhile most Texas voters opposed that Trump administration policy, according to another UT/Texas Tribune poll, Democrats would need to make the issue one part of a wider message — that the election is a referendum on the Trump presidency as a whole — in order to win, Shaw said.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.\n\"For about an hour, it was a clever, if not particularly memorable, speech. Embarking on his fifth State of the Union address, with the lowest approval ratings (forty-three per cent, according to Gallup) of any second-term Oval Office occupant at this point in a Presidency since Richard Nixon, President Obama eschewed the grand pledges that he had made last year to move forward with gun-control legislation, immigration reform, climate-change policy, and tax reform. This year, the first three of those topics got one paragraph each—and tax reform was hardly mentioned. \n  \n Instead, the President talked about how “inequality has deepened” and “upward mobility has stalled.” He put forth a series of modest proposals designed to provide “ladders of opportunity into the middle class,” such as raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers. And he expressed his determination to enact some reforms without congressional approval, saying, “America does not stand still, and neither will I.” \n  \n To that point, it was pretty much what the advance leaks had indicated: a determined rearguard action from a President who knows that he is down, and who needs a political strategy that can take him and his party through an election year, until, hopefully, a resurgent economy rescues them both. Prone to occasional lapses into passivity and fatalism, here he was sharp, feisty, and funny. This was the Obama of the second 2012 Presidential debate, not the first one. \n  \n He castigated the Republicans for depriving “hardworking, responsible Americans” of the chance to receive extended unemployment benefits while looking for a new job. To support his case, he pointed to one such woman, Misty DeMars, who was conveniently sitting in the gallery. DeMars is a college-educated mother of two who lost her job last year. Obama delivered a strong, and much needed, defense of the Affordable Care Act, invoking another White House invitee, Amanda Shelley, who signed up for her new health coverage on January 1st, got sick two days later, and needed emergency surgery on January 3rd. Obama even elicited a quick thumbs-up from John Boehner by pointing out how “the son of a barkeeper is the Speaker of the House.” (It is not to be doubted that some Tea Party members in Ohio are already planning a primary challenge.) \n  \n But it was toward the end of the speech, when Obama made the customary pivot to foreign affairs and national-security issues, that the real drama occurred. A tipoff had come from an article at the Daily Beast on Tuesday, which was written by Jon Favreau, the speechwriter who worked on Obama’s previous State of the Union addresses. It explained how much time and effort that the President’s staff would put into finding “ordinary Americans whose lives touch us in extraordinary ways.” Favreau went on: “This is President Obama’s favorite part, too—particularly the story that’s often told to conclude the speech. My old boss is a sucker for good endings, and he would send us far and wide to find just the right anecdote.” \n  \n The subject of this year’s concluding story was Army Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg, a Ranger who first met the President in 2009, at Omaha Beach, on the sixty-fifth anniversary of D Day. In Obama’s telling, Remsburg helped walk him through the program, joked around, took photographs, and left the impression that he was “a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.” Just a few months later, the President went on, “on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.” \n  \n Even through the television screen, you could almost hear the nervous intake of breath inside the packed chamber. Remsburg was sitting in the gallery too, of course, wearing his full ceremonial uniform, squeezed between his gray-haired father, Craig, and Michelle Obama. As the President explained what Remsburg had subsequently been through—a coma, ten surgeries, the loss of his voice, blindness in one eye, the loss of movement, and “years of gruelling rehab” to regain some of his faculties—the wounded soldier looked gamely ahead, the rigors of his experience plainly visible on his face and head. And after Obama said, “Cory is here tonight…. Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit,” Remsburg pulled himself to his feet, with a bit of assistance from his dad, and acknowledged the thunderous applause that went on for minutes, and was quite unlike anything that had been heard previously. \n  \n The President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Remsburg’s ultimate commanding officers—the men who had overseen his deployment in Afghanistan—were on their feet, staring up at him and applauding. So were the five Supreme Court Justices who showed up. And so were the members of the Cabinet, White House staff members, and, of course, the assembled senators and congressmen. Remsburg waved his one good arm, tried his best to smile, and got a quick rub on the back from the First Lady. Truly, it was hard to watch. But it was even harder to look away. \n  \n What did it all signify? \n  \n On one level, of course, it was a political ploy—a fiendishly effective way to leave us with something else to talk about than an embattled President defending his policies and seeking to turn the conversation from whether he’s a lame duck. But it was also something bigger and more justifiable. Obama’s speechwriters and spinmeisters didn’t pull Remsburg’s name from a hat. A 2013 piece in the Times reported that the President had met him twice since the D Day celebrations—once at a military hospital near Washington and then at a high school in Phoenix. This was their fourth encounter. \n  \n Ever since he ran for President, in 2008, Obama’s underlying message has been that too much of what happens in Washington is an insiders’ game that ignores, and often tramples upon, the wishes and interests of ordinary Americans. By inviting Remsburg—and DeMars and Shelley, too—Obama was taking part in what’s now a traditional ritual for speech-givers. But he was also trying to bridge the gaping chasm between politics and political decision-making as experienced by its practitioners in the nation’s capital and by the grunts out there in the factories, offices, and Army battalions. \n  \n He was also invoking the concept of public service, which, in Washington these days, is routinely subjugated to partisan advantage. And, finally, he was saying that we can do better, and we know we can—just look at this young man. \n  \n “None of it is easy,” Obama said. “But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow, I know it’s within our reach.” In a bitterly divided chamber, and a bitterly divided country, it was a fanciful vision to end the speech with. For a moment, though, you got the sense that even the President’s foes gathered before him couldn’t have disagreed with his sentiments. \n  \n Read the rest of our State of the Union coverage: Jeff Shesol on executive orders, Amy Davidson on Cory Remsburg and the meaning of war, Evan Ratliff on the many scandals of Michael Grimm, and a live chat about the speech with Davidson, Steve Coll, Rebecca Mead, and Evan Osnos. \n  \n Photograph by Alex Wong/Getty. ||||| Win McNamee / Getty Images First Lady Michelle Obama applauds as Army Sergeant 1st Class Cory Remsburg is acknowledged by President Obama during the State of the Union address Tuesday night. \n  \n Army Sergeant 1st Class Cory Remsburg couldn’t be blamed Tuesday night if the ear-splitting, two-minute standing ovation he received near the end of President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address brought back memories of the day a blast changed his life near Kandahar more than four years ago. \n  \n That was the day the now 30-year-old Army Ranger ended up floating in an Afghan canal—Oct. 1, 2009—after a roadside bomb detonated nearby with an ear-shattering explosion, sending shrapnel into his brain and right eye, and putting him into a three-month coma. \n  \n Sergeant 1st Class Remsburg, who has been awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, was a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama at the Capitol. As Obama detailed Remsburg’s progress, Congress—and the Joint Chiefs of Staff—roared their approval. \n  \n The commander-in-chief and Sergeant 1st Class Remsburg go way back, at least as far as presidents and grunts can go. They first met on June 6, 2009, in Normandy, during the commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. “He was a strong, impressive young man, had an easy manner,” Obama told Congress, and the nation, on Tuesday night. “He was sharp as a tack.” That was the first of their three get-togethers before Tuesday. \n  \n “A few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan,” Obama said. “The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move. Over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day.” \n  \n After more than two years in hospitals and rehab centers, Sergeant 1st Class Remsburg returned home to Phoenix, where he continues to undergo six hours of occupational, physical and speech therapy daily. “My fellow Americans,” Obama said as he wrapped up his speech, “men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.” \n  \n Sgt. 1st Class Remsburg joined the Army on his 18th birthday, after his father, Craig—a retired Air Force Reserve firefighter—refused to sign the papers for him to join on his own at age 17. Now his father, sitting next to him Tuesday night, and stepmother, Annie, are Remsburg’s caretakers, as he continues his long march, back to being all that he can be. ||||| Cory Remsburg stole the show at Tuesday’s State of the Union address. \n  \n President Obama’s tribute to the Army Ranger who was severely wounded on his 10th deployment to Afghanistan brought the entire House chamber to its feet, offering a bipartisan ovation far longer and stronger than for any of the president’s proposals. \n  \n ADVERTISEMENT \n  \n Remsburg, in fact, commanded the room 30 minutes before Obama even arrived. \n  \n Lawmakers chatting on the House floor and awaiting the arrival of dignitaries stopped to applaud as the uniformed Remsburg, blind in one eye and with only partial use of his left side, struggled down a handful of steep steps to his seat in the front row of the House gallery in first lady Michelle Obama’s box. \n  \n Few in the chamber knew exactly for whom they were applauding, but they would learn Remsburg’s wrenching story more than an hour later from Obama. \n  \n The president first met Remsburg on the 65th anniversary of the World War II invasion of Normandy. Four months later, a roadside bomb in Kandahar left him in a coma for three months, and when Obama first visited him in the hospital, he “couldn’t speak [and] could barely move.” \n  \n After dozens of surgeries and years of rehabilitation, he can speak and walk again. \n  \n “Like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sgt. 1st Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit,” Obama said, as Republicans, Democrats and even the stoic justices of the Supreme Court rose from their seats. \n  \n He quoted Remsburg as saying that, while his recovery has been difficult, “nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy.” \n  \n The president highlighted Remsburg’s story as a call for national perseverance, telling a polarized Congress that “men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.” \n  \n It was a fitting theme, as Obama spoke to a Congress that has often shunned his agenda in recent years. With even lower expectations for action in an election year, the president offered perhaps the most modest legislative program of his presidency. \n  \n While Democrats stood again and again as the president defended his healthcare law, pushed for an increase in the minimum wage and new spending in education and infrastructure, the most Obama could extract from Republicans was polite applause for his calls for corporate tax reform, an immigration overhaul and fast-track trade authority. \n  \n Before the speech, several Republicans made no effort to hide that they were more excited at the chance to meet “Duck Dynasty” star Willie Robertson — a guest of Rep. Vance McAllister (R-La.) — than they were to hear another speech from a president they have mostly tuned out. \n  \n Other than Remsburg, lawmakers saved their biggest ovation for one of their own, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), after Obama lauded “the son of a barkeeper” as a testament to the American Dream. \n  \n When Obama turned to face him, a beet-red Boehner flashed a thumbs-up and, looking like he was about to cry, stood to receive the applause. Republicans got to their feet more slowly when the president offered a tribute to his single mother in the next line of the speech. \n  \n A pop culture reference to the hit show “Mad Men” in a call to modernize workplace rights for women drew laughter and applause from Democrats, and chants of “USA! USA!” rang out when Obama predicted the U.S. Olympic team would bring home the gold — and demonstrate its support for gay rights — in next month’s games in Sochi, Russia. \n  \n But the speech, and the evening, belonged to the Purple Heart recipient in the first lady’s box. \n  \n Minutes after the applause for Obama died down, and the president made his way out of the chamber, the remaining members and guests began to clap again and look to the gallery. With help from his father, Remsburg was making his way back up the steps. |||||\"", "output": "By far the longest standing ovation in last night's State of the Union address belonged not to President Obama but to Army Ranger Cory Remsburg.

{"input": "Explain the use of selectors in ng-content in Angular 2.", "output": "When I first started digging into Angular 2, I remember thinking that the ng-content directive was a bit limited in how it would \"project\" or \"transclude\" content. But, the other day, I was looking through some of the Google Material Design code and saw ng-content being used in a way that I had not seen before - I was surprised to see both specific and non-specific ng-content projection working side-by-side. Clearly I'm behind in my learning of Angular 2; so I wanted to do a little experimenting.\nI could totally be wrong about this, but when I first experimented with ng-content, I could swear that it basically had two modes: project everthing; or, project a particular Angular 2 Directive type. It's hard to say - it was never really documented and I didn't do that much digging. That said, ng-content seems to be much more flexible these days. Jecelyn Yeen has a great article on the various ways \"select\" can be used in transclusion.\nThis is my header content.\nThis is some body content.\nAnd some more content, which is so good.\nThis is my footer content.\nAs you can see, the App component is providing the Layout component with a header, a footer, and then \"everything else.\"\nng-content does not have to be the last ng-content in the template.\nAs you can see, everything \"just worked!\" The specific ng-content[select] directives transcluded the header and footer ng-containers; and, the non-specific ng-content directive transcluded all of the content that wasn't going to be transcluded by a more-specific ng-content directive. So cool!\nYou can't necessarily see this from the code, but the order of the content, as defined in the App Component, doesn't actually matter. Right now, the order of content in the App component and the transclusion of said content into the Layout component is the same. But, if you watch the video, you can see that the order doesn't matter - the App component content can be shifted around and the Layout component still renders exactly as we would hope.\nAnd of course, we can see that the duplicate ng-content tags don't explode - they just fail to transclude any additional content.\nThe behavior and functionality of the ng-content directive has come a long way in Angular 2. With flexible selectors and the ability to have specific and non-specific ng-content directives working side-by-side, we can create easy-to-consume components that allow for more natural content definitions. Very cool stuff!\nTweet This Great article by @BenNadel - Mixing Specific And Non-Specific ng-content Transclusion In Angular 2.4.1 Woot woot — you rock the party that rocks the body!\nFYI, this feature is not related to the <ng-container>, works with any element.\nYes, correct. In my post, I linked to Jecelyn Yeen's article where she covers many way in which the [select] attribute can be used in ng-content. In my particular demo, I just wanted to look at what happens when you use [select] and non-[select] versions of ng-content in the same component. It was not something I had ever seen before.\n@Ben, actually it was a helpful information (the [select] behavior) for me, too. Thx for sharing.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

If you're bothered about encouraging companies to produce even more plastic that the planet would be better off without you can buy a reusable handle for regular floss:\n\nA variety of devices exist that will blast a water or air jet between your teeth to remove stuck food:\n\nThese are significantly less portable than the options above, but potentially kinder to your gums, which does appear to be a concern\nDon't forget that you can also get travel toothbrushes where the case of the brush forms the handle when the brush is assembled. They can be loaded with toothpaste and then case closed until you need to use them, so you don't have to carry separate paste, and can be quite compact/discreet:\n\nIt may be worth mentioning Interdental Brushes; a fairly worldwide available product that comprises a tiny twisted wire with short bristles. While you might have similar reservations to them as you do toothpicks, they come in very small sizes(thicknesses) and can be bent/shaped so they angle well between the teeth so they may work more effectively for you:\n\nIn terms of a life hack solution for this, quite often I've ended up with something stuck in my teeth and not had any floss available. In those situations a small rubber band stretched taut can work well. I've also used a strip of plastic cut from a shopping bag; you tend to find that plastic bags will stretch out and become quite thin but remain strong when pulled in a certain direction. This stretched plastic is slim enough to be folded or twisted a little and used as dental floss. Not all plastic bags are suitable - really thin ones like nappy bags run the risk of a fragment of bag snagging where your teeth are close and you can end up with a bit of bag stuck, possibly being more annoying than a bit of food. Over time, you'll get a feel for what's a good plastic to use and what isn't :)\nIf you do overcome your aversion to toothpicks*, cocktail sticks can occasionally be used to loosen stuck food. I've also been desperate enough to sharpen a matchstick by slicing a wedge off it at an angle before now, but that usually necessitates carrying a knife, which may not be appropriate for you \n* I never heard of toothpicks successfully being used to loosen teeth to the point they fall out; teeth are not mounted directly into the bone of your jaw so they aren't absolutely rigid (and for good reason as it helps them withstand impact without breaking).

{"input": "What are the challenges facing residents displaced by the Battle of Mosul?", "output": "The 9th Division is leading the charge in northern Mosul and is supported by American forces. The 82nd Airborne Division has advisers with the Iraqi soldiers and they could be seen working with them. Under the Trump administration the U.S. has been able to move their advisers closer to the front. Usually Coalition Special Forces are forward deployed with the Iraqis calling in air strikes and providing assistance.\nSince the start of May more people are flowing out of Mosul than returning. From May 5-6 the United Nations recorded over 11,000 people arriving in Hamam al-Alil, south of the city, which is the main checkpoint for the displaced (IDPs). In comparison from May 3-4 only 975 people left IDP camps. Since May 3 all the bridges across the Tigris River have been closed due to flooding. That has cut off Hamam a-Alil from east Mosul. Most of the people coming out of west Mosul are sent to Hamam al-Alil, register, and then move on to east Mosul to be closer to their homes. They now must take boats to get across the river. In April, there was a slight lull in fighting prompting thousands of people to leave the IDP camps and head towards their homes. That has since been reversed.\nMixed Migration Platform did a survey of IDPs from northern Iraq staying in Kurdistan and Ninewa. They talked with 339 people in homes in Dohuk and Irbil or in camps in Haj Ali and Khazir. The overall findings, were that few people were happy with their situation and treatment. 67% of respondents felt that their most important needs, money, food and healthcare were not being met, and 52% believed that the resources that were available were not going to those most in need. The Displacement Ministry is supposed to provide cash payments to IDPs. 80% felt that this process was not being handled well with 69% saying they had not received any money at all. Only 6% were happy with the system. People were divided over services. When asked whether they were fair, 17% said not very much, 18% were neutral, 27% said mostly yes, and 9% were completely satisfied. Lack of jobs was another major concern with 38% saying they were not able to make a living, 27% said there was not much employment, and only 16% saying they were happy with the situation. 69% told the organization they didn’t feel they were going to be able to find any work at all. When asked whether they could find information on assistance available from organizations or the government 31% said not at all, 17% said not very much versus 18% mostly, and 3% completely. 27% said they didn’t know. The main information they wanted was how aid was being distributed, how to get notices in general, and where jobs, supplies and health care were. 64% responded that they didn’t know where they could move after their initial displacement. A few months ago, all the camps south of Mosul were full, and there was space in Kurdistan but the authorities were not telling people. 83% said they didn’t know how to make suggestions or file complaints to the government or aid agencies. The only real positives in the survey was that 97% felt they were safe where they were, and that aid groups, the government, and security forces treated them respectfully. The overall results were that IDPs felt completely helpless in their situations. They didn’t know how or where to get aid, were pessimistic that they could support themselves, and believed they were stuck where they were.\nThe Financial Times ran a piece on what will happen in Ninewa after the Battle for Mosul is over. One big issue is reconciliation. Some aid groups have put forward some programs on that topic in other parts of Iraq, but they have failed to accomplish many results. In a central Iraqi town for instance, an aid group paid money to allow people suspected of being IS sympathizers to move back, only for them to be kicked out a few months later. Most politicians and non-governmental organizations think that Ninewa needs reforms as well, but no one agrees on what form they should take. Some are pushing for federalism, while others want more districts to promote greater autonomy. Both the Ninewa and central governments are against federal regions, and there’s no consensus on how many districts should be created or where to draw the new lines. In Iraq, disagreements usually lead to the maintenance of the status quo. Provincial elections are scheduled for this year, which could inject some new blood into the debate, but those are probably going to be postponed until next year.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the potential profitability of trading Zilliqa, and any potential risks associated with this investment.", "output": "The global crypto market is slowly making its way towards recovery and during such times, investors and traders look for new investments in better performing altcoins. Among the handful of profitable altcoins which gained entry in June with a considerable rise in their respective market is Zilliqa. Zilliqa is a rather a young cryptocurrency that finished its crowdsale at the end of previous year. Zilliqa’s markets have successfully gone through May and entered June with a green indication. Zilliqa has been gaining an increasing number of followers since Q1 and thus making constant progress. In this article, we shall discuss how profitable Zilliqa trading can be and whether it’s a risk-free investment or not.\nZilliqa was created as an open source blockchain whose aim is to achieve high scalability levels and remain decentralized. The project challenges Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of speed of transactions and fee. Its cutting-edge technology makes it better than some altcoins out there in the crypto space. Each and every aspect of Zilliqa was carefully made to work better than the crypto giants. Many crypto traders have joined Zilliqa in its journey of becoming the Gem of the market by holding onto it since the time it was created. Zilliqa is best known for introducing mining through sharding and also for its currently under development new programming language named Scilla. Sharding means dividing a particular mining network into smaller shards.\nZilliqa is set to revolutionize the smart contract aspect of blockchain technology through its sharding technology and its upcoming releases. Its platform is designed in such a way to scale in transaction rates as the number of shards rises. Smaller mining units which are created through sharding can process the transaction by themselves and hence solve the problem of network congestion which is frequently experienced by developers in case of Ethereum platform. The upcoming Scilla, the programming language has created much hype within the community because it’s said to be extremely developer friendly and allows the testing of smart contracts before its launch. All of this gives Zilliqa markets the traction it needs making it a profitable investment.\nEveryone expects to make a profit while enjoying the benefits of a certain blockchain project but it’s more than just necessary to keep a watchful eye on the risks associated with each investment. Zilliqa also has its own risks such as foreshadowing regulations which threats Zilliqa’s growth or even make it inexistent. Also, being a young project, there is always a chance of some other improved platform to be better than it and coming up with a newer, better technology all because the competition between cryptocurrencies is fiercer than what it looks like. Zilliqa’s sharding technology also gives rise to some shortcomings, for example, it requires a lot of disk space. Although Zilliqa team has hinted a collaboration with bluezelle to address these problems in the future.\nZilliqa has come a long way since it was launched on 12th January. Its now available for trading on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and many more exchanges are now adding Zilliqa due to its hype and expanding community. As of now, Zilliqa is listed on some of the largest crypto exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Bithumb, Upbit and Huobi etc. It’s also available for trading at EtherDelta, IDEX, Hotbit, OKEx, Bitbns, Gate.io, Kyber Network, Radar Relay, GOPAX, and Koinex etc. However, one cannot directly buy Zilliqa with dollars or any fiat currency. First, you need to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum with fiat currency from an exchange that supports dollars and then buy Zilliqa from any of the aforementioned exchanges.\nCurrently, Zilliqa markets are signaling improvement and progress with its individual price close to $0.127 USD which is rising with a 7.03% indication. At the time of writing, Zilliqa holds the rank of 26th largest cryptocurrency of the world. It’s impressive to note that it has been merely six months since Zilliqa entered the global markets and in such a short span it has grown a lot. Its total market capitalization is close to $933 million USD as per the data on CoinMarketCap. It’s interesting to note that according to analysis Zilliqa market has improved more than 30% in terms of its value in less than a week. It’s presently, making its way to enter the 1 billion USD market and analysts speculate that it’s only a matter of time when Zilliqa crosses the threshold and enters into the 1 billion market capital mark.\nAfter closely monitoring Zilliqa’s movements and doing an in-depth research on its features one question arises in the mind of every crypto enthusiast, ‘will Zilliqa maintain its current performance and for how long?’. The volatility of cryptocurrencies is evident, and nobody can guarantee whether Zilliqa will make a record-breaking profit or not. But rest assured, Zilliqa is going to be one of the best players of this game all through the Q2.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Will pruning back a leggy Avocado to below the leaves kill the tree?\n\nI have an avocado tree that is approximately 1.5 meters tall and all its leaves are in the top 30cm. I'd like to cut the tree back to 20cm but then it won't have any leaves. \nIf I do this, will it die or will it be able to live and grow back leaves?\nbtw, its more like 2m tall and here is a picture: http://imgur.com/hu2nxAK\n\nA:\n\nYes, you can.\nWhen the plant has its seasonal high starch reserves, it likely can be 'chopped with abandon' (so to speak). This would be when new leaves are just starting to emerge. Even then it is a good practice to cut back retaining one or two leaves to branch. \nI suggest you cut back to one or two leafs. This bit of foliage will assure that there is enough of an auxin flow to continue to signalling 'life above' in the branch/trunk. It will, as well, maintain a food source (sugars from photosynthesis) with which to build buds and express new foliage and shoots lower on the branch/trunk that were previously suppressed.", "output": "I'm not an expert with Avocados yet, but when my goats did something similar to one of my avocados about 6 months ago, new leaves did arrive on the scene, but the avo has still not grown back - it was about 60cm high, its now still 15 cm's high - but has a lot of leaves.\nIt is possible that part of the reason is that I pruned it back a few times before (not nearly as drastically, and when the plant was small).   If it were me, I'd probably not cut it down that drastically.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Mining on Linux server, are there security risks?\n\nI want to mine Monero on my dedicated Linux server with xmr-stak-cpu because my websites never use all of the CPU and I want some extra incomes that help me pay the service.\nAre there any security risks for my server and websites by doing this?\nAt what do I need to pay attention?\nI have never mined cryptocurrency, so I don't know how the entire process works.", "output": "There would be no inherit security risk with mining on your dedicated server.  As with all daemons, though, you would want to make sure to run it as an unprivileged (non-root) user just as a best practice.\nSince you mention the server is normally doing other things (hosting websites) you could minimize its impact by running it the lowest priority possible (a 'nice' value of 19).  If you do that, it should effectively only utilize idle cpu cycles and not noticeably impact the performance of other processes.  Doing this is as simple as running:\nnice -19 ./xmr-stak-cpu\n\nSome important notes...\n\nKeep in mind that your processor(s) will be running at 100% usage 24/7 no matter what's going on.  This effectively kills the usefulness of any sort of CPU metrics software and other performance monitoring software.\nIf you provide service to paying customers, note that they will be able to easily see the system is at 100% cpu usage through multiple means (SSH, PHP scripts, hosting control panel, etc).  They may not take kindly to this fact and feel you are not providing the service they're paying for.  Some users may suspect your server is compromised if they see a miner process in the process list.  This is because it is common for malicious users to compromise hosting accounts and run a monero or other cryptonight based coin miner on the server.  I imagine there's a debate to be had on the ethics of mining on a production hosting server with paying clients.\nIt will be much harder to identify if/when another user on the system is using excessive CPU since your system will always be at 100% CPU usage, unless you write some custom script that subtracts the relative usage of the miner from the rest of the system's usage.  Even then, it's going to be unreliable.\nEven if you ONLY ran the miner on your server and didn't host websites or anything else, you're probably looking at between 200-250H/ max (for a Quad-Core single CPU dedicated server).  At the current network difficulty, a sustained 250H/s is going to net you about 0.05 XMR per month (I used cryptocompare.com's calculator to estimate).  A common minimum payout for current Monero mining pools is about 0.3 XMR.  So you are looking at 6 months mining before you get your first 0.3 XMR.  Coin emission only slows and difficulty only goes up as time goes on, so the reality of it is probably longer than 6 months.  If your server is somewhat busy and the miner runs at less H/s, then that time only gets longer.\n\nIn the end, only you can decide if it's \"worth it\".  But, it's by no means an ideal or lucrative situation.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you know how can I deal with social media jealousy?", "output": "Social media jealousy is the feeling of envy that is sometimes associated with reading what people are posting and sharing online. Social media bombards you with perfect images from other people's lives. Sometimes these images and posts can lead you to feel envious of the lives of others or depressed about the state of your own less-than-perfect life. In order to deal with social media jealousy, manage the way you use social media, create healthy relationships online, and distance yourself from social media for a while if all else fails.\n1. It is easy to be envious when scrolling through Facebook and Instagram because people typically post about positive experiences in their lives. They will share pictures from a recent trip to the Caribbean or an amazing music festival, like Coachella. When you see these photos you need to keep in mind that this is not a depiction of regular life.\n\nRemember that these people also experience difficulties in their lives, just like you do, but they are not sharing these difficulties on social media.\nAdditionally, the posts and photos that you see do not tell the true story of how the individuals are able to have these experiences. They may have their expenses paid by others, or they could be going into massive debt to maintain the lifestyle - things you might not want for yourself.\nAlso a lot of photographs posted to social media are cropped or edited using special filters to make them look even more pleasing than the original photo.\nFor example, photos can be brightened to make a day that was actually overcast appear sunny.\n2. Most feelings of envy and jealousy that are associated with social media use are caused by comparing your actual life to the constructed lives of those you follow online. By constantly comparing your life to your friends, you may lose sight of the amazing things about your own life. Focus on what you have, not what your friends have.\n\nFor example, someone you knew in grade school may have just gotten engaged to a successful, attractive lawyer, and you feel jealous because you are still single.\nInstead, you should focus on the great parts of your life, such as your friends, career, home, health, and family. Appreciate what you have and be grateful for your own achievements.\nWhen you feel yourself start to make comparisons, remind yourself that others are likely comparing themselves to you as well. While you may feel insecure that you didn't go on a great vacation this year or that you haven't found a partner, someone else might be thinking that your life is more carefree and exciting than theirs is or that your family appears to have a better relationship.\n3. Try and provide a more well-rounded and realistic portrayal of your own life by sharing both positive and negative experiences on social media. This will allow your followers to view you as a more authentic person. Do not reinforce the cycle of jealousy on social media by making your life appear perfect. If more people begin to share negative experiences it may change the culture of social media. Social media jealousy will decrease if people share both positive and negative experiences.\n\nFor example, you could post photographs that didn’t turn out well and use self deprecating hashtags such as #selfiefail or #vacationfail etc.\nYou could post a social media rant about a negative experience you had that day, to demonstrate that your life is not always perfect and that you face stressful situations daily.\nConsider sharing hard times that you're experiencing rather than just a mistake or a bad day. You may find that your friends can provide you with great support and advice during your time of need. Examples of things to share include a recent job loss, an illness, or the end of a relationship. Just remember to be tactful when sharing information that involves others.\n4. Most people use social media platforms, such as Facebook, to stay in touch with people. Although this can be an amazing tool, it can also lead to social media jealousy. For instance, you may follow multiple people who you went to high school or even grade school with, but haven’t actually seen in years. It is more likely that you will feel jealous looking at posts by former friends and acquaintances than actual friends.\n\nOnly follow true friends on social media because this will give real life context to some of their posts, reducing instances of jealousy.\nIf someone becomes upset that you do not want to be friends on social media, then you'll know you made the right choice. You don't have to explain your choices to anyone. Focus on what's best for you.\nYou are more likely to be happy for the achievements of a close friend than a one-time acquaintance.\n5. Different social media platforms are used for different purposes. For instance, Facebook is typically used as a way to stay connected with friends. Alternatively, Instagram and Twitter can be used as a way to follow existing friends and make new connections. Regardless of the platform, you should go through the list of people you follow and delete or unfollow anyone who makes you feel worse about yourself, or any brands or companies that make you envious of their products and consequently inadequate.\n\nNever feel guilty or ashamed for unfollowing or deleting someone, even if that person is well-meaning, such as friend who shares a lot of \"inspiration\" posts. You are making choices that will help you simplify and feel better, and that has nothing to do with them as a person.\nFor instance, many companies, brands, and designers have Instagram accounts and will advertise their merchandise by posting professional photographs. These types of posts can cause you to be envious of material goods and make you feel as though your own possessions are not “good enough” or “cool enough.”\n6. Another way to avoid social media jealousy is to follow people that inspire you, rather than people who you feel competitive with. For instance, you may want to follow creative people that work in a completely different field than you. This way you may not compare your life to theirs, because you lead different lives, but you can find inspiration through their creativity and work ethic.\n7. If you are suffering from social media jealousy, it is probably a good idea to reduce the amount of time you spend scrolling through social media feeds. One easy way to do this is to logout of your social media accounts. This will make it more difficult to access social media. Alternatively, you could delete social media apps, such as Facebook and Pinterest, from your phone or tablet. This way if you only have five minutes to kill, it will be more difficult to spend that time surfing social media sites.\n8. Plan how you'll use social media in a way that supports your mental health. For example, designate a time to catch up with friends and family and set a time limit for how long you'll spend on social media each day. Choose a time of day when you're less likely to get derailed by social media or depressed about what others are doing.\n\nFor example, don't start scrolling through social media when you're bored at work or school because it may cause you to spend more time scrolling. Additionally, you may feel worse about yourself since you're not having a fulfilling work day.\nTry a time that precedes something you enjoy. For example, check your social media accounts before you head to your dance class at the gym or to meet a friend for coffee. You'll be more likely to stick to your time limit and have something fun going on in your own life.\n9. If you are beginning to feel depressed as a result of social media jealousy and you constantly find yourself comparing your life with people on your Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, or Twitter accounts, you should unplug from social media. This will allow you to focus more on your own life. You may find that you don’t even want that handbag your friend posted last week, and your small apartment is the perfect size.\n\nIf you are not bombarded with images of people living amazing lives, you will begin to appreciate the things that you have in your own life. Make a habit of identifying things to be grateful for each day. Consider incorporating them into your journal, prayers, meditation, or therapy. You can also post a gratitude list in your home.\nIf you're not sure if you're feeling depressed because of social media, take time to ask yourself how you feel after you use it. Ask questions like, \"How do I feel about my life right now?\" and \"Do I feel satisfied with myself?\"\nIf you're feeling down, see if it traces back to social media. Try journaling your thoughts to see if you're quietly comparing yourself to the people you follow.\n10. This may sound old fashioned, but one way to manage social media jealousy is to build and develop relationships without using social media. Getting together with friends face-to-face will help you get to know what is really happening in their day-to-day lives. You are more likely to feel compassion for your friends if you develop real and meaningful relationships. Try these tips to maintain friendships without social media:\n\nCall or text a friend to make plans, rather than send a message through a social media platform.\nGet together with a friend to show them photos of your latest vacation, rather than just posting the images online.\nMeet with a friend to congratulate them on their new job, engagement, wedding, or birth of a child rather than just “liking” or commenting on a social media post.\nIf you have friends or family who live out of town, consider using Skype or FaceTime to have face-to-face visits or communicating via telephone.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Story: \"Welcome, kids, to Santa's store! … He's got toys and plenty more!\" \"I hate this job,\" Doug muttered. He was trying desperately to scratch the back of his itchy green elf costume. \"We're supposed to be elves,\" whispered Jimmie, his best friend, “so try to act cheerful!\" Jimmie smiled as the children formed a line to sit on Santa's lap. With his curly red hair, Doug thought, Jimmie actually looked like an elf. It helped that Jimmie was always smiling. He, it would appear, had a better attitude than Doug. Their job was to entertain waiting children with smiles and rhymes — but Doug wasn't smiling. His green cap was hot and uncomfortable, and his head was starting to itch, making it difficult to pretend that he was really a cheerful elf. \"You begged me to get you this job,\" Jimmie teased, \"and we can't find another elf now. So you're stuck here until Christmas!\" Doug was glad their shift would be over at 4:00 p.m., as he wanted desperately to take off his obnoxious pointy shoes with jingling bells, and to finally get back into his quiet sneakers. \"Welcome, kids, to Santa's store! … We're here for an hour more!\" Jimmie grinned at Doug, but slowly his facial expression turned timid, as he nodded in the direction of Mr. Corrigan, the shopping mall's wealthy owner. If Corrigan caught them goofing around, they would be at risk for losing their jobs. Though Mr. Corrigan wore a cheerful red Christmas sweater, he seemed worried. He was talking to a young woman with a clipboard. What she was saying, the boys couldn't tell — but she was moving her hands frantically, and the boys sensed trouble. Mr. Corrigan checked his watch and left in a hurry — still without smiling — and the woman with the clipboard walked over to them, the elves. She seemed very upset, and Doug wanted to help. \"Is there anything wrong?\" he asked. Mrs. Martin glared. She was, apparently, having a bad day, and Doug had just broken the rules. \"Everything you say is supposed to rhyme,\" she shot back sternly. \"It's in the ‘Rules for Elves’ booklet we gave you on your first day here. Didn't you memorize the rules?\" Doug looked to Jimmy for help. Jumping in quickly, Jimmy said, \"Sorry about my friend. He's new!\" Doug, wide-eyed, followed with, \" … I forgot what I should do!\" Mrs. Martin laughed, \"I'm sorry, guys,\" she said wearily, \"I shouldn't be cranky — especially at Christmas time. But I'm in a lot of trouble. I've been robbed — that is, the store has been robbed. Someone stole a lot of money from one of our cash registers. It's the one in back of where Santa sits, behind the giant candy canes.” \"It's Santa's money that they stole? … They deserve a lump of coal!\" Mrs. Martin smiled again at the improvised rhyme. She, now less irritated with the elves, added that policemen were already investigating the crime. But her worried face told Doug the police weren't having any luck. \"I check the cash register every hour, but I always leave it locked,\" she said with concern. \"That means the thief had to be someone who works for the mall.\" Mrs. Martin had another problem. Mr. Corrigan was worried that the mall wasn't earning enough money, and so he had invited a banker to visit them that morning. She still hadn't told him how much it had cost to build Santa's display. \"The giant candy canes were expensive, and he doesn't know that this year I've hired two elves.\" Now the police were investigating Mr. Corrigan — and it was likely that they would question Mrs. Martin, as she was responsible for all of the mall's money. Beside herself, the only people who had a key to the register were Mr. Corrigan, the photographer and Santa Claus. \"Maybe we should take a look. … Santa's not a Christmas crook!\" Mrs. Martin agreed, and the case had begun. Instead of playing elves, they were now playing detectives. And Doug was happy that they'd get to stop working early. Until he heard some very bad news … \"You have to keep your elf costumes on!\" Mrs. Martin shouted after them. At which point, Doug realized this would prove to be one goofy investigation. \"What am I supposed to do?\" he complained to Doug, “Just walk up to a suspect and ask: 'Any hints that we can use? Have you noticed any clues?’\" Jimmie laughed, and added, \"Know when all the money leaves? Did you notice any thieves?\" But his laughter stopped abruptly when a stern new voice commanded, \"We need to talk to you.\" Doug was startled to see a blue police uniform with a large badge, and a serious-looking man with a big moustache. \"You two work outside the room where the cash was stolen. Did you elves ever feel tempted to steal some cookie money out of Santa's cash register?\" Jimmie was surprised at the question, and police officers made him nervous. Looking nervous made him seem guilty, Doug realized, so he did the talking for both of them. \"We just greet the kids as elves. … We wouldn't take their cash ourselves!\" \"Look,\" he said with agitation, \"somebody told me they'd seen two suspicious elves opening the register. And right after the visit, all of Santa's cash disappeared.\" Jimmie was too scared to talk, but Doug knew what to say: \"We just work outside his store. We just jingle! Nothing more!\" The policeman noticed, with annoyance, that Doug was talking in rhymes. He looked at their strange green costumes, and started to issue a warning with his long, pointed finger. Instead, the officer shook his head and walked away. Jimmie started talking fast, \"We didn't steal the money!\" he told Doug excitedly. \"You've been with me the whole time! Who would tell a policeman that we'd been near Santa's register?\" \"The thief!\" Doug answered. \"They're trying to trick the police into arresting us.\" \"I don't want to spend Christmas in jail!\" Jimmie wailed. But Doug was too busy to console Jimmy, as he was staring curiously at Santa Claus. A happy little boy was sharing a list of the toys that he wanted for Christmas. While he sat on Santa's lap, a photographer took his picture. The child’s mother gave $15 to the photographer. In turn, he gave the mother a ticket that would allow her to pick up the pictures later. The photographer was a silent middle-aged man with bags under his eyes. Doug thought he looked too tired to smile, and wondered if the mall also had a “Rules for Photographers” booklet, since the grumpy photographer was wearing a cheerful red hat trimmed with white fur. \"Smile,\" he said to a little girl — while not smiling at all himself. Jimmie motioned to a table beside the photographer. The photographer had already used several dozen rolls of film; the table beside the cash register was cluttered with empty black cylinders. The photographer seemed annoyed, looking at the two elves with an irritated expression. Jimmie tried to launch an explanation, \"Would you notice something funny? … Do you know who stole the money?” \"I already told the police,\" the photographer griped. \"Besides, I don't think they're missing as much money as they think. Corrigan just wants the insurance company to reimburse him for money that was never stolen. I've only shot pictures of 18 kids today.\" Santa Claus laughed a hearty \"Ho! ho! ho!\" The photographer rolled his eyes, and went back to his camera. The little girl struck a pose, smiling like a movie star. She ran to tell her father about Santa Claus. The indifferent photographer waited while the girl's mother searched her purse for $15. Doug decided it was a good time to question their next suspect, \"You seem cheerful, Mr. Claus. … Have you broken any laws?\" Santa laughed, and his dark, shiny eyes seemed to twinkle above his white beard. It was a thoughtful laugh, a slower \"Ho, ho, ho\" as Santa seemed to think carefully about how to answer the elves. \"No, boys, I didn't take the dough. … They won't ever let me go!\" Doug and Jimmie, confused, stared back silently. \"The mall's rule booklet!\" Santa explained, laughing at his rhyme's ineffectiveness. \"Santa has to remain seated at all times — so I never get a bathroom break!\" Santa pointed at the old cash register, which sat on the photographer's table on the opposite side of the room. \"Besides, when you're as fat and jolly as I am — it's hard to stand up! Ho, ho, ho!\" Santa said, as a little boy rushed in to sit on his lap. The photographer nodded silently in agreement. Once an hour the photographer put the money in the cash register, and it was Mrs. Martin who would scoop it up and deliver it to Mr. Corrigan. And so, the elves headed for Mrs. Martin's office. \"Should we skip?\" Jimmie joked. Jimmie had already thought up a rhyme for when they would confront Mrs. Martin: “We must ask you questions, too. With the money, what'd you do?\" But when they got to her office, they spotted the police officer walking in the same direction. When the officer noticed the elves, he displayed an irritated expression. He tried to ignore their costumes, muttering, \"I need to talk to Mrs. Martin. She's the last suspect, and I haven't questioned her yet.\" But Doug suddenly jumped in front of him, put his hands on his hips, and delivered a rhyme in his sassiest, proudest elf voice, \"Wait! I've assembled all the clues. Tell the thief: ‘Ha, ha! You lose!’\" Who is the thief?", "output": "\"Cut out the rhyming!\" the police officer said.\n\n\"Well, it wasn't Santa Claus,\" replied Doug. \"According to the mall's rule booklet, he isn't even allowed to stand up.\"\n\n\"And it wasn't the Easter Bunny, either,\" complained the policeman. \"Isn't there anyone real I can arrest?\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't Mrs. Martin,\" Doug mentioned quickly. \"It was the thief who lied to you, saying that we opened the cash register. And that couldn't be Mrs. Martin, because you haven’t questioned her yet.\"\n\n\"And it couldn't be Mr. Corrigan,\" added Jimmie, \"because he didn't even know that Mrs. Martin hired elves this year.\"\n\nDoug couldn't resist revealing the thief with a rhyme. \"Go arrest that photo guy. … He's the one who told the lie!”\n\n\"He told us he'd only photographed 18 children this morning,\" Jimmie explained, \"but scattered around his table — by the cash register — are several dozen rolls of film.\"\n\nThe policeman thought for a minute, then smiled and nodded approvingly. \"Nice work, boys. I just have one more question. … Do you also make toys?\"", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I think it perhaps deserves more attention than it gets.\nBrilliant post! You know thy history and truly have a sense of the same!\nThank you very much Jean. You’re too kind.\nShakespeare put these words into the mouth of the Duke of York’s son, a later brother to a warrior King, and again the uncle to a vulnerable boy king. “Gloucester’s Dukedom is too ominous”.\nThank you Paul. I’m glad you enjoyed it.\nof the Roses beginning in earnest?\nI always find the politics and intrigue of Protectorate periods, during periods with child monarchs, to be fascinating.\nThe disputes between Humphrey and Cardinal Beaufort were an important factor in creating the unstable environment in which the war of the roses became possible. The dispute was in many ways a rather unseemly squabble over who had authority to do what – so it was personal.\nThe third important figure you did not mention was John of Lancaster, the Duke of Bedford. After the death of Henry V, Bedford was the regent. However, Bedford, being an experienced military commander focused his energies on the war in France and delegates the government of England to the council (of which Humphrey and Beaufort were both members). This led to some confusion and overlap of powers that were bound to lead to argument (which could only really be settled by Bedford who was rarely in England).\nAlthough it is true to say Humphrey was popular with the common folk; he was seen as unreliable by the majority of the nobility. His divorce and re-marriage offended the more pious members of the English nobility and he had a reputation for a somewhat immoral lifestyle. His second wife was widely hated, which made her a very easy target for Beaufort.\nNeedless to say the arguments between Humphrey and Beaufort became a lot more serious after Bedford’s death in 1435 – most of the nobility up until this time had probably viewed Bedford as the sensible one and the other two as self serving.\nHumphrey – felt that the policy of conquest instigated by Henry V should be continued and the English should put every effort into winning the war.\nBeaufort – felt that this was unrealistic given the levels of debt war in France was bound to incur (already a problem at the end of Henry V’s reign). He therefore preferred a policy of seeking a peaceful settlement with France (a policy his protege Suffolk would later pursue).\nBedford in general did not support Humphrey’s call for an aggressive campaign of conquest (Humphrey’s position was a wildly unrealistic pipe dream given the resources available to the English) although he seems to have opted for a policy of maintaining the status quo rather than seeking peace.\nIt is possible to say that Richard of York was roped into the Humphrey camp (in so far as it was not an enthusiastic pro-war supporter in the initial instance). Suffolk was genuinely (one of the few things he was genuine about) a supporter of the peace camp. However, he was easily outwitted by Charles VII in the peace negotiations (hence the loss of Anjou and Maine). In fairness to Suffolk however, one could make a strong case to say that the loss of Anjou and Maine were Henry VI’s fault – he insisted on retaining his claim to the French throne (Charles VII might have been willing to let Henry keep Anjou and Maine if Henry had given up his claim to the French throne).", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What makes lojban such a \"logical\" language?\n\nThe title says it all. While I have not studied it, I have repeatedly heard that lojban is an especially \"logical\" language, one that could even be a way to speak a \"natural\" language to the computer that it can understand.\nWhat feature of lojban (or features) makes this so? Is it just that humans haven't gotten to it yet?\n\nA:\n\nLojban was designed with a few key features in mind, which are ultimately why it claims the title of \"logical\" language. \nFirst it's good to know that a logical language actually means something pretty specific. It's usually built on predicate logic, and a desire to express any logically-expressible statement unambiguously. No two statements are allowed to mean the same thing, and no statement is allowed to mean two things.\nIn this sense, Lojban fulfills the literal criteria for what counts as a logical language. There's also the colloquial sense, though - the way people think about it, when someone says \"logical language.\"\nIt is designed to be a regular language. This gives it a few key properties that make it easier for computers to process (though it's still an immensely complicated task to implement). Most of these properties are mathematical, and you can read them on the Wikipedia page. However, what it means in an intuitive way is that no word or word phrase's meaning changes based on words it's not adjacent to. That's a nice property when you're a computer and have a hard time maintaining a sense of context.\nLojban also has no irregular forms or rule exceptions whatsoever. All words are constructed based on specific properties that are clearly delineated, using roots that are unique and are intended to mesh with each other as-is. \nThis means that any construction which can be built in a logical form can be written completely and uniquely in Lojban. There are no ambiguities between forms. Note, though, that this is commonly confused with \"the language has no ambiguity.\" It's possible to be ambiguous in Lojban, but only intentionally, and that ambiguity is unique to the way you wrote it.\nIt also allows for systematic, structured learning and use. New words fit into the existing grammar and structure without any other prompting, once you know what they mean and how they're used. No additional grammatical structures are needed to use any words, once you know them. ", "output": "What is meant by \"logical language\", is that the language's grammar is engineered so that any statement you make is syntactically unambiguous. Grammatically correct statements only parse one way.\nIn natural languages, and many constructed languages, the meaning of a statement can be interpreted to be a number of things, depending on context.\nAn example to given in the \"Complete Lojban Language\" book (CLL), is the term \"Pretty Little Girls’ School\". In English, there's no way to tell what this means. Does it mean a school for \"pretty little girls\", a pretty school for \"little girls\", or a small school that is pretty and for girls?\nLojban's grammar is such that the relationship between words is unambiguous. The meaning to words themselves doesn't matter all too much to the language's designers, just the relation between those words. As such, ambiguity is still possible, but usually in the form of semantic vagueness.\nThat said, it's not like there's only one way to say anything. According to the CLL, there are Forty ways to translate the English phrase \"Pretty Little Girls' School\" into Lojban. Among them, is melbi cmalu nixli ckule, which would be a direct translation of the English phrase, word-for-word, and refer a \"school for girls who are beautifully small\". Whatever \"beautifully small\" means.\nBut if you go through the list of possible interpretations, you'll notice that there are in fact some statements that evaluate to the same meaning, either because that's how the semantics work out, or because the two statements can be logically equivalent. (2 + 2 = 4 is equivalent to 2 × 2 = 4 and 2² = 4)\nUltimately, these properties are what make Lojban a tempting tool to use for communicating with AI, who are notoriously bad at working out vague context we use in everyday speech. And it's also why Lojban is called a \"Logical Language\".", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

While some quibble on that definition, it’s at least a starting place. While some have a looser definition, few argue that such an attack isn’t a mass shooting.\nSo, if we take that definition and broaden it just a bit, a mass killing is any incident where three or more people are killed, right?\nThen just why is no one in the national media talking about the mass killing this past weekend in Charleston, SC?\nAn incident report released in a quadruple homicide Saturday morning at a home in Charleston County describes the scene investigators found when they arrived.\nThe coroner’s office identified the victims as 72-year-old Joseph Manigault, 69-year-old Rose Manigault, 42-year-old Kenya Manigault and 15-year-old Faith Manigault.\nAll were listed as being from Mount Pleasant, though their home is outside of the city limits in an unincorporated part of Charleston County.\nWhy isn’t the media at least talking about this? After all, wouldn’t this bolster their narrative that guns are bad?\nOh, wait. Maybe it’s because the murder weapon wasn’t a gun.\nThe four victims all died from blunt trauma, according to Charleston County Deputy Coroner Kimberly Rhoton.\nThe Manigault’s grandson, 22-year-old Lovequawn Matthew Shaire Scott, was arrested on Saturday for their deaths and charged with four counts of murder.\nIn other words, this one man allegedly beat the other four to death. He didn’t need an “assault rifle.” He didn’t need a handgun. He didn’t need anything except brute force to murder four members of his own family (allegedly).\nDo you want to know why I’m an advocate for gun rights? It’s because a firearm is the one tool that could have stopped this attack. It’s the one tool that any of those four could have used to stop this person who murdered them in one of the most brutal fashions possible.\nTwo elderly people, a woman, and a teenage girl are rarely ever going to match the strength and power of a grown man in his prime. They’re not going to be able to fend off an attack like that.\nAnd don’t bring up the police. Despite the best efforts and fondest desires of most police officers, they’d have gotten there well after it was all done.

{"input": "What do you think of VR/AR development with Widgets?", "output": "At Leap Motion, we’re making VR/AR development easier with Widgets: fundamental UI building blocks for Unity. This is the final instalment of our Planetarium series.\nHi, I’m Wilbur Yu! You might remember me from such webcasts as Let’s Play! Soon You Will Fly and Getting Started with VR. In this post, we’ll look at how we structured Widgets to be as accessible and comprehensive as possible. For the purposes of the blog, we’ll look at the Button Widget in particular, but all of the Widgets follow a similar pattern.\nReadability is essential. Write understandable, simple functions.\nCreate base classes that contain physics and important abstract functions. Only one class or gameObject should be responsible for physics.\nBase Component: ButtonDemoToggle. The Widget parent contains no scripts and no components. This gameObject’s responsibility is to determine the world position and scale of the Widget.\nPhysics Component: Button. This gameObject contains a trigger collider used to determine if a hand is interacting with it and respond accordingly. When a hand is no longer interacting with it, the physics component will take over.\nThe physics component is designed such that all the important properties can be changed in the inspector. The script is only responsible for responding to the physical changes because it inherits from a base physics script that handles all the physical movements.\nGraphics Component: OnGraphics, OffGraphics, MidGraphics, and BotGraphics. These components are optional. In this example, these components only contain scripts with graphical changes, linked by the Physics Component. This signals the Graphics Components when to change their states based on the Physics states.\nThis is an inspector view of the Button physics structure. From here, you can specify the spring constant, trigger distance, and cushion thickness (used for hysteresis). The script references the graphics components because it will call their functions based on the state in the physics component.\nDuring each physics update (FixedUpdate), the spring is applied first, then constraint is applied afterwards to constrain its x-axis and y-axis movement. I chose to use our own formula for spring physics because Unity’s spring hinge doesn’t work well when the displacement of the object is less than 1 (as Unity distances equal meters). Since we’re always working with a space less than a meter from the camera, this became a problem, so we had to implement our own spring physics.\nThis example shows that the ButtonBase calls two abstract functions – ButtonPressed and ButtonReleased – when the button passes or retracts from a certain point. ButtonToggleBase overrides the previous two abstract functions, and whenever the button is pressed it also calls two other abstract functions: ButtonTurnsOn and ButtonTurnsOff. Finally, ButtonDemoToggle overrides the previous two abstract functions, and handles the graphics components during these events. As mentioned earlier, other Widgets follow a similar pattern.\nThe biggest problem we came across while using Widgets in Planetarium is that, when the Widgets are approaching astronomical speeds (e.g. flying around the Earth), the rigidbody inertia causes unexpected collisions. In turn, this causes unintentional event triggers. We decided that a major physics refactor with our own non-rigidbody implementation was necessary.\nThanks for following us on our journey through the stars with Planetarium! This demo release is just a taste of what we have in store for the future. Right now, the team is working on getting Planetarium’s source code ready for open license, and putting the finishing touches on the next major round of Widgets releases. We’re also working on adding new Widgets features, including easy-to-use graphics modification functions, event handling, and physics components.\nWhether it’s gazing at the stars or soaring through space, we’d love to know what inspires you about VR. What kind of experience would you like to see (or build!) with Widgets?\nWilbur is a software engineer and master of all things Unity.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

After noting a recent report that May’s Conservative party had received donations of more than 820,000 pounds (over $1.1 million) from Russian nationals since she became prime minister in 2016, Corbyn called on the government to support an amendment proposed by Labour to the United Kingdom’s sanctions and money-laundering bill aimed at making life in Britain more difficult for Russian officials and oligarchs.\nJeremy Corbyn: \"There has been over £800,000 worth of donations to the Conservative party from Russia oligarchs.\"\nJohnson had hinted last week that retaliation for the attack, if it was sponsored by Russia, could interfere with England’s participation in the World Cup, which begins in Russia in June.\nAlexei Navalny, the leading opposition figure in Russia, suggested that Britain should sanction three figures who have amassed fortunes through their connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe list includes Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club in London; Alisher Usmanov, an oligarch who owns a large stake in Arsenal Football Club; and Igor Shuvalov, Russia’s deputy prime minister, who owns an apartment in central London worth nearly $17 million according to Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation.\nAnother form of possible retaliation proposed by some members of parliament was removing the British broadcast license for the local version of Russia Today, or RT, the Potemkin news network directly financed by the Kremlin. That suggestion struck several close observers of Russia as a terrible idea. Max Seddon, the Moscow correspondent of the Financial Times, and Alexey Kovalev, a Russian journalist who exposes propaganda and lies in the Russian state media, argued that the network has little impact but shuttering it would give Putin’s government an excuse to interfere with the more important work done by British reporters in Russia.\nRussian officials and state media outlets have spent the past week arguing, without evidence, that the attack might have been carried out by the British intelligence service, as part of a plot to tarnish Russia’s reputation ahead of the World Cup soccer tournament it is hosting this summer.\nA British public inquiry into the murder of Litvinenko reported in 2016 that he had been poisoned in London in 2006 by two Russian agents who spiked his tea with the radioactive isotope polonium-210. The murder, the inquiry’s report concluded, had most likely been carried out by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, and was “probably approved by” Putin.\nThe Skripals remain in serious condition, along with a British police officer who came to their aid after they collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4.\nSergei Skripal, a former colonel for Russia’s military intelligence service, has lived in Britain since 2010. Four years before that, he had been convicted by a military court in Moscow of acting as a double agent for the British intelligence service MI6 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was pardoned and released in 2010, along with three other men, as part of an exchange for 10 Russians caught spying on the United States that year.\nThe former double agent, Sergei Skripal, was recorded on a security camera last month while buying groceries in Salisbury, England.\nThe Russian embassy in London, meanwhile, has used its Twitter feed to mock reporting on the British investigation, even complaining that Skripal, a former double agent for British intelligence released by Moscow in a spy swap in 2010, would be better described as a British rather than a Russian spy.\nYaroslav Trofimov, a Wall Street Journal columnist, suggested that the incident could test how committed the Trump administration is to its relationship with Britain.\nUS reaction to the Skripal affair (so far muted at best) will be the first major test of whether anything resembling a US-UK ????\"special relationship\" exists in the age of Trump.\nAsked to comment on the British government’s findings in the White House press room on Monday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s spokesperson, denounced the attack but refused to comment on the attribution of responsibility to Russia.\nUpdate: March 13, 4:28 am EST (8:28 am GMT) This report was updated to add more information about the nerve agent British experts say was used in the attack in Salisbury, and note the calls to ban the British version of Russia Today.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "I need to position a bedpan, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you give me 29 actionable steps?", "output": "Bedpans make bowel movements and urination easier and more hygienic for people who cannot easily go to and from a bathroom due to illness, injury, or infirmity.  If you are assisting someone with using a bedpan, whether in a professional capacity or as a friend or family member, you need to be emotionally sensitive and physically gentle. Positioning a bedpan may seem intimidating, but as long as you follow proper procedures, you should be able to complete it without a problem.\n1. Explain the procedure.: Greet the patient and explain that you are going to help him use the bedpan.  Show patience and compassion, as this can be an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation for the patient.\n\nAssure the patient that you know what to do and will make the experience as pleasant as possible.\nExplaining this to the patient beforehand can help calm your patient and reduce his fear and uncertainty.\n2. Wash your hands and put on gloves.: Wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap. When finished, dry your hands and put on a pair of disposable gloves.\n3. Provide privacy.: Provide the patient with as much privacy as possible, now and throughout the entire procedure. \n\nClose the door and cover the windows with curtains.\nIf the patient shares a room with someone else, draw the curtain separating the two beds.\nKeep the patient's legs covered with a blanket or sheet until you are ready to position the bedpan.\n4. Protect the sheets.: If possible, cover the sheets beneath the patient with a waterproof protector.\nIf you do not have access to a waterproof protector, cover the sheets beneath patient's buttocks with a large, clean bath towel.\n5. Warm the bedpan.: Fill the bedpan with very warm water. Let the water sit for several minutes, then dump it out and dry off the bedpan.\n\nThe heat from the water should transfer to the bedpan itself, warming it up. A warm bedpan will be more comfortable for the patient to use than a cold one.\nIf it is a metal bedpan, make sure it is not too hot.\n6. Sprinkle the edge with talcum powder.: Sift a thin layer of talcum powder over the edge of the bedpan. \n\nThe powder will make it easier to slide the bedpan beneath the patient.\nOnly do this if the patient does not have any bedsores or cuts on her buttocks. Do not use talcum powder if the patient has any open wounds.\n7. Fill the bedpan with just enough water to cover the bottom.: Alternatively, you can place a few squares of toilet paper in the bottom of the bedpan or coat it with a little vegetable oil spray (if you are in a home setting).\nAny of these practices will make the cleanup process easier.\n8. Ask the patient to remove his bottoms.: Now that the supplies are ready, instruct the patient to remove clothing from the bottom half of his body.\n\nAssist the patient if he is unable to do this alone.\nIf the patient is wearing a gown with an opening in the back, you can leave the gown on. If the gown has no opening, you will need to lift it above the patient's waist.\nYou will also need to pull the top sheet or blanket back at this time.\n9. Lower the bed.: Lower the bed as far as possible to reduce the risk of injury if the patient falls during the procedure.\nYou should also lower the head of the bed at this time, since doing so may make it easier for the patient to lift or turn as needed.\n10. Instruct the patient to lie in the supine position.: The patient should lie on her back. Their knees should be bent and their feet should be flat on the mattress.\n11. Place the bedpan next to the patient.: Set the clean bedpan directly next to the patient's hips on the side of the bed.\nPositioning the bedpan as close as possible before moving the patient will cause less strain to the patient.\n12. Help the patient shift away from the bed.: The patient will need to raise their hips. If the patient does not have the strength to do so, you will need to turn the patient to their side instead.\n\nIf the patient can lift their hips:\n\nInstruct your patient to raise their hips on the count of three.\nSupport the patient by placing your hand beneath their lower back. Do not do any serious lifting with this hand. You should only provide light support.\n\n\nIf the patient cannot lift their hips:\nGently turn the patient to the side facing away from you. Work carefully to prevent the patient from rolling onto their stomach or off the bed.\n13. Place the bedpan under the patient's buttocks.: Slide the bedpan beneath the patient's buttocks with the curved edge of the bedpan facing the back.\n\nIf the patient can lift their hips:\nSlide the bedpan underneath the buttocks and instruct the patient to ease down onto it, using your support hand to guide them.\n\nIf the patient cannot lift their hips:\n\nSlide the bedpan directly next to the patient's buttocks. Keep the open end pointing toward the patient's feet.\nGently roll the patient back onto her back and over the bedpan. Hold the bedpan close to the patient's body as you work.\n14. Raise the head of the bed.: Carefully raise the head of the bed, bringing the patient's body up into a more natural toileting position.\n15. Verify the positioning.: Ask the patient to spread their legs slightly so that you can verify proper bedpan placement.\nEssentially, you need to make sure that the bedpan is positioned securely beneath the entire area of the buttocks.\n16. Provide toilet paper.: Place toilet paper within the patient's reach. Let the patient know that it's there. \n\nYou should also provide sanitary wipes for the patient's hands.\nKeep a signal cord, bell, or similar device near the patient, too. Instruct the patient to ring the signal when finished.\n17. Step away.: Give the patient privacy as they use the bedpan. Let them know you will be back to check in a few minutes, but instruct the patient to ring for you if they finish before then.\nDo not leave the patient if doing so would be unsafe.\n18. Wash your hands and put on new gloves.: As soon as you leave the patient, you should remove your gloves and wash your hands.\nSeveral minutes may pass before you return to the patient again. Before doing so, wash your hands once more and put on a new, clean pair of disposable gloves.\n19. Return swiftly.: Return to the patient's side as soon as you receive a signal from them.\n\nBring a basin of warm water, soap, toilet paper, and sanitary cleansing cloths with you when you return.\nIf the patient does not signal to you within 5 to 10 minutes, check on their progress. Continue checking every few minutes.\n20. Lower the head of the bed.: Lower the head of the bed as much as possible without making the patient uncomfortable.\nThis position will make it easier for the patient to move off the bedpan.\n21. Assist the patient in moving away.: If the patient got onto the bedpan on their own, the patient should also get off the bedpan on their own. If you need to turn the patient onto the bedpan, you will need to turn the patient off.\n\nIf the patient can lift independently:\n\nAsk the patient to bend their knees.\nInstruct the patient to raise their lower half. Place your hand beneath the lower back to offer gentle support.\n\n\nIf the patient cannot lift independently:\n\nHold the bedpan flat on the bed so that it does not spill.\nSimultaneously roll the patient to the side facing away from you.\n22. Slide the bedpan away.: Slide the bedpan from its current position and allow the patient to rest. \n\nWork carefully and avoid sliding the bedpan against the patient's skin while removing it.\nCover the bedpan with a towel and set it aside for the time being.\n23. Clean the patient.: Determine whether or not the patient needs assistance with getting clean. If not, you will need to clean the patient.\n\nClean the patient's hands with a wet, soapy washcloth or sanitary wipes.\nClean the patient's bottom half with toilet paper.  For female patients in particular, wipe from front to back to reduce the risk of contaminating the urinary tract with bacteria from the rectum.\n24. Clean the area.: Once the patient is clean, remove the waterproof covering or towel.\n\nIf a spill or other contamination occurs, you will need to change the bed linens and the patient's gown or clothing immediately.\nIf there is an odor in the room, consider spraying an air freshener.\n25. Return the patient to a comfortable position.: Help the patient shift back into a comfortable resting position.\nIf necessary, raise or lower the entire bed or the head of the bed to keep the patient more comfortable.\n26. Observe or record the contents.: Take the bedpan to the bathroom and check its contents.\n\nLook for anything unusual, like streaks of red, black, or green, as well as mucus or diarrhea.\nIf necessary, measure and record the output.\n27. Dispose of the contents.: Empty the contents of the bedpan into the toilet and flush them away.\n28. Clean or replace the bedpan.: Unless the bedpan is disposable, you will need to clean it thoroughly before storing it. \n\nFlush out the contents of the bedpan with cold water. Pour this water into the toilet.\nScrub the bedpan with cold, soapy water and a toilet brush. Rinse it with additional cold water, and dump the water into the toilet.\nDry the bedpan and return it to its proper storage position when done.\n29. Wash your hands.: Remove your gloves and wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap. \n\nYou should wash your hands for a full minute, if not longer.\nOnce everything is clean, you can return the room to its standard condition by opening curtains, windows, and doors that were closed for the procedure.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

However, Beauty and her brothers, Robert and Nathan, are able to adapt to the change. News arrives that one of the ships survived and has arrived at the city harbor. Beautys father is to receive the shipment; Alicia and Pauline ask for expensive gifts, but Beauty asks for small rose.

One night after dinner, the beast asks Beauty if she should like to be his wife. Beauty gently turns him down, but the beast insists that he will grant her anything in the world to please her. Beauty asks if she will be allowed to return her home and see her family for a week. The beast agrees, but warns that if she stays away for longer than a week, he will die of sorrow. The beast gives her a magic ring that she need only twist to be taken to her family. That night Beauty twists the ring and goes to bed. She dreams of the sinister fairy again, who tells her that this is her chance and that she must let the beast die for her own sake.

But Syrian Transport Minister Mahmoud Saeed accused Turkey of carrying out \"air piracy\" and breaking civil aviation agreements. \n  \n Turkey has already imposed an arms embargo on Syria, and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said it was determined to stop any transfer of weapons to Syria through its airspace. \n  \n The foreign ministry said there was \"no basis\" for safety concerns and that \"all measures were taken to ensure the safety of all passengers and to cater to their possible needs\". \n  \n Since the uprising against Syria President Bashar al-Assad began last year, Russia has repeatedly refused to abandon its support for Damascus, while Turkey has been a vocal critic of the Assad government. \n  \n The BBC's James Reynolds, near the Syrian border in southern Turkey, says that despite taking opposite views, Ankara and Moscow have maintained a close relationship and continued to do business together. \n  \n This incident could be the biggest test of their ties since the conflict broke out, he adds. \n  \n In another sign of deteriorating relations, Turkish officials revealed on Thursday that Syria had stopped buying electricity from its neighbour last week. \n  \n In Syria itself, a huge explosion hit near a state security building in the centre of Damascus on Thursday. \n  \n State media said two people had been injured in the attack, which it blamed on \"terrorists\". \n  \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist network, said 92 government soldiers had died on Thursday, reportedly the highest death toll for the Syrian army on a single day since the conflict began. ||||| Anti-regime activists say jihadist fighters linked to al-Qaida fought with rebels to capture a Syrian military air defense base near Aleppo. \n  \n  \n  \n Videos posted online Friday, apparently shot inside the base, indicate that a group called Jabhat al-Nusra participated in the overnight battle for the base. The videos show fighters inspecting lines of large missiles. \n  \n  \n  \n Jabhat al-Nusra, or the \"front for the protection of the people of the Levant,\" is a jihadist group with links to al-Qaida. The group has claimed responsibility for a number of bombings since the start of the Syrian uprising. \n  \n  \n  \n Two Aleppo-based activists and Rami Abdul-Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, also said Jabhat al-Nusra fought in the battle. \n  \n  \n  \n According to One of the activists, Mohammed Abu Omar, four rebels were killed in the overnight battle. \n  \n  \n  \n Syria is dotted with air defense bases built for use in possible wars with Israel. Rebels have stormed such bases before but have not succeeded in deploying their complex weapons. \n  \n  \n  \n The base's capture is sure to fuel fears that Islamic extremists are playing a greater role after nearly 19 months of unrest in Syria. Western powers cite their presence as a reason not to arm the rebels. \n  \n  \n  \n Turkey scrambles fighter jets to Syrian border \n  \n  \n  \n Meanwhile, Turkey scrambled two fighter planes to the border with Syria on Friday after a Syrian military helicopter bombed the Syrian border town of Azmarin, a Reuters witness said. \n  \n  \n  \n There has been intense fighting between rebels and Syrian government forces this week in Azmarin and neighboring towns, an area strongly opposed to President Bashar Assad's rule. \n  \n  \n  \n Shells fired onto the town from surrounding hills sent thick plumes of smoke and dust rising into the air during fighting on Thursday and a voice amplified through loudspeakers, audible from the village of Hacipasa in Turkey's Hatay province, called on rebel fighters to surrender, warning of an air assault. \n  \n  \n  \n Fighting along Turkey's 900-km (560-mile) border with Syria has repeatedly spilled over into Turkish territory in the past week, with the Turkish army responding in kind to gunfire and mortar shells fired from Syria. \n  \n  \n  \n Turkish Chief of Staff General Necdet Ozel said on Wednesday his troops would respond \"with greater force\" if the shells continued to land on Turkish soil, and parliament last week authorized the deployment of troops beyond Turkey, heightening fears that Syria's civil war would drag in regional powers. \n  \n  \n  \n Syrian opposition activists estimate more than 32,000 people have been killed since March 2011, when the uprising against Assad's regime began. ||||| BEIRUT Rebels battled to hold onto Syria's main north-south highway on Friday as government forces fought insurgents on several fronts across the country. \n  \n The rebels captured an air defense base east of Syria's biggest city, Aleppo, and government forces unleashed air strikes and artillery bombardments on the western city of Homs, activists said. \n  \n On the Turkish-Syrian border, Turkey scrambled two fighter jets after a Syrian military helicopter bombed the Syrian border town of Azmarin, the site of fierce fighting between rebels and government forces this week. \n  \n Tensions between Ankara and Damascus are worsening at a time when the 19-month-old conflict is intensifying with no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough and growing concerns that the violence could spread across the Middle East. \n  \n The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll for Thursday of more than 260 people, including civilians and combatants on both sides, as fighting raged in the capital and the north, west and east of the country. \n  \n It said 92 soldiers had been killed on Thursday, one of the highest daily tolls on the government side since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad broke out in March 2011. \n  \n The official SANA news agency also reported fighting nationwide and said dozens of rebels, which it called \"mercenary terrorists\", had been killed. \n  \n In Idlib, activists said opposition fighters captured about 400 soldiers and loyalist militiamen this week in Western Jisr al-Shoughour, a hilly agricultural area. \n  \n Photos released by the opposition showed dozens of uniformed soldiers sitting on the ground in what appeared to be a hangar. \n  \n \"Around 400 loyalist troops have been captured. Many of them were poor conscripts who were let go. The more important officers are being interrogated,\" a rebel source said. \n  \n The reports could not be independently verified but they indicate an intensifying conflict, with the daily body counts of the past few weeks far exceeding previous months. \n  \n HIGHWAY HELL \n  \n The British-based Observatory, which has a network of monitors in Syria, reported fighting at a military barracks close to Maarat al-Nuaman, a town on the highway from Homs to Aleppo in the northwest. \n  \n Aleppo, Syria's commercial hub, has been contested since July and the rebel capture of Maarat al-Nuaman this week cut the main route for Assad's military to resupply and reinforce it. \n  \n Opposition sources said rebels on Thursday halted an armored army column at Khan Sheikhoun which had been sent from Hama to retake Maarat al-Nuaman, 70 km (40 miles) south of Aleppo. They also reported artillery barrages along the highway between Khan Sheikhoun and Maarat in the past 72 hours. \n  \n SANA said government forces were trying to clear Aleppo's Karm al-Jabal area of rebels on Friday. \n  \n More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which started out as a popular uprising against four decades of Assad family rule and domination by their Alawite sect and then spiraled into civil war. \n  \n Fighting has also spilled over its borders into Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, stoking fears that the war could drag in its neighbors. \n  \n Since Syrian bombardments hit Turkish villages last week, Ankara and Damascus have squared off militarily and rhetorically, with Turkey moving troops to the border and threatening to retaliate if there is further cross-border bloodshed. \n  \n Turkey infuriated Syria on Wednesday when it forced a passenger plane flying from Russia to Syria to land in Ankara. Turkish authorities said it was carrying Russian-made munitions for the Syrian army, a charge denied by Damascus and Moscow. \n  \n Turkey allows rebels sanctuary on its soil and has led calls, along with Western powers and Gulf Arab states, for Assad to step down. The Syrian president counts on the support of Russia and Iran. \n  \n Despite the bluster, most analysts believe that neither Syria nor Turkey want matters to get out of hand. The United States and European powers have also shown no desire to intervene militarily, despite much hand-wringing over the bloodshed. \n  \n HOMS UNDER FIRE AGAIN \n  \n Assad's forces also ramped up air strikes and artillery barrages against Homs on Friday, a day after they took heavy losses trying to overrun the rebel-held Khalidiya district, opposition activists said. \n  \n \"There are 50 bodies of soldiers and shabbiha (militia) on the streets in Khalidiya and regime troops cannot retrieve them,\" said Ahmad Tarkawi, a local opposition leader. \n  \n \"The situation remains tough. The regime is now using a multiple rings tactic to surround Homs.\" \n  \n Homs, 140 km (90 miles) north of Damascus, was the focus of world attention in February when a government siege pulverized rebel-held districts and killed hundreds of fighters and civilians. It is also a gateway to the mountains overlooking the Mediterranean, heartland of Assad's minority Alawite sect. \n  \n Video footage showed a six-storey building in Khalidiya flattened by an airstrike. \n  \n Shelling and aerial bombardments also hit Sunni Muslim towns near Homs to prevent rebels in the countryside from joining the battle for Homs, opposition activist Abu Yazan said. \n  \n Meanwhile, the refugee crisis grew ever more acute, with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR saying that between 2,000 and 3,000 people were fleeing across borders every day from Syria. \n  \n The total number of refugees now stood at more than 340,000, Melissa Fleming, a UNHCR spokeswoman, said in Geneva. \n  \n \"And now into the winter months, more and more of these people are going to be living in camp situations. So more and more of these people are going to be spending the winter in tents,\" she said. \n  \n (Additional reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva, Jonathon Burch on the Turkish border and Khaled Yacoub Oweis in Amman; Editing by Louise Ireland) ||||| At least 2 of the 12 French Islamists arrested in raids on Saturday were planning to join jihadists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and to recruit others to do so, a French prosecutor said Thursday. Five of the 12, all born in France and between the ages of 19 and 25, were released Thursday, but seven were kept in detention as the counterterrorist police continued to investigate a cell of Islamists that tried to blow up a kosher grocery store last month in Paris and had munitions, bomb-making equipment and a list of Jewish organizations in their possession. The prosecutor, François Molins, who called the group “extremely dangerous,” said two of them had visited Egypt and Tunisia recently, and said of the grocery bomb, “The intent was to kill.” |||||\"\nIn this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.", "output": "Syrian rebels, fighting alongside Islamist militants, captured a regime air defense base near Aleppo today after an overnight battle, Haaretz reports. The group, dubbed Jabhat al-Nusra, has ties to al-Qaeda, and has claimed responsibility for a number of bombings since the uprising began. Rebels were also fighting today to hold Syria's main northeastern highway, Reuters reports, while the government launched air strikes and artillery attacks in Homs. In other Syria news: Yesterday was reportedly the bloodiest yet for regime forces, with as many as 92 soldiers killed. It was a fairly bloody day for everyone else as well, with more than 260 estimated killed nationwide. France has revealed that two of the 12 Islamists it arrested last weekend were allegedly planning to join jihadist groups in Syria, the New York Times reports. The incident echoes Britain's arrest of two alleged extremists who had helped the rebels. The Syrian regime is vigorously denying Turkey's accusation that there was Russian-made weaponry hidden aboard a passenger plane intercepted yesterday, the BBC reports. They said Turkey had invented the weapons \"to justify his government's hostile attitude towards Syria.\" He called on Turkey to produce the weapons. Russia has denied the report as well, and is pressing Turkey for details, the New York Times reports.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "How does the muscarinic type 3 receptor (M3R) regulate the remyelination process in multiple sclerosis (MS)? Respond in 17 sentences.", "output": "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Remyelination, the spontaneous regeneration of the fatty insulator in the brain that keeps neurons communicating, has long been seen as crucial to the next big advance in treating multiple sclerosis (MS). However, a lack of understanding of how remyelination is stymied in the disease has hampered these efforts.\nNow, University at Buffalo researchers have found that a receptor called muscarinic type 3 (M3R), a key regulator of the remyelination process, is a promising drug target. M3R is a muscarinic receptor found on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the cells that make myelin.\nThe finding is likely to generate some interest in the pharmaceutical world, since other muscarinic receptors have also been found to be involved in animal models of demyelinating diseases.\n“Our data provide evidence that a drug targeting M3R specifically would be a useful strategy,” said Fraser J. Sim, PhD, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB and senior author on the paper describing the work.\nPublished in late June in the Journal of Neuroscience, the research builds on work the team published in 2015 demonstrating that MS occurs when OPCs are unable to mature and differentiate properly. They found that activation of M3R blocked differentiation of OPCs into myelin-making cells.\nIn that paper, the researchers reported that a drug already on the market for overactive bladder successfully inhibited that receptor, allowing for remyelination to occur in an animal model.\n“That work identified solifenacin as a possible drug useful for remyelination, but we really weren’t sure which specific receptor the drug worked on,” said Sim. Since the drug wasn’t specific to a signal receptor, he said it could produce unwanted side effects in patients.\nTo single out which receptor was responsible for blocking remyelination, the UB team took a genetic approach to blocking expression of M3R in both human and mouse myelin-making cells. The result was that they prevented OPCs from making M3R at all.\nFunding for the research came from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the NIH, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Kalec Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, the Change MS Wellness Foundation, the Skarlow Memorial Trust and the Empire State Stem Cell Fund through the New York State Department of Health.\nThe first authors on the paper are R. Ross Welliver, a medical student, and Jessie J. Polanco, a doctoral neuroscience candidate, both in the Jacobs School. Other UB co-authors are Richard A. Seidman, Anjali K. Sinha, Melanie A. Obara, Zainab M. Khaku, Diara A. Santiago Gonzalez, M. Laura Feltri and Pablo M. Paez.

{"input": "Give me 14 steps to create icons.", "output": "Customizing your icons is a great way to add personality to your desktop! Make your computer feel more “you” with the help of an editing software. This tutorial uses GIMP, but any layer-based photo editor will work. This wikiHow article will show you how to create icons for Windows or Mac.\n1. Find or make a base image.: You can use any image file to create an icon, but it should have a resolution of at least 256 x 256 px. This will allow it to scale well between all the different icon sizes. It doesn't matter if the image contains things you don't want to include in the final icon; you’ll be erasing everything you don't want to keep!\n\nYou can create your own images from scratch using your favorite drawing software or you can use any photo, drawing, or other image file.\nIcons are square, so your image should fit well into a square. If it’s too long, the icon will likely look squished.\nIf you are creating Mac OS X icons, 512 x 512 may look better.\n2. Install an image editing program.: In order to create an icon file, you might want to use a more powerful program than MS Paint. You can use Photoshop or a free image editor. Try GIMP, Adobe Express, or Pixlr for a free editing experience.\nThis guide uses GIMP, since it’s free on all operating systems. The process is very similar in Photoshop and Pixlr.\n3. Open your image in your editor.: Open the downloaded or created image using GIMP. The image will appear in a window in the middle of your screen.\n4. Add an alpha channel.: The alpha channel is a layer of transparency. This will allow the icon to have a transparent background when you erase the parts of the image you don't want. To add an alpha channel, right-click on the layer in the Layers window on the right side of the screen. Select \"Add Alpha Channel\".\n5. Insert a Quick Mask.: The Quick Mask will allow you to easily get rid of the parts of the image you don't want to keep. To insert the Quick Mask, press ⇧ Shift+Q. A red layer will appear over the image.\nQuick Mask allows you to select part of an image. You can use a different selection tool if you prefer!\n6. Erase the mask over the part you want to keep.: Select the Eraser tool from the Toolbox window on the left side of the screen. Use the tool to erase the red layer over the part of the image you want to keep.\n\nFor example, if you have an image of a phone lying on a table and want to use the phone as the icon, erase the red layer from the phone only.\nUse the Tool Options tab in the Toolbox window to adjust your eraser size. You can also zoom in to ensure that you erase exactly what you want.\nWhen you erase the mask, you will only be removing the mask, not the image beneath it.\n7. Toggle the mask.: Once you are finished clearing the mask off of the part you want to keep, press ⇧ Shift+Q again to toggle off the mask view. The part of the image that you erased will be selected.\n8. Delete the background.: Press Ctrl+I or go to Select → Invert. This will select everything in the image except the part you erased the mask off of. Press Del to delete the selection, leaving just the subject of your icon.\n9. Change the canvas size.: Click Image → Canvas Size. In the window that appears, click the chain icon to unlink the width and the height. Change the canvas size to a size that shows the subject well, and ensure that both width and height are set to the same number.\n\nUse the Offset values to center the image in your new canvas before clicking the Resize button.\nOnce you've resized the image, right-click on the layer and select \"Layer to Image Size\". This will change the layer boundary to match the canvas size.\n10. Adjust the color.: If you want, you can use GIMP's color tools to change the coloration of the image. The easiest way to do this is to click Color → Colorize and then adjust the settings until you find the color you feel looks best.\n11. Create the different icon sizes.: The final step in creating an icon is ensuring that the image supports all the different icon sizes. This is essential if you want to be able to use the icon in different areas of the operating system and want them to scale when icon size is increased or decreased.\n\nDuplicate the layer 5 times. Right-click the original layer in the Layers window and select . Repeat this until you have 4 copies of the original layer, 5 layers total.\nScale the original layer. Right-click the layer and select . Change the image scale to 256 X 256 px. Then click Image → Fit Canvas to Layers. (Note: if you are creating the icon set for OS X, start with a 512 X 512).\nScale the 4 copied layers to the following sizes:\n\n128 X 128\n48 X 48\n32 X 32\n16 X 16\n12. Examine your layers.: You should have 5 layers, each one with an image smaller than the last. If any of them look blurry, open the Sharpening Tool by clicking Filters → Enhance → Sharpen. Adjust the slider until the image is clearer.\n13. Save the image as an icon.: Click . In the Export Image window, change the extension in the top field to \".ico\" and choose a location to save the icon. A window will appear, asking if you want to compress any of the layers. Check the box to compress the two biggest layers, unless you are using Windows XP.\n14. Use the icon.: Once you've exported the image into .ico format, you can use it to replace the icon for any file or folder you'd like.\n\nCheck out our guide for changing the icons on Windows.\nSee our guide on changing the icons on your Mac OS X computer. You might need to use a free online converter to change the ICO file to an ICNS file (Mac's icon file format).\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Can you explain the truth about contrails and chemtrails?", "output": "No, those jet streams are not directions from our alien overlords.\nAn April Fool’s Day prank by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk went off the rails last week when Musk suggested the streams of fog trailing jets were aliens offering directions on teleporting.\nWe’re here to say: No, that’s not true.\n“Chemtrails” is actually just a play on contrails, the white stuff that lingers after a plane flies by (condensation trails, get it?). Conspiracy theorists concocted the idea that contrails were actually a geoengineering scheme to release aerosols into the atmosphere to shield the planet from incoming solar radiation and reduce the effects of climate change. Others believe aerosols are harmful chemicals that are slowly contaminating our food and water, perhaps even causing brain damage.\nBut science comes to the rescue by debunking the idea of chemtrails.\nContrails are caused by condensation built up within jet engines. As they reach higher, colder, and wetter altitudes, they leave behind a cloud, much like exhaling warm breath on a cold winter day. And the wetter the atmosphere is, the longer the contrail sticks around. It’s a common misconception that contrails immediately dissipate, or at least, they used to. Historical records show that the streams were in the sky long before our generation, but there wasn’t enough atmospheric science to understand them.\nIn a 2005 article, scientists from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics in Germany found that not only are contrails persistent in colder, more humid climates, they may actually also be contributing to the warming of the atmosphere — defeating the whole idea of chemtrails reducing climate change.\nThough contrails are generally seen in cooler climates, Earth’s atmosphere can get surprisingly chilly. A British study from 2012 explored contrails at different altitudes to see if height played a role in their creation. What they concluded was that flying higher does not produce fewer contrails, no matter what region you’re in. And even in arid regions, they can persist: In Los Angeles — where contrails are rare — there is an entire time period known as “contrail season,” when for a few short weeks there’s enough moisture in the air for planes to produce them.\nSure, contrails create a grid, not because of a greater alien conspiracy but rather because there is a constant stream of flights crisscrossing the sky at different altitudes (see below). Contrails may also appear curved because, well, the earth is not flat.\nAmerican Airlines Flight Map Across the U.S.\nSome conspiracy theorists believe that contrails contain aluminum, barium, strontium, and other bits of radioactive materials that could be causing a wide range of diseases like cancer, infections, and even brain damage. While jet engines do emit soot, the science doesn’t quite add up. For one thing, aluminum is everywhere. It makes up 7.5 percent of Earth’s crust and there are trace amounts in water, food, even our bodies — it’s a naturally occurring element. As for areas that have high levels of aluminum? The root cause is much more likely to be drilling and mining operations. In locations with acid mine drainage, for example, there can be toxic levels of several metals, including aluminum. In a 2001 report, the Tennessee Valley Authority inspected the mineralogy of three wetlands and found that the wetlands had high levels of aluminum in both the water and plants.\nContrails are actually destructive to the environment, but not in the ways that conspiracy theorists suggest — and they’re definitely not encoded messages from aliens, either.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What is the story behind the monkey selfie?", "output": "A US appeals court debated whether or not a monkey can own the copyright to a selfie on Wednesday while the photographer whose camera captured the famous image watched a livestream of the proceedings from his home in the UK.\nDavid Slater could not afford the air fare to San Francisco to attend the hearing on Wednesday. Nor can he afford to replace his broken camera equipment, or pay the attorney who has been defending him since the crested black macaque sued him in 2015, and is exploring other ways to earn an income.\nThe story of the monkey selfie began in 2011, when Slater traveled to Sulawesi, Indonesia, and spent several days following and photographing a troop of macaques. Slater has long maintained that the selfies were the result of his ingenuity in coaxing the monkeys into pressing the shutter while looking into the lens, after he struggled to get them to keep their eyes open for a wide-angle close-up.\nThe photographs became popular, and Slater said that he earned a few thousand pounds – enough to cover the cost of the trip to Indonesia. But the images became the subject of a complicated legal dispute in 2014, when Slater asked the blog Techdirt and Wikipedia to stop using them without permission.\nThe websites refused, with Wikipedia claiming that the photograph was uncopyrightable because the monkey was the actual creator of the image. The US Copyright Office subsequently ruled that animals cannot own copyrights.\nMaking a living as a freelancer is tough for any photographer, but for Slater, economic stability was once tantalizingly within reach.\nSlater has been embroiled in years of arcane legal wrangling over the nature of authorship, and said that he is “seriously on the verge of packing it all in”.\nIn 2015, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) filed a suit against Slater on behalf of the macaque, which it identified as a six-year-old male named Naruto, claiming that the animal was the rightful owner of the copyright. A judge ruled against Peta in 2016, saying that animals were not covered by the Copyright Act. Peta appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals, which heard oral arguments on Wednesday.\nAmong the points of contention were whether Peta has a close enough relationship to Naruto to represent it in court, the value of providing written notice of a copyright claim to a community of macaques, and whether Naruto is actually harmed by not being recognized as a copyright-holder.\nAt one point, Judge Carlos Bea considered the question of how copyright passes to an author’s heirs.\nThe lawyer for Slater’s publisher, which is also a defendant, also raised the question of whether Peta has even identified the right monkey – something that Slater disputes.\nThe one consolation for Slater is that he believes that his photograph has helped to save the crested black macaque from extinction.\nThe still photograph of the monkey was removed from this article on 2 August 2017, because the rights are under dispute.\nMonkey selfies and equine photobombing: who owns animal photography?\nA San Francisco court said that while the protection of law could be extended to animals, there was no indication that it was in the Copyright Act.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"Describe the process of creating artwork and how it can affect final results\".", "output": "A few years ago I had the chance to speak at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. My good friend Chris Klug, a teacher at CMU (and a great photographer) invited me speak and left it up to me to decide what I wanted to speak about and also conduct a small workshop.\nHow does process affect your final results?\nBecause of my time as in art director in the video game industry, I had thought about this often. How do I get a team of 30 on-site artists, and 200 or so more in India or China via outsourcing, work in a way that it appears that one hand created all the art for a game? Not and easy task. Defining a set process for various jobs becomes not just useful to the individual artists, but critical to budget, schedule and the success of the game.\nFor the lecture, I went though one of my paintings and showed the steps of creation, and then spoke about the process used by Bouguereau and Rockwell (and Dali, Cornwell, Leyedecker, Wyeth, Pyle, Bama, Lovell…).\nFor my workshop, I had them paint a formal portrait of a monster, or something monster-ish, in one hour. Everyone had to follow the exact same steps though.\nThe results were definitely informative. Many of those who attended were surprised at the results that they were able to achieve in such a short amount of time. None of the paintings, including mine, were book cover worthy. Of course not, they were really just sketches still, but the key point was to see how the process could change the outcome. For some in the workshop, the progress was amazing.\nNot too shabby kiddo! Especially at 9. It certainly surprised him! It gave him a whole new level of confidence. He started to see himself as an Artist! He didn't suddenly become better over night, graduating from stick figures to rendered faces. All that changed was his process. He applied tools and resources to his work that helped him see better results.\nThere are a lot of different ways to approach a painting, and as many techniques as there are artists, but I think it is useful to look at a specific approach to picture making. It was nearly abandoned through much 20th century, kept alive by a few fine artists and of course the great illustrators. It was used from the early Renaissance and is seeing a renewal again today.\nPhew! That is a lot of work. I have resisted this for a long time. How in the world could I put in that much work for one painting. If you ever find yourself wishing that you could paint as well as Rockwell or Bouguereau (I do all the time) then we should probably start with the process they used, or at least take a close look. Heck, if they were that good and they still felt that all those steps were necessary... maybe there is something there.\n1: Thumbnail sketches - Rockwell's definitely has a lot of personality already and is a little more resolved than Bouguereau's sketches. Bouguereau was originally planning a horizontal piece if the sketches here are any indication.\n2: Detailed sketch - Be sure to take a good look at that photo of Rockwell at work on the painting. Look at all the work that has gone into this piece before he set brush to final canvas. Astounding! I count 18 different head studies. I find myself in awe of his work ethic. Bouguereau as well, he as just getting started!\n3: Studies from life/photography - Both of art artists are no longer drawing from their head, but using solid reference here. Rockwell searching for the right model and face (he ended up using his wife on the left as the final model) and Bouguereau drawing from models posing in his studio.\n4: Value/color sketch - I don't have the color/value sketch that Rockwell did for this painting, but if you look at the photo of him in his studio in step 2, you can see it towards the left side, above all the head studies. For Bouguereau, I am including the sketch for Nymphs and Satyr, as well as the study for another painting so you can see one in color.\n5: Study of head/hands/feet/fabric/difficult passages - Included here are studies for three paintings from Bouguereau that show the lengths he went to to get it right. Almost as if rehearsing lines, so that for the final performance, there would be little or no stumbling. The first and third images aren't for Nymphs and Satyr, but give you an idea of what he was up to. Rockwell's studies are a lot looser than Bouguereau's, but still very informative. Rockwell would sometimes have his photographer shoot his drawings and then he would paint right over them to quickly get his colors in.\n6: Full-sized cartoon - Two beautiful drawings, done at the same size as the final and ready to be transferred to canvas. You can see that both of the cartoons have significant differences from the final paintings though. They were clearly still working things out in the final, making changes and adjustments to poses or elements of the composition.\n7: The Final Painting - Wow! Well done Mr. Bouguereau and Mr. Rockwell. All that hard work definitely paid off! I am inspired and tired.\nIs all that work worth it? Can we benefit from this in our busy hectic day and time and we use modern technology to help us go through some of these steps? I would like to think so. Check back in a couple weeks for part 2 and I will show you how I have used some modern tools applied to the steps listed above.\nIn the comments, I would love to hear your input on your own process.

The point projectiles now also break blocks, if they are powerful enough, but only tools will create block drops for natural blocks.\nThe character animation updates are progressing with a new consume animation added so you no longer mine meat.\nWe added message coalescing to the network traffic that will reduce the number of packets sent. This should help reduce latency spikes, especially on lower bandwidth connections and Wifi.\n@luke-turbulenz has been continuing to reviewing all the biomes we have made working out how best to make the next set of worlds. If you want to contribute biomes to the game, please checkout the public repository and let us know.

He’s also been looking at the creature data with a view to more balancing. In between he’s been doing more Forge design.\nRob has been mainly improving and polishing existing HUD elements this week including additional compass states and icons, an updated newsflash and status effect HUD. He’s also been looking at icons for the various sized settlements.\nHUD Updates - can you spot the changes?\nThis week @gerryjacobs has continued on the final animation pass on the hammer and tools. There’s quite a few changes to the asset structure under the hood so we will release when all is fully complete.\nGive me that orange and purple gleam! I love those gleam trees. They look awesome. I’m actually thinking of replicating something along those lines in my courtyard.\nAs for the UI updates. I’m loving the look, but will your coin always be visible in the top right? I don’t think it’s something that constantly needs to be displayed on your screen.\nOMG amazing, can’t wait I really can’t bring myself to keep mining so waiting on the next update.\nHammer name is exotic Ice-breaker level 10? woah, wonder if that’s a skill thing, or a crafter ability to make higher tier hammers??\nAnd OMG is that WHITE gleam on those trees??\nExplosive darts and a level 10 Exotic Icebreaker!\nCan’t wait to see this in game!

{"input": "What rewards do you offer for backing your Pedal Lock Kickstarter campaign?", "output": "Bicycle Pedal. Bicycle Lock. Bicycle Alarm. Unforgettable, Built-In Bicycle Security. Why Pedal Anything Else?\nTraditional locks are time-consuming and easy to forget and lose. People have to store their locks around the frame of their bikes, attach them to carriers, or throw them in their backpacks. Then they have to find and use their key or combo to unlock it, un-wrap or detach it, re-wrap or attach the lock around something secure, and then lock it all over again.\nWith all the fuss it's no surprise that the number one reason bikes are stolen is because they are simply left unlocked. Statistically, the number one location for bike theft in the United States is outside of convenience stores. People don't like going through the whole locking process, especially when they're just stepping away for a couple minutes.\nThe Pedal Lock is an efficient solution to this dilemma. With the Pedal Lock you simply pull it out and lock it up. That's when the alarm sets. Two steps and done. After you are finished, you just unlock it and it zips back in automatically. One step and done.\nThe Pedal Lock is currently made with a 33 inch long, 2.4 MM thick galvanized steel aircraft cable with our rubberized cut and kink resistant coating. Although cables like this are already being used by other lock makers, ours is the first and only retractable lock conveniently housed inside the pedal.\nTo push even further we had our team of engineers add a high decibel alarm. Now If anybody tampers with your lock or bike the loud alarm will sound immediately.\nReplace your ordinary pedal with a Pedal Lock and you will never have to worry about losing or forgetting your lock again. Set your easy to remember combination as many times as you like.\nThe Pedal Lock is kid tested and parent approved. Children love how the Pedal Lock zips in and out. Locking their bike is fun now. Children can't forget it, lose it, or wait to use it!\nTogether with our engineers, manufacturer, and development team, we have fine tuned the Pedal Lock and the final production version is amazing! We have added several improvements.\nOur goal is to put Pedal Locks on bicycles all over the world, and ultimately make them standard on bikes like car alarms on cars.\nOur manufacturers are ready to go, but we need your help to move forward with the tooling and molds.

{"input": "Story: The Straw Hat Theater, nestled in Vermont’s idyllic Northeast Kingdom, was enjoying a banner season. The summer offerings, a shrewd mix of new plays and old standards, with some familiar operettas by Offenbach or Rodgers and Hammerstein thrown in for balance, routinely drew sellout crowds at each performance. Rumors that the last play to be offered, a dark comedy called, “All’s Right Now That You’re Here”, would feature a film star, increased the sense of excitement whenever summer theater fans talked about the summer’s offerings. However, Resident Director Arthur Glendon refused to comment on those rumors, rightly calculating that his non-denials would fan the rumors and continue to swell box office receipts. The current show, “Lehar’s Merry Widow”, was a perennial favorite. It made no difference that half the audience knew all of the song lyrics by heart. They could - and often did - sing along with the cast as the numbers were performed. So why was it, Arthur Glendon said to himself as he opened the day’s mail, that the theater’s bills had not been paid in full? Here, for example, was a horrendous bill from Vermont Electric and Power. It had been a warm summer, but this was northern Vermont, after all, not Jamaica! Surely the air conditioners were not on 24 hours a day! And the catering bill, which supplied snacks for the cast and food for the lodge kitchen, was too high. All told, carry-over balances from the previous month’s bills were $400. Glendon called both companies and was assured that the bills rendered were correct. The previous month’s bills had only been partially paid. Fortunately, the other bills, which also trickled in early in the month, all seemed to be in order. Then he called Basil Carmody, accountant to the Straw Hat Theater Company for years. Basil drove over to the summer theater with the account books in his briefcase. “As you know, Arthur, I pick up the cash and checks from your cashier, Martha Gilmont, every Sunday evening after the performance. I’m a season ticket holder myself and see that show every week. We count the receipts together - I sign a receipt which she countersigns, and then I deposit the money in the Vermont Enterprise Bank on Monday morning. It’s the same system that we’ve had for years. I’ve never known her to make a mistake.” “Who do you deal with at the bank?” Basil replied, “Usually Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller. He’s been with them for years.” Glendon kept pressing Basil, “Who pays the bills?” “Why, John Franklin, of course, your Treasurer.” “How does he know what the bank balances are?” “That’s easy. The Vermont Enterprise Bank is online. All John does is to log in to the account, and the information is there. He of course also has the company checkbook, which I do not. As a matter of fact, I think he - and you - are the only ones authorized to write checks for the Straw Hat Theater Company. Satisfied?” “Of course, Basil. Nothing implied. It’s just that we seem to be short, and I don’t know why. I wanted to know exactly what our procedures are, that’s all. Arthur Glendon frowned. He was not a trained investigator and didn’t want to act like one. Talking with an old, trusted friend like Basil Carmody was one thing. He couldn’t imagine calling in the local sheriff. That would really upset the entire theater staff and perhaps ruin the season. Some of the more imaginative actors might enjoy the experience, but it would not help sell tickets. Come to think of it, selling tickets wasn’t the problem! Glendon decided on a forthright approach. As soon as Martha Gilmont came into the office from her coffee break, he asked her about office procedures. “We’re just not doing as well as we should be doing, Martha. I’m trying to find out why.” She explained what he already knew, including the discounts that were offered for season tickets and the First Thursday special prices, available only with a coupon cut out from the local newspaper. She had a precise record of receipts, performance by performance. To save money the box office didn’t accept credit cards, which caused some grumbling. The proceeds were about two-thirds in cash and the rest in local checks. She even kept the coupons that were presented at the box office for ticket discounts on First Thursdays, $8 off each ticket. Each performance record was in a separate manila envelope and was countersigned by Basil Carmody. Each week, he left with her the bank receipt for the previous Monday’s deposit of cash and checks. Trying to figure out what was happening, Glendon asked Martha, “How long do you spend at the box office?” Her answer surprised him. “Until halfway through the first act. Nobody comes for tickets after that. I like to see the shows too!” “Do you make up the performance records before you leave the box office?” She turned red. “No. Everything is in the drawer, and I lock the outside door - after the performance I grab a cup of coffee and do the receipts. It’s tedious, but I’m careful. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, so I double and triple check everything!” John Franklin, the Treasurer, was surprised at the inquiry. He was by profession an actor. The few duties involved in handling the theater company checkbook were paid for by a nice stipend. He was glad to have the work, if work was the right word for writing a few checks every week. “Yes, Arthur, that’s the drill. After you see the bills, they come to me, and I write checks for payment. Of course, first I log on to the checking account at the Vermont Enterprise Bank on the office computer. And of course, I have to make sure that the checks we get have cleared before I write our own checks. That sometimes takes a couple of days. I’ll also get the monthly bank statements. The next one for this summer should be arriving in a couple of weeks.” Glendon pressed for details, “But you didn’t pay either the power company or the caterer last month in full?” John defended his actions, telling Glendon, “That’s right. There wasn’t enough money. I probably should have raised it with you, Arthur, but I thought it best to pay off all the bills I could. I thought that I could catch up this month. Is there a problem?” “I’m not sure. I hope not. I guess I’m just surprised that we aren’t doing better, given the full houses we’ve been attracting.” Lawrence Blake was a taciturn Vermonter, given to monosyllables and long silences. “Nope, I don’t handle the account any different from any other - Basil Carmody deposits the receipts on Monday mornings, and I give him a receipt. The checks come in later, of course, signed by your Treasurer. The current one is John Franklin. I saw him last year, but haven’t seen him this summer. I gather he’s got a role in “The Merry Widow”. That would be worth seeing.” Returning to the Box Office, which was an alcove with a window off the main theater office, Arthur Glendon checked the box office receipts once again. Something didn’t seem quite right. Then it came to him. As he thought, the discount coupons were xerox copies, not originals. He returned to his part of the office and sat at his desk. “This is just a one pipe problem,” he said to himself. “It wouldn’t be a great problem for Sherlock Holmes, and it certainly isn’t for me.” The trick, without solid proof, was to get reimbursement for the missing $400, and also stop the thefts from ever happening again. He was quite sure that with a low-key talk, both goals would quickly be accomplished. Who is responsible for the missing $400?", "output": "Arthur Glendon correctly suspects that the theft is an inside job. Basil Carmody and Martha Gilmont check each other’s figures. Lawrence Blake accepts the deposit, for the same amount of money. In order for the theft to succeed, the figures they certify must be inaccurate.\n\nThe discount coupons were xerox copies. Arthur Glendon grumbled at that, since only originals were allowed the discount. He reasoned that Basil would leave the coupon counting up to Martha Gilmont, who admittedly has poor eyesight..\n\nFor a thief to steal from the unattended cash box, all that was necessary was for coupons to be placed in the box, and money removed. Fifty xeroxed coupons for the First Thursday performance were put into the box, and $400 cash removed. Glendon had heard that Lawrence Blake had not seen a play that summer, and Basil Carmody’s practice was to see the Sunday evening performance. The discrepancy, however, was from the discount coupons offered for the First Thursday performance.\n\nJohn Franklin, the Treasurer, was the only insider who was in the position to make the switch after Martha had left the box office to see the rest of the show. As a company officer, he would have had access to the office key. As an actor, he could have noticed Martha’s habit of watching later acts of the play, and wondered whether the receipts were left in the box office. During a scene in which he was not on stage, Franklin told others that he was going outside for a smoke. He entered the office, made 50 copies of a genuine coupon, and switched the coupons for the money.\n\nA hint from Glendon, which stopped just short of being an accusation, led to the $400 being returned during the next performance. But this time, the receipts were locked away in the company safe, and the cash box was empty.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

You were bored one day (you’re bored every day) and decided to amuse yourself by identifying the three fastest horses in your stable. However, your personal racetrack was severely lacking in capacity, and you could only race five horses at a time. What is the minimum number of races you needed to organize to identify your three fastest horses?\nYou needed to organize seven races.\nHere’s how to organize them. First, run five full races so that each horse races once. Keep the top three from each race in contention and eliminate the bottom two. (You can’t be the third-fastest overall if you finish in fourth or fifth.) That leaves 15 horses after five races.\nSecond, race the five winners from the first step. The winner of this race is sure to be your fastest horse, so you can cement one of your top three and send that fastest horse back to the stable. The second- and third-place horses from this race are still in contention. You can eliminate the bottom two. That leaves 12 horses vying for two spots.\nBut some of these 12 don’t even need to race again. You can eliminate all the horses that finished behind the second heat’s bottom three the first time around, since they can’t be one of the three fastest horses. That’s a total of six horses you hadn’t already eliminated. And there’s one more horse to rule out: the one that raced with the second heat’s second-place finisher, but finished in third in that first heat. That’s because there are at least three horses we know for sure are faster than that horse. That leaves you with five horses vying for two spots after six races.\nFinally, race those five remaining horses. The top two are your second- and third-fastest horses. And you’re done! You can now relax and sip champagne and eat caviar on the deck of your yacht, dreaming of all the very-fast galloping you have ahead of you.\nCongratulations to 👏 Roberts Veics 👏 of Riga, Latvia, winner of last week’s Classic puzzle!\nOn the game show “The Price Is Right,” there is a segment called the Showcase Showdown. Three players step up, one at a time, to spin an enormous wheel. The wheel has 20 segments at which it can stop, labeled from 5¢ up to $1, in increments of 5¢. Each player can spin the wheel either one or two times. The goal is for the sum of a player’s spins to get closer to $1 than the other players’ sums, without going over. (Any sum over $1 loses. Ties are broken by a single spin of the wheel, where the highest number triumphs.) For what amounts should the first spinner stop after just one spin, assuming the other two players will play optimally?\nThe first player should stop with 70¢ or higher. She should spin again with 65¢ or lower.\nPlayer 3 spins the wheel and it lands on \\(A_3\\). If \\(A_3>X_3\\), he will stop, since he’s secured victory. If \\(A_3<X_3\\), he will spin again. If \\(A_3=X_3\\), his decision depends on the number of players he’s tied with. If he’s tied with one player, he’ll spin again if \\(A_3 \\leq 50\\) — that’ll give him a better than 50-50 shot of breaking the tie without going over a dollar. Similarly, if he’s tied with two players, he’d have a ⅓ chance of winning the tiebreaker, so he’ll spin again if \\(A_3 \\leq 65\\). That’s the threshold because if he spins at 65 or below, more than ⅓ of the wheel would yield a victory, so it’s worth taking the gamble.\nMoving backward one last time: Player 1 spins the wheel and it lands on \\(A_1\\). She has no idea what the number to beat will be, but she does know she has Players 2 and 3 to worry about. In this case, \\(X_1=0\\), so it’s always the case that \\(A_1>X_1\\). Given the strategies outlined above, computationally we find that Player 1 does best to spin again if and only if \\(A_1<70\\). Solver Hector Pefo walked through these calculations in detail and shared some more Python code.\nThe diagram shows four rows of matchsticks. Row 1 has one matchstick, Row 2 has three, Row 3 has five, and Row 4 has seven.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The first absentee ballots registered on the Sebastian County website at around 7:40 p.m., showing 2,563 votes for the measure and 1,408 against. While the percentages eased back throughout the course of the evening, it was never by enough to put the passage in jeopardy.\nJason Green, vice-president of human resources at ABB/Baldor and one of the business leaders who helped form the proposal along with the rest of the Citizens’ Committee, told Talk Business & Politics even though the results were unofficial, he felt “comfortable” making a statement.\nAfter that, the focus will start shifting toward workforce training, specifically the planned Career and Technology Center.\nGreen said he “had a good feeling” going into the vote because there was a “significant” effort leading up to election night on voter turnout.\n“I’m passionate about the future workforce of this community, and this is a good way to build it. With unemployment around 4%, the pool of people is much smaller than it’s ever been to draw from, and I need more students and people, who have the skill sets of the future. This shows our local companies there is a capacity of individuals we can draw from to do the jobs we need them to do, whether it be manufacturing, healthcare, or IT,” Allen said.\n“We also are grateful for the efforts of so many to get the word out about this ballot question. I am committed to ensuring that our processes and projects are characterized by the high degree of transparency that our community expects. Details about oversight processes and timelines will be shared over the next several weeks,” Brubaker said.\nThe new rate is expected to raise $120.822 million, $35 million of which will go toward district-wide safety improvements. The proposal calls for $10.365 million to secure the walls and doors of Barling, Cook, Morrison, and Woods elementary schools.\nAn additional $5.5 million would be allocated for improvements to access controls, alarms, lighting, and accessibility measures across all campuses. The Board previously agreed safety and security improvements would be priority-one for implementation. The new millage would allow these changes to be completed by the fall of 2019.\nSingled out in the proposal are Darby and Ramsey Junior High Schools, which would receive security-related renovations in the amounts of $9.664 million and $3.046 million, respectively. Those measures would finish in August 2020. The remainder of the $35 million would go toward security measures at Northside and Southside High Schools.\nThe city’s two high schools top overall spending projects as part of the millage proposal with Southside receiving the largest allocation of $43.824 million and Northside $34.696 million. The two allocations include new competition gymnasiums in the amounts of $15.579 million (Southside) and $13.499 million (Northside).\nSouthside’s gymnasium will be an extensive renovation while Northside’s would be a full replacement, and both facilities would have the capacity to hold 2,500. The earliest the two high schools would complete their planning and construction of all included projects would be August 2021.\nOther noteworthy items include a new $13.724 million Career and Technology Center featuring specialized lab spaces and classrooms for courses in healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. The estimated completion date for construction is August of 2020.\nLastly, the $825,000 in recurring expenses would go toward the district’s student device 1:1 program as part of the annual replacement cycle to ensure each student in grades 3-12 has adequate access to technological tools.

{"input": "What are the essential 11 steps to study japanese kanji easy?", "output": "1. Before you start studying, make sure you have the right tools to study kanji efficiently and effectively. The physical tools you might need are simple but essential, and will include at least:\n\nWriting utensil\nNotebook\nIndex cards\n2. There are many useful apps available apps for both iOS and Android which make studying kanji a lot more convenient, especially a dictionary app. Recommended and helpful Japanese apps include:\n\n\n\n\n\n - Dictionary app - iOS\n\n - Dictionary app - Android\n\n - Simple kanji recognizer app - Android\n\n - Translator app - iOS/Android\n\n - Flashcard app with online database of existing flashcards sets - iOS/Android\n\n - No-frills Japanese language textbook and resource - iOS/Android\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - Dictionary app with handwriting kanji feature - iOS\n\n - Kanji learning and practice app - iOS/Android\n3. Japanese kanji were first adopted over a thousand years ago from Chinese characters for use with the Japanese language. Since then, two simplified writing systems, hiragana and katana, have descended from Chinese characters. However, kanji is used with them in conjunction. Nouns and stems of adjectives and verbs are written with kanji, and there is often more than one reading of the same character.\n4. Each character can be broken up into a set of radicals which are basically simpler, smaller characters.\n\nThe radicals are simplified from standalone characters, so sometimes you may have already learned some of the radicals.\nEach radical has its own meaning.\nThese make complicated looking kanji easier to digest in simpler chunks.\n5. An effective strategy in studying is \"telling a story\" with the radicals, or coming up with a logical story between the radicals that creates the meaning of the whole kanji.\n\nFor example, the character above 男 (male), is made up of 田 (rice paddy) and 力 (power). An example story: a powerful male worker works in the rice paddy.\nMnemonics with kanji readings are also helpful.\n6. Repeating the character over and over again feels repetitive, but will build muscle memory and comfort writing kanji in general.\nMany kanji share radicals, so practicing one kanji can help you write other kanji.\n7. The cheapest, quickest way to review kanji is with flashcards. A common way is to have the kanji on one side, and meaning and reading on the back.\n\nStudy often instead of longer. Your brain benefits more from reviewing a little each day instead of marathon sessions.\nStudy kanji you aren't familiar with more often, but also studying familiar ones every once and awhile -- this is part of the proven spaced repetition system.\n8. Find others also learning kanji to offer you tips and tricks for remembering them. Also, you can hold each other accountable while you study.\n9. Make sure to keep up your studies to put the kanji in your long term memory.\n10. These can offer guided kanji practice and learning that go along with relevant vocabulary and grammar. Putting kanji into practice is an excellent way to remember them, so working through a textbook can be very helpful. Popular textbooks include:\n\n\nGenki I&II - Beginner\n\nAn Integrate Approach to Intermediate Japanese - Intermediate\n\nThe Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course: A Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering 2300 Characters - Kanji focused textbook, but contains useful help and essential vocabulary lists\n\nWaniKani - online Kanji course/game that takes uses a spaced repetition system to teach 2000+ kanji from a base knowledge of zero (paid subscription)\n11. This makes studying seem less like studying and is a more natural absorption of kanji. Start with Japanese children's books (that usually have furigana), and eventually work your way up to something more challenging like a newspaper or website. Anything that gets you using kanji will help!\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "I'm interested in learning how to make a movie projector. Could you break it down into 17 easy-to-follow steps?", "output": "1. Purchase a standard magnifying glass at a department, office supply, or dollar store. Position the magnifying glass at the edge of a sturdy table with the handle hanging off the table’s edge. Place a handsaw at the point where the handle meets the glass and apply pressure as you move the saw back and forth over the handle to remove it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use an old camera lens instead of a magnifying glass. You will not need to remove a handle if you use a camera lens. Use a lens that you will not be using on a camera anymore, as you may damage it if you attempt to remove it from your movie projector later.\nWear protective goggles and gloves when using your handsaw. Children should ask for help from an adult for this part of the project.\n2. Find an old shoebox of any size; the sturdier the box, the better. You'll want to be sure whatever device you'll be using, such as your smartphone or a tablet, fits inside of the box. If the box is made of thin cardboard and has loose sides, line the flaps with multipurpose glue and hold them down until they stick.\nIf you can, use a sneaker shoebox that is made from sturdy, thick cardboard and doesn’t have loose flaps that you need to reinforce.\n3. Stand the box up vertically so one of the small ends is laying flat on a table. Place your lens inside the box and trace around the lens with a pencil, creating a circle on your box.\n4. Use a utility knife to carefully cut along your trace line until your lens-sized circle is completely removed from the box. If you are laying your box on a surface while cutting out the hole, be careful to use a surface that you don’t mind damaging in case the utility knife slips all the way through.\nTry cutting out your hole at a workbench table or outside on the ground to avoid damaging any tables or floors with your utility knife.\n5. Take your lens and put it into the hole so that the part you look through is partially inside the box. Place pieces of duct tape around the edges of the lens where it meets the cardboard to hold it in place. Or, plug in a full hot glue gun and line the edges with hot glue instead.\nLine both the inside and outside edges where the lens meets the cardboard with tape or glue for the best results.\n6. Measure the length and width of the sides, bottom, and lid of your shoebox. Using scissors, cut pieces of black construction paper to fit all of the inside surfaces of your box. Line the edges of the paper with multipurpose glue, and one at a time, hold them in place inside your box until they stick.\nLining the inside of your box with black paper helps to make it darker and the image from your device will transfer better through the lens when you play your movie.\n7. Purchase some thick foam board from a craft store. Using your utility knife, cut the board into pieces that will fit your smartphone. Be sure to wear goggles and protective gloves when using your utility knife.\nThe 6.5 in × 4 in (17 cm × 10 cm) foam pieces will allow you to make a stand large enough for most smartphones. If you’re choosing to use a tablet device instead, you’ll need to measure the device and make a larger stand for it. Be sure that your shoebox is large enough to accommodate a larger tablet device if you want to use one.\n8. Load a hot glue gun with glue sticks and plug it in. Arrange your foam boards to create an upside down “T” with the longer edge of the standing board running along the middle of the bottom board. When the glue is hot, apply a line of glue to the bottom edge of the standing board and press it into the bottom board until it holds.\nApply more glue to both sides of where the 2 boards meet to help your stand stay secure.\n9. Cut 2 strips of double-sided tape about 6 in (15 cm) in length with scissors. Stick them lengthwise along the standing piece of your foam phone stand.\n\nUnpeel the top paper from the tape so that there is a sticky side to place your phone onto.\nTo remove any tape residue from your phone case later, wipe it with a mild solvent or degreaser after you're finished watching your movie.\n10. If you don’t already have an app for playing movies on your smartphone or tablet device, download one by going to your app store and searching “movie apps.” Popular apps to use are Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu, IMDb, or Amazon Prime.\nYou will have to create an account and pay a membership for most movie apps that don’t have ads. If you don’t mind watching ads during movies, there are some other free movie apps available as well.\n11. Go into your settings on your device. Under “Display and Brightness” there will be a bar that allows you to adjust the brightness of your device’s screen. Slide the bar down to the right to the highest end, or 100%, with your finger.\nYou need to have your device screen at its brightest possible setting because the lens of your projector will cause the image to darken a bit when it shines through.\n12. Purchase or borrow a small Bluetooth speaker so that the sound of your movie isn't muffled. Turn the speaker on, and go into your device's settings. Under \"Bluetooth\" click \"allow new connections\" and find the name of the speaker.\nClick \"connect device\" next to the name of the speaker to connect it to your device.\n13. Stick your device onto the tape of your foam stand. Place the stand with the device attached into the box at the back end away from the lens.\nLeave the lid of your shoebox off the box until after you start the movie.\n14. You will need a blank wall to play your movie, and it should be painted white or another very light color. Remove any wall decorations that would be in the way of the image when you start the movie.\n\nIf you’d like to watch a movie outside at night, you can also use the wall or door of a garage as your movie screen, since these are usually solid walls without windows.\nIf you don’t want to remove wall decorations or find a blank wall outside, you can easily attach a plain white sheet to an indoor wall with tacks or nails.\n15. Choose a movie to play on your downloaded app. Start the movie and check to see if it the picture is clear or not. If it’s not, pause the movie while you make the necessary adjustments to your projector.\n16. If your image is unclear, move the stand and device closer to the lens inside your projector until the image becomes clear. If you move it too close, the image may become blurry again.\nMove the stand and device back and forth inside your projector box until you get a clear image. Leave the stand in the spot where the image is clearest.\n17. If you’d like the movie image to appear larger on your wall, move the box back a few inches. If the image is too large for the wall, bring the projector closer to the wall.\nPlace the projector on a small table or desk in the spot where it makes the best size screen on your wall. Unpause your movie and replace the lid on your projector box while the movie plays.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Story: It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.” Who is the murderer?", "output": "Megan Brewer became pale and Whitmore was concerned she may faint. Gently, he asked, “Why did you do it?\n\nBarely audible, she asked, “How did you know? I thought with the cameras and monitors out I was safe from discovery.”\n\n“Process of elimination,” the detective answered. “First, we know Mr. Willis was killed before 7:13, because he had no umbrella or raincoat with him. That places him in the office sometime between 6:45 when Ms. Peck arrived and 7:13 when the rains hit. I know your boss is not the murderer because she is so confident of her cell phone trail she gave me her phone without asking. Mr. Kesler didn’t do it because he has a wet umbrella in his office – proving he got here after the rain began at 7:13, which I knew to be true before Ms. Peck told us. Although Mr. Ledbetter has no coat, umbrella or anything else to prove his innocence, his arrival time was 7:40. Now, in case you are wondering, yes; arrival times can be faked. But, it is very doubtful that a man of Mr. Ledbetter’s age and physical condition could overpower a younger, muscular man. So – it was you, Ms. Brewer. I believe Mr. Willis arrived early. You met him at the front at the door and escorted him up. You escorted him into Ms. Peck’s office. What I don’t know is, why did you kill him?\n\nMegan felt sick to her stomach and willed herself to stay calm. Softly, she said, “Mr. Willis has been in our office several times. I knew he had his eye on me. I was suspicious of his intentions when I found him waiting for me at the door when I arrived. I escorted him into Cindy’s office and he tried to attack me. I didn’t know what to do. We wrestled around for a few moments. Fortunately, I saw the letter carrier on Cindy’s desk and grabbed it. In desperation I stabbed him in the heart. I didn’t mean to kill him, but I panicked after I saw he was dead.”\n\nDead silence enveloped the room. Finally, she asked, “What will you do with me?\n\nWhitmore answered, “Well, we have to arrest you, but I would guess your story will check out. I believe the judge will be very lenient with a frightened person who panicked after an act of desperation.”", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain the process of versioning functions with GCC", "output": "This support is available in GCC 4.8 and later. Support is only available in C++ for i386 targets.\n4   // The default version of foo.\n25   // foo version for the AMD Family 0x10 processors.\nIn the above example, 4 versions of function foo are created. The first version of foo with the target attribute \"default\" is the default version. This version gets executed when no other target specific version qualifies for execution on a particular platform. A new version of foo is created by using the same function signature but with a different target string. Function foo is called or a pointer to it is taken just like a regular function. With the new support, GCC takes care of doing the dispatching to call the right version at runtime.\nGCC supports FunctionSpecificOpt which makes is possible to version functions. Each function can be compiled with customized target options and this is used to create function versions.\nIn this example, the declaration has no target attributes but the definition does. However, they are regarded as the same function and GCC supports attribute merging where the target attributes of the definition are merged with the declaration when the two decls are merged. Treating, the declaration as a separate function version would have broken such code.\nDetermine if two function decls with the same signature are versions.\nDetermine the assembler name of a function version.\nProcess a call/pointer to a function version.\nAre two function decls with the same signature versions?\nTwo function decls with the same signature are versions if and only if both are tagged with the function attribute \"target\" and the target attribute strings differ.\nWhat is the assembler name of a function version?\nThe only exception to this is the default version tagged with target attribute string \"default\". The default version retains the original assembler name and is not changed.\nHow to process a call/pointer to a function version?\nWhen the front-end sees a call (pointer) to a function version, it generates a new dispatcher function decl and replaces the existing call (pointer) to be a call (pointer) to the dispatcher function. The body of the dispatcher function is later generated when building the call graph. The dispatcher function has the logic to determine the right function version at runtime. At run-time, calling the function version, either directly or indirectly, will invoke the dispatcher logic which will execute the right function version.\nIs this function a version?\nFor this function version, what are the other semantically equivalent function versions?\nIs this function a dispatcher of a set of function versions?\n14      be called to execute the right function version at run-time.\nA map is created from a cgraph node to a cgraph_function_version_info struct for every function version and the associated dispatcher function. The cgraph_function_version_info structs of all the semantically identical function versions are chained as a doubly-linked list. The first version in this list is the default function. A dispatcher function has a pointer to the chain of function versions it dispatches.\nThe body of the dispatcher function for function versions is also generated when the cgraph is analyzed for needed functions. The cgraph function body contains code to call the runtime CPU check builtins to check if the CPU supports the target features to execute a particular function version. The default function version is executed if no function version is appropriate on a particular platform. To keep the cost of dispatching low, the IFUNC mechanism is used for dispatching. This makes the call to the dispatcher a one-time thing during startup and a call to a function version is a single jump indirect instruction.\nGiven a set of function versions, what is the order in which the versions should be dispatched? This is answered by assigning a dispatch priority to each function version based on the target attributes. For example, a function version targeted for SSE4.2 will have a higher dispatch priority than a version targeted for SSE2, that is, function versions with more advanced features get higher priority. The priority of the target features is determined by the target.\nWhen a function version with target attribute \"arch=<processor X>\" is compared with a function version with attribute \"<ISA Y>\", then the highest priority of the any ISA supported by processor X is compared to the priority of ISA Y to decide which version should be dispatched first. If the priorities are the same then the version with \"arch=\" is given precedence. For instance, when comparing \"arch=corei7\" and \"popcnt\", \"arch=corei7\" wins since the priority of the highest ISA supported by corei7 is popcnt.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"What are your thoughts on virtual reality?\"", "output": "Virtual reality, the opium of the people?\nThe debate has been going on for years, declined from time to time depending on the emerging technology: offer a mass market experiences that were hitherto the prerogative of a small number of rich is a good or a bad thing? Already Second Life has given millions of users the opportunity to immerse themselves in a virtual environment where owning villas and yachts, participate in “exclusive” parties and fashion shows, is extremely cheap, but there was always in the middle the screen of a computer. Now the technology seems poised to deliver devices that will make imperceptible the difference between “real” reality and virtual reality and many return to fear the risk of ending up creating a situation similar to the one described in The matrix.\nSimulating a reality usually accessible to a few could become the new opium for the people? Opinions differ. Philosopher Robert Nozick, already in 1974 hypothesized an “experience machine” able to simulate a virtual reality and had then askedm: if it existed “will we stay connected to this machine a lifetime, pre–planning our experiences?” The answer for Nozick was negative,if only because “Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality”, since “there is no actual contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated”. Perhaps, he conclued, “what we desire is to live (an active verb) ourselves, in contact with reality. (And this, machines cannot do for us)”.\n42 years later, many of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world as Sony, Google, Facebook or Microsoft, are investing billions of dollars to try to create virtual reality devices for the mass market, clearly convinced that the public does not wait but to connect to them. In fact, at least in some areas of the world, such as Asia, millions of players spend many hours online everyday “immersed” in videogames and virtual worlds like Word of Warcraft, Eve Online or Second Life, while entrepreneurs from Philip Rosedale to Luckey Palmer they are trying to achieve the vision suggested by the novelist Neal Stephenson in the novel Snow Crash, of 1992, in which around an American now controlled by large corporations, there is a “metaverse”, a 3D virtual reality shared on a worldwide fiber optic network where each user is represented by his/her own avatar, a parallel to the real world but that is able to interact with it in ways and for very specific purposes.\nHowever the idea of resorting to massive virtual reality devices still does not convince those who seek to build a better world in the realities of the of everyday life. Offer internet connections and virtual reality devices to the mass poor of the world is likely to be a new and more subtle form of colonialism, which is likely to generate reactions, once the initial excitement and illusions connected to it no longer exist. In an interview with Wagner James Au, John Carmack, author and programmer of video game graphics engine (as Doom, Quake and Rage),since August 2013 Chief technology officer of Oculus Rift, sustains, however, that those arguments are misleading.\n“If someone wanted nothing more in life than to read books -explains Carmack – providing them with a massive library is not doing them a disservice, even if that means that they are less likely to be involved in other activities”. “If people are having a virtually happy life, they are having a happy life.

With emerging stars up front (Laine, Scheifele, Ehlers), defense and goaltending likely hold the key to a post-season appearance in 2017/18.\nNOTE: For other team deep-dives and methodology explanations, feel free to click here.\n+ The Jets have a solid, young crop of puck movers. Trouba (23 years old, PMF +0.28), Morrissey (22 years old, PMF +1.81) and Myers (27 years old, PMF +1.23) are all relatively young and have shown strong ability to move the puck and elevate the play of their teammates despite facing solid QoC and playing top 4 minutes. None of the 3 appear to be sheltered either, starting roughly the same % of shifts in the offensive zone as the defensive one.\n+ Durability will be key heading into 2017/18. Only Byfuglien and Morrissey played 80+ games. Trouba (60 – although 15 from his hold-out), Enstrom (60), and Myers (11) all missed considerable time with injury.\n+ Byfuglien (PMF +1.39) was his usual strong self as a puck mover in 2016/17.\n+ While Enstrom struggled to drive possession (PMF -1.04), his defensive ability metric (DAM +1.31) was best on the team at minimizing scoring chances and keeping high danger shots to a minimum.\n+ Postma was solid both as a puck mover (PMF +0.38) and defensively (DAM +1.02), but did so against very weak competition.\nByfuglien and Trouba lead the way on the power play. As a QB, Byfuglien was the best for Winnipeg. His PPQB of +1.50 is well above league average, highlighting his ability to maintain possession, generate good scoring chances, and create offense with the man advantage. Byfuglien led the way with 2.17 primary assists per 60 minutes of PP time – tops on the team and among the best in the league.\nAs a shooter, Trouba was tops. His PPGS of +1.35 of goals per 60 on the PP of 1.22 are both in the upper quartile of the league.\nThe Winnipeg Jets are an interesting team to watch heading into 2017/18. They’re loaded offensively (Laine, Scheifele, Ehlers, and Wheeler all put up 60+ points) and appear to be very solid on defense, so what is holding them back?\nTheir biggest issue might be goaltending. Winnipeg ranked 27th out of 30 teams in terms of 5v5 save percentage. That is not strong. Unless they see improvement from that position, it might be tough for the Jets to be more than a bubble playoff team in 2017/18.\nThat said, if goaltending does improve, and their blue line proves more durable in 2017/18, this could be a dangerous, young team ready to make their mark in the post-season.\nTrouba did not miss games due to injury. He missed 20 games because he was holding out on a contract and the other 2 were due to a suspension.\nHe missed 15 games from the hold-out, 5 games from injury.

You might be able to get an answer based on experience, or on what the manufacturer has stated is the estimated time, but the answer won't be particularly useful.\n\nIf we put the above issues aside, I have to say that shipping times for anything (IoT or not) probably isn't something that we should accept here - I don't feel that it's really relevant to the Internet of Things.\nOn the other hand, questions about using sensors and connected devices to optimise shipping is, in my opinion, a great topic under the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). I'd be interested to see something asked about that in future.\nSo, in conclusion, I believe we should make delivery predictions off-topic, because it's not relevant to our scope and we simply can't provide a good answer, so we're doing users a disservice if we encourage them to ask about things we can't answer properly.\n\nA:\n\nYou might just as well ask 'I backed this kickstarter, will it ever ship'.

This question is a bit problematic.\n\nIt's hard to make predictions, especially about the future. - Niels Bohr\n\nWhy I think it should be off-topic\nThe problem is that we can almost only guess. The only one who might be able to answer kinda authoritatively is the manufacturer. Users would only be able to tell how long it took for them to get a shower, which depends on dozens of factors they don't see. (Was the model delivery ready in storage? Was it individually produced? Was it exactly the one day before they ship everything they produce that month? Does the company ship everyday? Et cetera.)\nEven then the answer would be restricted to the location that user lives. Thus, the answer wouldn't be of much use to future users. Even if we had tons of users from all over the place who had ordered those showers and we had an answer for every location those answers would still be short lived because the logistic partners like FedEx and DHL they list and all their competitors basically get better faster all the time. Additionally the manufacturer could create a new plant in India for the Asian market.\nThus, shipping timetable questions are too localized in time and geography and no help to anyone in the future.\nFurthermore it's a logistics question, not an IoT question. If the same company would sell regular showers and IoT showers—let's assume for the sake of argument the shower is a viable IoT product—the shipping of those items still doesn't seem IoT for me. Not from a customer perspective.1 It's just getting item X from A to B.

On April 10 the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority otherwise known as Bafin has frozen funds connected with a Onecoin payment processor.\nA German-based company called the IMS International Marketing Services Gmbh is under scrutiny for accepting funds coming from the Onecoin organization. In a recent report, the German regulatory agency Bafin reveals they have seized funds in excess of €29m from the IMS firm. The agency states that IMS raked in a total of €360m from the MLM based company Onecoin Ltd., for over a year.\nBafin says Onecoin is part of a vast network of marketing agencies selling virtual units the company declares as a cryptocurrency. The financial regulator says the Onecoin MLM scheme is used in Germany and across the world by many people. However, Bafin calls IMS an “unauthorized money remittance business,” and the company is in violation of sentence 4 of the German Payment Services Supervision Act.\n“In its decree of 5 April 2017, BaFin ordered IMS International Marketing Services GmbH to immediately cease and wind down its unauthorized money remittance business with investors in “Onecoin” for Onecoin Ltd.,” explains the German supervisor’s office.\nIn case IMS should not abide by the order to cease business, Bafin threatened to impose a coercive fine of 1.5 million euros; for non-compliance with the winding-down order, it will also impose a coercive fine of 150,000 euros.\nFor a highly detailed report on Onecoin’s sketchy MLM practices and proof the virtual token is not a cryptocurrency check out our popular Onecoin expose’ here.\nOnecoin and its associated companies have been under investigation in Germany before. Bafin started investigating Onecoin in June of 2016 due to solicited investments through the German bank Commerzbank AG.

Furthermore, the alleged Ponzi scheme has been frowned on by government authorities in Belgium, Nigeria, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and many more countries.\nBafin says they don’t have the power to decide whether or not Onecoin tokens are valid under civil law. However, operations will be investigated says the regulatory agency and “orders may still be subject to judicial review.” Although they can’t legally define Onecoin’s business practices at the moment, Bafin can shut down unauthorized remittances.\n“On behalf of Onecoin Ltd, IMS International Marketing Services had investors who had bid to buy “Onecoins” and transfer the sales to various accounts held by IMS International Marketing Services with different banks in Germany and forwarded the money on behalf of Onecoin Ltd to third parties, based in particular outside of Germany.

We will be hiring more people soon.\nIs this too early to create and implement a project management process, or should it wait until the team is bigger?\n\nA:\n\nWhile I can't give you a specific idea about it being too early, I'd suggest strongly making sure that your team fully appreciates the concepts of agile development and also wants to have a useful process in place.\nRight now I am working on a team of 4.5 (3 full stack devs, an intern, and me, the PM/BA).  I wanted to get us started with the agile concept early on, because the entire point is shrinking the feedback loop.\nWhether you use scrum or some other flavor of agile, having an established process helps when new people come on board, so they know what is expected of them.  It's a concept explored quite readily in this book: http://www.amazon.com/Team-Geek-Software-Developers-ebook/dp/B008EKF87S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382398521&sr=8-1&keywords=team+geek\nBasically, the faster you can establish a team culture, the stronger your team will be long term.", "output": "TL;DR\nOne way to think about project management is that it isn't necessarily about adopting a specific process, framework, or set of practices. Rather, it is most often a tool for managing expectations and making sure that project-related communications are effective.\nIt is never too early to manage expectations, or to start communicating effectively. The only real question is what level of formality is necessary to achieve those goals within a given organization.\nCommunications Channels\nThe formula for determining the number of communications channels is:\n\nn * (n - 1) / 2\n\nThe complexity of managing project communications is therefore a function of the number of people involved. For example:\n\nA two-person project has only one communication channel.\nYour company currently has five people involved in the project: two developers, one devops, one manager, and one marketeer. This results in 10 communications channels.\nA full Scrum Team with a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and six development team members has 28 communications channels.\n\nYou may or may not need a formal project management process at this point, but you certainly need to start thinking about an effective communications plan for your projects.\nRigor and Overhead\nSmall teams usually don't require the same level of rigor in their process as larger teams do. That doesn't mean controls aren't present in the process; it just means that they are often less stringently applied in order to make them less time-consuming.\nThe rigor of a process is typically correlated with the amount of process overhead. For example, a formal Scrum process using a two-week sprint usually consumes around 30% of available man-hours in framework overhead. In contrast, a simple communications plan where everyone on the team simply posts a status report on the wiki once a week consumes less than 3% in overhead.\nThe trade-off is essentially between improved communications within the organization and time spent on active development. Most projects reach a tipping point where the cost of communicating poorly or building the wrong thing is more expensive than the cost of any process overhead.\nThe tipping point will be different for each organization and each project, but my personal experience is that it's time to think about adding some rigor when:\n\nThe project involves more than three people.\nThe project requires a formal budget.\nThe tangible or intangible cost of project failure exceeds the project's budget.\n\nYour organization may have a different calculus for determining when it's time to formalize a project's controls, but every organization has to make the same essential trade-offs. It's probably not too early to start crunching those numbers for your organization and determining where that line should be drawn.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Describe the connection between Paul Wellstone and Keith Ellison as it pertains to a potential leadership change at the DNC.", "output": "The Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair argues that if Democrats stand on principle and put resources into organizing, they will win.\nThe Democratic National Committee must change, radically, if it is going to be prepared for the challenge of opposing President-elect Donald Trump and the most right-wing Congress in American history. The DNC that could not stop Trump must be replaced by a DNC that can stop Trumpism.\nWellstone spoke those words after the heartbreaking election of 1984, in which Ronald Reagan won a 49-state landslide victory that led many Democrats to imagine that their party needed to ease up on its historic commitment to economic justice and its emerging commitment to a broader vision of social justice. Wellstone argued that the naysayers were misguided, that a turn inward that betrayed the “democratic wing of the Democratic Party” represented an abandonment of the future. He was right, on so many moral and political levels.\nWellstone’s vision lives on with those who worked with him on behalf of economic and social justice and peace—and on behalf of a grassroots-focused and boldly progressive Democratic Party. One of Wellstone’s allies was a young lawyer from Minneapolis named Keith Ellison, who would become a congressman and is now emerging as a potential front-runner for the chairmanship of the DNC.\nEllison embraced the Wellstone vision in Minnesota, where both men emerged from the same Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party activist tradition. They worked together for shared goals as a sitting US senator and a young African-American community activist looking to get involved in Minnesota politics, as a college professor and a lawyer, as an veteran farm and labor organizer and a community organizer on issues of racial and economic justice, as a Jew and a Muslim who sought a more progressive Democratic Party and a more progressive local, state, and national politics.\n“Paul taught me that if you have a vision for an inclusive society, for peace and for environmental sustainability, you don’t just run to make a point, you run to win elections,” says Ellison.\nThat is what Democrats must do if they seek to mount an inspirational and effective opposition to Trumpism—and if they seek to provide a vision for the next American politics and the next America. So the prospect that Ellison, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, might bid for the chairmanship of the DNC is exciting. If he runs, Ellison will face opposition from former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who was a successful DNC chair in the period after he bid for the party’s 2004 presidential nomination, and potentially from a contender for the 2016 Democratic nomination, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley. The names of other prospects continue to be discussed, including one of the party’s ablest communicators, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm.\nEllison has for months been engaged in behind-the-scenes discussions about the future of the party, and its chairmanship. Through it all, he has argued that the party must change. He has spoken not just to Sanders backers but also to key Clinton backers, to insiders and outsiders. And he has talked a lot about the Wellstone model of constant, at-the-grassroots organizing rather than a politics of money and poll-tested talking points.\nBut Ellison is also talking about Wellstone’s other ingredient of democratic renewal: good public policy that is clearly distinguished from the conservative agenda.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Off the shelf, the programs would include copy protection routines that went so far as to modify the performance of the floppy drive, or force the Apple II’s operating system to rewrite itself to behave in strange ways.\nBecause hackers (in the “hyper-talented computer programmers” sense) would take the time to walk through the acquired floppy disks and remove copy protection, those programs are still available to use and transfer, play and learn from.\nOne side effect, however, was that these hackers, young or proud of the work they’d done, would modify the graphics of the programs to announce the effort they’d put behind it, or remove/cleave away particularly troublesome or thorny routines that they couldn’t easily decode, meaning the modern access to these programs were to incomplete or modified versions. For examples of the many ways these “crack screens” might appear, I created an extensive gallery of them a number of years ago. (Note that there are both monochrome and color versions of the same screen, and these are just screen captures, not playable versions.) They would also focus almost exclusively on games, especially arcade games, meaning any programs that didn’t fall into the “arcade entertainment” section of the spectrum of Apple II programs was left by the wayside entirely.\nWith an agnostic approach to the disks being preserved, 4am has brought to light many programs that fall almost into the realm of lore and legend, only existing as advertisements in old computer magazines or in catalog listings of computer stores long past.\nThese extensive write-ups shine a light on one of the core situations about these restored computer programs.\nAs 4am has wryly said over the years, “Copy Protection Works!” – if the copy protection of a floppy disk-based Apple II program was strong and the program did not have the attention of obsessed fans or fall into the hands of collectors, its disappearance and loss was almost guaranteed. Because many educational and productivity software programs were specialized and not as intensely pursued/wanted as “games” in all their forms, those less-popular genres suffer from huge gaps in recovered history. Sold in small numbers, these floppy disks are subject to bit rot, neglect, and being tossed out with the inevitably turning of the wheels of time.\nThis collection upends that situation: by focusing on acquiring as many different unduplicated Apple II programs as possible, 4am are using their skills to ensure an extended life and documented reference materials for what would otherwise disappear.\nAlready, the collection has garnered some attention – the “Classifying Animals With Backbones” educational program linked above has a guest review from one of the creators describing the process of the application coming to life. And a particularly thorny copy protection scheme on a 1982 game of Burger Time went viral (in a good way) and was read 25,000 times when it was uploaded to the Archive.\nIn a few cases, the amount of effort behind the copy protection schemes and the concerned engineering involved in removing the copy protection are epics in themselves.\nAs an example, this educational program Speed Reader II contains extensive copy protection routines, using tricks and traps to resist any attempts to understand its inner workings and misleading any potential parties who are duplicating it. 4am do their best to walk the user through what’s going on, and even if you might not understand the exact code and engineering involved, it leaves the reader smarter for having browsed through it.\nThis project has been underway for years and is now at the 500 newly-preserved program mark – that’s 500 different obscure programs preserved for the first time, which you can play and experience on the archive.\nThis entry was posted in Emulation, Software Archive.

{"input": "\"Background Paragraph: Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front.\"\n You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

She has vivid memories of walking into In Other Words for the first time, seeking books for her first women’s studies class.\nSchwisow had attended a small, private high school and grew up in a conservative community.

While Soros’ Open Society Foundation does offer grants to individuals and organizations to work on specific projects related to civil liberties and criminal justice reform, there is no evidence that he has ever paid protesters to be in the streets. Yet while introducing SB5009, Washington Senator Doug Eriksen specifically named Soros, as well as the Sierra Club, as intended targets of the legislation. Another protest myth is clearly behind one measure in Georgia’s package of pro-policing laws—SB160 creates a new felony offense for protesters who throw “human or animal excreta” at police during demonstrations (a claimed occurrence that has often been cited in policing manuals and yet has no evidence to back it up).\nThe recent surge of legislation targeting protesters and protest organizers is not the first time state legislators have attempted to neutralize and punish effective protests. The Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) was proposed in 2003 and passed by Congress in 2006. The initial proposal was followed by a series of similar but far more extreme bills at the state level. AETA ostensibly protects animal enterprises by creating the concept of “eco-terrorists”—animal and environmental activists who successfully cause a financial threat to businesses profiting from animals. This legislation explicitly tied protesting to “terrorism”, and led to the imprisonment of animal rights activists who had done nothing more than administer a website.\nThe fact that so many similar bills have been introduced—combined with the spate of news articles that do not always highlight that these are proposed bills that have not yet passed—creates an atmosphere of confusion and fear. The knowledge that these bills are being considered in many state legislatures, regardless of their status, is likely to have a chilling effect on dissent. Few people would be as willing to protest if they thought they could easily be arrested, fined, imprisoned, or even killed. The lack of clarity over where bills stand in the legislative process, the likelihood they will pass in their current forms, and the actual consequences if they do is already enough to cast doubts among those who intend to protest.\nPosted in NLG Blog and tagged Donald Trump, First Amendment, Police, Protest.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

At first glance, the black-and-red Virtual Boy looked every bit as capable as the virtual reality headsets that were popular in the 90s, promising access to stereoscopic 3D worlds from the comfort of your living room. However, Nintendo got it wrong -- really wrong. With its two-legged stand, which led to many a bad back, and uncanny ability to induce eye strain, the Virtual Boy was gamble that never paid off.\nReleased in August 1995, the Virtual Boy sold over 750,000 units during its brief life span. For some, that would be considered a success, but Nintendo was riding high from the success of the SNES, which had shifted over 20 million units by the time the 32-bit console hit North American shelves. Within six months, Nintendo had discontinued the system and shifted its focus to the development of the Game Boy Pocket and the Game Boy Color.\nEven though it's considered a failure for Nintendo, the Virtual Boy has become an intriguing collector's item for gaming enthusiasts. In this week's Tech Hunters episode, Julia Hardy tracks one down to find out more about the headset that was perhaps a little too ahead of its time.\nTech Hunters is a 10-part video series that uncovers the devices we were once obsessed with, looking at how they disrupted the tech industry, and what they're worth today.

{"input": "\"Very few Americans know how close the country came to catastrophe this week. \n  \n The final tally shows that the Senate voted by a wide margin Wednesday, 67 to 31, to break Sen. Ted Cruz’s filibuster of an increase in the debt limit, thus avoiding a default on the United States’ full faith and credit. \n  \n But 15 minutes after the voting should have ended, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had apparently secured only two of the five Republican votes he needed to join all 55 members of the Democratic caucus to pass the measure. He raised three fingers in the air and worked his way among his members but was met with folded arms and shakes of the head. Looking queasy, he patted his thigh nervously and drummed his fingers. In the hubbub, Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) knocked a full glass of water and coaster from McConnell’s desk to the floor. \n  \n Democrats, watching the spectacle, took the extraordinary step of ordering the Senate clerk not to read aloud the ongoing vote tally to avoid setting off a market panic; because the House had already left on a two-week recess, a failure of this vote would have left little chance of avoiding default on Feb. 27, when the Treasury was to run out of funds. \n  \n Watching the chaos from the side of the chamber was the man who caused it: Cruz, his hands in his pants pockets and a satisfied grin on his face. The Texas Republican strolled to the clerk’s table to check on the vote count and was met with a look of disgust from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).

He smirked as his colleagues finally overcame his filibuster after a ­59-minute struggle. \n  \n Cruz’s ego trip had come at a high cost. He had forced McConnell, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and other Republicans to cast votes that could cause them to lose primaries to weaker general-election candidates, and he had risked getting his party blamed for a default. \n  \n The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page dubbed Cruz “the Minority Maker” for making his GOP colleagues “walk the plank” on a “meaningless debt ceiling vote.” \n  \n But Cruz doesn’t care about all that. Leaving the chamber, he told reporters McConnell’s fate would be “ultimately a decision . . . for the voters in Kentucky.” \n  \n His actions suggest Cruz has put himself before his party and even the nation’s solvency. And in this sense his actions are typical of the 2016 GOP presidential field. Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Rand Paul are mucking up the gears of government in ways that will earn them favorable attention in the primaries. \n  \n Rubio, of Florida, is pushing legislation that would undo Obamacare in such a way that would cause chaos in the insurance market and likely leave tens of millions of people without health coverage and cost the government billions. \n  \n Vying with Cruz to be the most reckless of the 2016 aspirants is Paul, of Kentucky, who in recent days has injected the 1990s Monica Lewinsky scandal into the national debate as a means of discrediting Hillary Clinton. He also claimed her failure to send “reinforcements” to diplomats in Benghazi before they were attacked “should limit Hillary Clinton from ever holding high office.” Multiple investigations have confirmed that secretaries of state do not make decisions about security at each diplomatic post. \n  \n Now, Paul has politicized his court challenge to the NSA surveillance program. It would have been an important legal case, but Paul pushed aside the constitutional lawyer who had drafted the legislation and abandoned efforts to get a Democratic senator to be a co-plaintiff; instead, he added President Obama’s name to the list of defendants, brought in the tea party group FreedomWorks as a plaintiff and hired failed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, another tea party politician, to be his lead lawyer. \n  \n To nobody’s surprise, Paul and Rubio sided with Cruz in Wednesday’s debt-ceiling filibuster. Had they prevailed, and had 12 of their GOP colleagues not been more responsible, the likely default would have added far more to the national debt than the legislation did. It also would have caused markets to crash, the economy to swoon and American standing to decline. \n  \n But for Messrs.

Close \n  \n A growing group of Ted Cruz’s Republican Senate colleagues are infuriated with his tactics. \n  \n So frustrated was Arizona Senator John McCain with the latest, forcing fellow Republicans to take a politically risky vote on lifting the debt ceiling, that yesterday he tweeted a Wall Street Journal editorial accusing the Texas lawmaker of instigating “needless drama that helps to explain why Republicans remain a minority.” \n  \n Yet there’s not much McCain, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell or other Republicans can do to change Cruz’s behavior. \n  \n “In this day and age, there are no tools available to a leader to punish a member like Senator Cruz, especially because Senator Cruz doesn’t care what either the leader or the rest of his caucus thinks,” said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. \n  \n Related: \n  \n Cruz’s insistence Feb. 12 on a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation lifting the nation’s borrowing cap foiled his party leadership’s plan to let the measure move forward with only Democratic votes. He led the October fight to defund the 2010 health care law, resulting in a partial government shutdown and the party’s cratering in public opinion polls. \n  \n The Republican Party’s favorability was at a record low of 28 percent in a Gallup Poll conducted Oct. 3-6, during the shutdown. That was down 10 percentage points from the previous month and 15 points below Democrats. \n  \n Old Tools \n  \n In decades past, leaders could rein in such behavior by threatening to take away coveted committee assignments, withdrawing financial support, or shunning lawmakers. None of those tactics are effective in a political era in which campaign cash flows freely from outside the party machinery and cable outlets offer many ways to grab attention and influence. \n  \n In addition, the potential 2016 presidential aspirant who is aligned with the small-government Tea Party movement has demonstrated scant interest in cultivating Senate allies or building legislative coalitions, making him even more impervious to pressure from his colleagues. \n  \n The risk for Republicans is that Cruz will press similar votes and undermine the party’s ability to win the net six seats needed to gain control of the Senate. Republican infighting has twice, in 2010 and again in 2012, blown up its strategy for retaking the chamber. \n  \n McConnell had to vote “yes” on advancing the debt bill to bring along enough fellow Republicans -- immediately providing fodder for his Republican opponent in the state’s May 20 primary, Louisville businessman Matt Bevin. \n  \n Punishment Backfire \n  \n House Speaker John Boehner in 2012 retaliated against four Republicans who went against him on budget and spending issues, by kicking them off the Budget and Financial Services committees. The move only liberated them to speak more boldly against the leadership. \n  \n House Republican leaders this week removed Louisiana Representative Bill Cassidy from their whip team after he joined Democrats to press for a vote on legislation to prevent an increase in federal flood insurance premiums, said a Republican aide who sought anonymity. Cassidy is running against Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu. \n  \n There’s no sign that McConnell will seek to punish Cruz, whose committee assignments include Armed Services, Judiciary and Commerce, Science and Transportation, by bumping him from those panels. \n  \n Campaign Committee \n  \n Nor are there discussions of stripping Cruz of his leadership role at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, where he’s serving as vice chairman for “grassroots outreach,” said NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. \n  \n Cruz “has has been a powerful voice warning about the dangers of Obamacare and the lawlessness of the Obama administration,” Hougesen said. \n  \n The Texan hasn’t endorsed any Republican candidates in contested primaries, including those that involve incumbents, and has said he has no plans to do so. \n  \n Cruz has maintained close ties to the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee founded by former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint that has helped elect Tea Party-backed senators since 2010 and is targeting McConnell. \n  \n “We appreciate the support that he has given to our organization, and we look forward to working with him in the future,” said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the group, which helped Cruz upset Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst in the 2012 Republican primary and win his Senate seat. \n  \n ‘Conservative Principles’ \n  \n Before last year’s shutdown, Hoskins’s group posted a video on Twitter Sept. 26 congratulating Cruz “for standing up for conservative principles.” \n  \n The 90-second video is a montage of media coverage of Cruz’s bid to control the Senate floor for more than 21 hours to protest Obamacare. It opens with a narrator declaring: “Most Republicans promise to fight for conservative principles during the campaign, but then let us down after they’re elected. Ted Cruz is different. Ted Cruz delivers.” \n  \n The group, which has already spent more than $1 million this cycle, has endorsed Bevin in the Kentucky race and this week aired a web ad criticizing McConnell’s past votes in favor of debt-limit increases. \n  \n It’s also backing President Barack Obama’s second cousin, Milton Wolf, in his bid to oust fellow Kansas Republican Pat Roberts as well as Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel, who is challenging Republican Senator Thad Cochran. \n  \n Top Financiers \n  \n SCF and another Washington-based small-government advocacy group, the Club for Growth, were Cruz’s top 2012 financiers, which makes him immune to any threats from party leaders to restrict the campaign money flow. \n  \n Donors to those groups shipped Cruz $1.7 million of his total $14.5 million haul, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. The two groups provided another $7.1 million in outside advertising to help him win. \n  \n Cruz, who often begins his answers to reporters’ questions by saying “outside of Washington,” has gone out of his way to portray himself as an outsider willing to challenge the White House and his party’s establishment. \n  \n Asked this week whether McConnell should be replaced as Senate Republican leader, Cruz dodged a chance to buck up his leader and said that was a decision “for the voters of Kentucky to make.” \n  \n Obama, speaking to House Democrats today in Cambridge, Maryland, credited unity among his party’s lawmakers with staving off spending cuts or other conditions some Republicans including Cruz wanted to attach to a debt-limit increase. \n  \n ‘Stick Together’ \n  \n “The fact that we were able to pass a clean debt limit is just one example of why when you guys are unified, you guys stick together, this country is better off,” Obama said. \n  \n For their part, Senate Republicans are “getting used to Senator Cruz’s style of operating, which is to continue to put them in very difficult positions,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. “He is in it for a variety of reasons, but most likely in it for his future presidential ambitions.” \n  \n To contact the reporter on this story: Kathleen Hunter in Washington at khunter9@bloomberg.net \n  \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jodi Schneider at jschneider50@bloomberg.net ||||| The Senate passed the House debt-limit increase on Wednesday, but not before some needless drama that helps to explain why Republicans remain a minority. \n  \n Democrats had enough votes to pass the increase with a simple majority, which means they would have owned the debt increase.

Humanity has unleashed its own version of “life” on Earth, a sui generis genus that is evolving in ways that are fascinatingly similar to biological organisms.\nRoboticists are honing their robots by essentially mimicking natural selection. Keep what works, throw out what doesn’t, to optimally adapt a robot to a particular job. “If we want to scrap something totally, we can do that,” says Nick Gravish, who studies the intersection of robotics and biology at UC San Diego. “Or we can take the best pieces from some design and put them in a new design and get rid of the things we don't need.” Think of it, then, like intelligent design—that follows the principles of natural selection.\nEvolution can still be rather explosive, though. 550 million years ago the Cambrian Explosion kicked off, giving birth to an incredible array of complex organisms. Before that, life was relatively squishier, relatively calmer. But then boom, predators a plenty, scrapping like hell to gain an edge. One theory for why is the development of vision, which allowed new species to better find mates and hunt food, setting off an evolutionary arms race.\nThe same may be happening in robotics, because robots are finally developing the senses that will let them understand the world and act on their own. Robots have for a while now navigated by building a map of their surroundings with lasers—the robocars of the 2004 Darpa Grand Challenge, which built the foundation for consumer self-driving cars, did this. But advances in computer vision are helping robots see better and better. For instance, a companion robot called Kuri navigates with lasers, but now also recognizes faces with machine vision. Getting robots to see well means training algorithms with lots of good data, and those algorithms will only get more powerful and efficient from here. It's this literal and metaphorical vision that could set off a Cambrian Explosion of robotics.\nThe interesting bit about Cassie is that while it looks vaguely bird-like, Hurst and his team didn’t explicitly mimic anything in nature. What they were after was the most stable and efficient way to walk, and their math led them to a form factor that just so happens to look like a bird.\nNow, think of what niches robots can adapt to beyond the confines of Earth. “Animals are all in outdoor environments,” says Hurst. “They're diversified for different sizes and different speeds and different niches in the environment. But animals have never explored another planet.” Imagine robots designed to play with gravity is clever ways, like NASA’s Super Ball Bot, which is essentially a sphere of cables and joints.\nAs robots push into our oceans and into space and everywhere in between, their design will unfold in fascinating ways. You may want a humanoid robot to explore decidedly human environments like buildings, where it can climb stairs and turn knobs (and hell, do backflips). But where humanity is headed, we’ll need unique robots for unique niches.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

We host multiple game servers as well. I've got a team of moderators that help keep the forum and game servers clean. I've run this site for 5 years, after taking it over from the original creator of the community who wanted to move on. In my time as admin, we've seen the number of participants on the forum increase. We've seen our game server population increase as well. I attribute this to getting the community involved in change discussions. \nOne of our biggest changes occurred several years ago. Community members complained that our game servers would be over run with trolls at hours when moderators weren't available and spewing filth. The community wanted a cleaner game server experience. Users wanted these players gone immediately. Previous community leaders felt that trolling of this kind was part of the game and did nothing. After some discussions regarding what was and wasn't appropriate, we decided to be (for lack of a better term) \"family friendlier\". Certain 'extreme' phrases were no longer tolerated at all. A technical solution was built to automatically remove players that violated these rules. This solution allowed users to swear, but once it became excessive (again, defined by the community) they, too, were removed.\nThe tool we have (PHPBB3) may not have the reputation, badges, or increasing privileges used here on Stack Exchange but for my community that has not been a negative. Engaging with the community in discussions and letting the members provide input that me and my team utilize has been extremely beneficial. \nI have no experience moderating a Stack Exchange site. I don't feel that's a down side though. I can provide the \"outside\" perspective in a Stack Exchange heavy group. That does mean, though, that I'd depend on and expect the community to provide feedback on how moderation in being handled. Much like my existing gaming community, input from the community to the moderation team is important and the moderation team should be listening to that input. \n\nA:\n\nI guess I'll throw my hat in the ring as well.  As someone who has been a moderator on IRC, forums, games, wikipedia and currently on multiple SE sites, as well as having led in person debates, I'm familiar with a broad range of moderation environments and topics.  This set of experience ideally prepares me for being able to understand the relationships between different types of moderation.  \nThat said, I do also think we should make sure at least one pro temp moderator is someone without previous SE moderator experience that is primarily currently active in moderating another community if such a user steps forward.", "output": "I would like to nominate Monica Cellio.\n\nprofile for Monica Cellio on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&A sites http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/505925.png\n\nIn particular, I've been impressed by the way Monica's contributions on the main site explicitly acknowledge the diversity of perspectives that exist within every community. \nMonica's answers demonstrate an ability to communicate clearly and effectively and an appreciation for how nuanced a job moderation and community building can be.

{"input": "How to win in dodgeball?", "output": "Dodgeball is a rather simple game; hit your opponents with the ball to eliminate them and avoid balls thrown at you. These are the basic rules of the game, but there are a number of tricks and strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning. They can roughly be grouped into three categories: tricks for throwing the ball, tips for catching the ball, and working as a team.\n1. You’ll have much more power throwing the ball with one arm than trying to toss it with two. Spread out your fingers to grip the ball tightly. Hold the dodgeball much like you’d hold a tennis ball.\nIf your hands are too small to grip the dodgeball this way, you can curl your hand and wrist around the ball, cradling it. You’ll still be able to throw the ball effectively.\n2. It’s much more difficult for your opponents to catch the ball if you throw it at their shins. Even if they dodge your throw, at least you won’t be out. Be careful not to let the ball bounce before it reaches your target.\n3. Even if your throws are powerful, limit the distance between yourself and your target. That way, all the power you put into your throw is translated to speed, making dodging more difficult for your opponents.\n4. Whether you have a ball in your hands or not, keep your hands hidden. This gives less information to the opposing team and prevents them from making educated decisions. This is a simple way to get an edge over the other team.\n5. Dealing with the opposing team’s best throwers will keep your team alive longer. Limiting your adversary’s ability to eliminate your side gives you the edge as the game stretches on.\n6. Put as much distance between yourself and your opponents as possible when you’re on the defensive. This gives you more time to see the balls coming and more time to react. This makes it easier to catch or dodge incoming throws.\n7. When you’re making a catch, use as much of your body as possible. Use your hands to make first contact with the ball, then scoop it towards you until it hits your chest. This makes you less likely to drop the ball and be eliminated.\n8. If you’ve already got a ball, you can hit incoming balls rather than dodging them. This is especially useful for balls that are thrown low. Hold the ball firmly in your hands and push out quickly towards the incoming ball to bounce it away.\nBe careful not to drop your ball when blocking incoming shots, or you’ll be eliminated.\n9. Since it’s good strategy to throw balls low, you might not be able to catch or deflect everything that’s thrown at you. If a ball’s coming right down the middle, split your legs as you jump, and aim to get just enough height to narrowly miss the ball. If you put too much spring in your jump, it’ll take you longer to readjust to face the next throw. When the ball comes at just one of your legs, just lift that leg as you jump.\n10. Before play starts, have everyone on the team agree on a number given to each member of the other team. This will help you coordinate both attack and defense, since you’ll all be on the same page when referring to other players.\n11. Dodging or catching a single ball is simple. When two or more are coming at your opponents, you’re making things more complicated for them. Use the numbers you’ve already assigned to coordinate attacks against specific targets. Call that number out just before your throw.\n12. If your team stays close together, you’ll essentially present one large target to your adversaries. Instead, spread out along the back wall for defense. Move forward when you need to throw, but try not to get in the way of your teammate’s line of sight. This will make their throws more difficult.\n13. Hitting enemy players with a ball isn’t the only way to eliminate them. It takes some coordination between team members, but it’s possible to force an opponent to step out of bounds by making them dodge in that direction.\nSay you want to make an opponent dodge left until they’re out of bounds, keep throwing at their right side. After a few throws, they’ll start moving left and eliminate themselves.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the possible impact of Trump’s appointment choices on the federal workforce.", "output": "Research shows many professional staffers leave when a new president takes power—especially one with whom they don’t agree.\nNow that Draining The Swamp is back on the agenda—and it definitely is, Donald Trump says—folks who labor in the myriad federal buildings dotting Washington are probably thinking about their options. How will Trump approach the federal government’s 2.5 million federal employees, or the 7,000-odd senior managers who assist political appointees? Will they even want to stay?\nSigns point to an exodus. A study published earlier this month suggests that senior civil servants leave in droves during the first year of a new administration. They’re especially likely to quit when the incoming president’s politics are counter to the agency’s own ideological leanings.\nAnd when these leaders leave, they take their experience and connections with them, leaving federal departments worse off.\nThe idea that agencies even have ideological leanings might raise a few eyebrows. They’re supposed to be apolitical, after all. And the paper’s logic presumes that most employees would fall in line with their agencies’ reputations. But data collected through years of surveys indicate government departments do have political preferences, and the study’s authors say there’s strong evidence linking those preferences to the departure of senior managers under unfriendly administrations.\nTo prove their point, researchers cracked open a massive employee database from the Office of Personnel Management, spanning 23 years and millions of workers. Electing a new president had almost no effect on the rank-and-file members of government, they found. Instead, most of the departures came from the Senior Executive Service, the elite cadre of managers who are often the primary layer between the appointees the president picks and the rest of the federal workforce.\nHow could this play out under a Trump administration? Well, the president-elect has already nominated a climate-change denier to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and he wants to hand control of the Department of Energy to a man who’d prefer to abolish it. Plus, he’s a Republican. The study’s model would suggest a spike in departures from liberal-leaning agencies, including the EPA, the Department of Education, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nOn the other end, the model expects to see more stable employment at more conservative branches, including the military. Indeed, Trump was endorsed by unions representing both agents in both the Border Patrol and Immigration, Customs and Enforcement, whose ranks will almost certainly swell if the president-elect gets his way.\nCan the loss of experienced managers be prevented? “Some presidents who enter office have tended to be skeptical and suspicious of career employees,” said the study’s co-author, Alexander Bolton, a political science professor at Emory University. “But management strategies and the inclusion of career employees might help mitigate this mistrust.” Civil-service employees fear being ignored, just as much as presidents fear being undermined.\nGiven Trump’s adversarial stance toward government, Washington will likely see turnover. What this means for the long term isn’t clear. The machinery of government has always chugged along, even amid the most dramatic transfers of power. But as the president installs his own people at the top, and skeptical bureaucrats who report to them depart, the agencies begin to look more like him.\nFor conservatives, that might be a boon—a way to remake government along more congenial lines. But it could also be an impediment to a president with an ambitious agenda, thinning out the ranks of professionals who possess the knowledge necessary to navigate a complicated bureaucracy and implement policies swiftly and effectively. It’s hard to push through policies over the active resistance of the people charged with implementing them, but it can be just as hard to implement them without experienced managers capable of putting plans into action.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

That's something we got to go back and watch our tendencies and figure out where we line up or how we line up or what formation or whatever it may be.\"\nIf this is true -- Eagles wideout Josh Huff walked back on his claim when confronted by Eagles head coach Chip Kelly -- this is not a claim to be taken lightly.\nPlayers are not only at an extreme disadvantage schematically, but their safety is also at risk.

{"input": "Story: The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!” Who has the traitor's map?", "output": "“It must be Lucius,” said one soldier, “since he hates the American rebels.”\n\n“But if I were trying to escape, I wouldn't reveal that I supported the British,” Nate said. “Besides, he was clearly just 17 years old. He's too young to be a major in the British army!”\n\n“I thought Edward looked suspicious,” another soldier suggested, “since he kept trying to remind us how long he'd been farming.”\n\n“He's a hard-working farmer,” Nate replied, “and besides, he's traveling in his bare feet. The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\n\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold. Arnold bragged that he's had himself placed in command of the fort — but only so he could surrender it to the British!\n\nIt would've been a horrible setback for the American cause. But now that they'd recovered the map and discovered Arnold's secret plan, the fort at West Point would remain safe from attack; and so would the American army.\n\nBut as the sun crept higher into the Virginia sky, Nate was happy for another reason: He finally had some good news to bring to General Washington.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "For someone who is new to treat lameness in horses, what would be 10 key steps to get started?", "output": "When a horse goes lame it is a major concern for the owner, and knowing how to treat lameness can have a positive impact on both the speed and success of recovery. From physiotherapy to medical treatments, this article considers different aspects of treating lameness in horses.\n1. Allow the horse to take plenty of rest.: Box rest is the mainstay of lameness treatment for many horses. Depending on the nature of the lameness, horses may need rest for anywhere from a few days for a simple sprain, to weeks or even months for a more serious injury.\n\nRest places less demands on an injured joint surface, where continued use would provoke further inflammation. Continuing to work a lame horse can potentially cause further physical damage, such as chip the inflamed cartilage lining to a join, and cause permanent harm.\nAlso, working a lame horse provokes the release of further prostaglandins and hence worsens inflammation. By resting the horse you attempt to break this vicious circle.\n2. Cold hose the horse's leg for 20 minutes a day.: Cold hosing is a simple form of hydrotherapy employed to reduce swelling in a limb  It involves running cool water from a garden hose over the lame leg. This is usually done for 20 minutes once or twice a day. The principle is that the cold water removes the heat associated with swelling, while the water flow massages the tissue and helps disperse fluid build-up.\n\nIdeally, the water temperature should be very cold. The advantage of hosing is that the  temperature remains constant and does not warm up (as with an ice pack). 20 minutes sessions are ideal because this is enough time to disperse heat, but is not enough time for the cold to compromise  blood circulation to the limb.\nIt is a good idea to smear Vaseline or grease over the horse's heel prior to hosing. This prevents the tissue of the heel becoming softened by the constant stream of water which could predispose it to cracking and infection.\nUnless your horse is very well-mannered, hosing is a two person job – one to hose and one to steady the horse. Depending on the nature of the injury your veterinarian will advise on how many days to continue hosing after the swelling has resolved.\n3. Try hot tubbing to treat lower limb lameness.: Hot tubbing is used to treat lower limb lameness where the cause is a suspected abscess or a foreign body in the hoof, because hot tubbing softens tissues and helps to draw infection out. It involves immersing the foot in a bucket of hot 100°F (38°C) water containing Epsom salts to soften the sole of the foot and allow infection to drain.\n\nAlways clean the hoof thoroughly before immersing in the clean water. If necessary use a hoof pick to clean the sole and frog, and wash the hoof in water ahead of tubbing. It is a good idea to remove the bucket handle to prevent the leg from accidentally getting trapped between the handle and bucket.\nFill the bucket with hot water and add a cupful of Epsom salts. Stand the horse's leg into the bucket and keep it there for 15 to 20 minutes. As the water cools over time, remove the foot while you top the bucket up with hot water. After soaking for 20 minutes, place the hoof on a clean towel and dry it well. This procedure can be repeated 3 to 4 times daily.\n4. Use hot fomentation to treat abscesses and infection higher up on the leg.: Fomentation has a similar indication as for tubbing (suspected infections, or abscesses), but is used on higher areas of the leg which are not practical to immerse in a bucket.\n\nTo apply a hot fomentation, soak a clean towel in hot water and Epsom salts and wrap it around the swollen or inflamed part of the leg. Place a second towel in the bucket of water and Epsom salts.\nWhen the towel that is wrapped around the leg cools, replace it with the waiting hot one from the bucket. Use hot fomentation in 15 to 20 minute sessions, 3 to 4 times daily.\n5. Apply a poultice to reduce swelling after exercise.: Poultices have a number of applications in that they can reduce swelling after hard exercise and draw out infection from an abscess. Traditionally bran poultices were popular, but with the advent of many excellent commercial poultices, (such as Animalintex) the need for messy home-prepared poultices has dropped off.\n\nCommercial poultices come as an impregnated sheet with a shiny side (face this away from the animal) and an absorbent side (applied to the injury). First cut your poultice to the desired size so that the injured area is completely covered. It can be used dry (great for reducing swelling) or wet (to draw out infection). Both methods are applied in the same way, but when using a wet poultice the precut material is soaked in hot water first, and allowed to cool to 100°F.\nThe poultice is placed against the injury or swelling and held in place with a dressing such as Vetwrap self-adhesive bandage. Enough tension is applied to the bandage to stop it from slipping down, but not so much as to cut off the circulation to the limb.\nA poultice should never be left on for more than 12 hours, and it is preferable to change them 2 or 3 times daily.\n6. Use pain relieving medications to help with lameness.: Pain relief has an important role to play in the treatment of lameness. Modern painkillers (analgesics) have a dual action of reducing pain and inflammation, and belong to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group of drugs (NSAIDS).\n\nNSAIDs work by inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX1 and COX2). It is the COX enzymes that release prostaglandins that cause inflammation and pain. By blocking COX enzymes the mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins) are reduced and so pain is reduced.\nThe most commonly used NSAID pharmaceuticals for the relief of bone and joint problems in the horse are aspirin, flunixin, and phenylbutazone.\n7. Give your horse aspirin for mild pain.: Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is effective against mild pain, swelling, and discomfort. Some aspirin products are available over the counter from pharmacies which makes them a useful first option treatment for mild lameness.\n\nAniPrin contains powdered acetylsalicylic acid mixed with a palatable molasses flavor base, designed to be mixed into the horse's feed. The dose is 10mg/kg once daily.\nFor a 500kg horse this equates to 5,000mg (or 5 grams) of AniPrin.  Two scoops are supplied with the product: the larger measures out 28.35grams, and the smaller 3.75grams. Thus, a typical 500kg horse requires 1.5 small scoops of AniPrin once daily on food.\nNever give aspirin to a horse that is taking other medications without first consulting your vet, and always provide a plentiful supply of fresh water.\n8. Use phenylbutazone to reduce pain and fever.: Commonly known as \"bute\" amongst horse owners, phenylbutazone reduces pain and fever. Phenylbutazone is a prescription NSAID and needs to be prescribed by your vet. It should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs, steroids, or given on an empty stomach.\n\nPhenylbutazone interacts with some medications (such as phenytoin, sulfonamides, warfarin, barbiturates, and digoxin) so always speak to your vet before starting treatment.\n\nA typical equine preparation is of phenylbutazone is Butazolidin. The dose for a 454kg horse is 2 to 4grams once a day with or after food. It is available as 1gram tablets, an oral paste, or an oral powder containing 1g of phenylbutazone in a 10gram sachet. The manufacturer advises not to exceed 4g rams a day, and to administer the lowest effective dose where possible.\n9. Get a prescription for flunixin to reduce pain and inflammation.: Flunixin is another prescription NSAID, sold commercially as Banamine.\n\nBanamine is a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor which inhibits prostaglandin and therefore brings down inflammation. It is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine, and each dose works for 24 to 30 hours.\nThe dose of Banamine is 1.1mg/kg once daily by mouth. Therefore, a 500kg horse requires 550 mg (0.5g), which is equivalent to one 20g sachet which contains 500mg of flunixin.\n10. Be aware of the possible side effects of NSAIDs.: NSAIDS can reduce the blood supply to the stomach and kidneys. While this should not be significant in healthy, well-hydrated horses (especially when the medication is given with food), NSAIDs should never be given to dehydrated animals because this could concentrate the drug and amplify its damaging effects on the kidney.\n\nOther side effects of NSAIDs include gastric ulceration and possible worsening of pre-existing kidney disease. This can manifest itself as a loss of appetite, and increased thirst. The treatment involves stopping NSAID medications and giving drugs such as activated charcoal in order to protect the stomach lining.\nA horse diagnosed with renal disease may need intravenous fluid therapy to flush the accumulation of naturally occurring toxins that the kidney has not got rid of out of the system.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Since last season, however, the number has trended in the wrong direction.\nDon’t be surprised if it drops again soon.\nBy any metric, Jackson, who was in his third season and is the first head coach to be fired in 2018, failed in Cleveland. His first two seasons were almost as bad as it gets: 1-15 and 0-16. That’s a 1-31 stretch. The 2017 Browns joined the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only NFL teams to go winless during a 16-game regular season.\nDespite the excitement in northern Ohio about the impressive start of rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft, and the Browns’ clear improvement this season at 2-5-1 (as low as they were, even incremental progress is worth trumpeting), team ownership still cut ties with Jackson. Cleveland’s current three-game losing streak and growing tension within the team’s facility because of the toxic relationship between Jackson and first-year Browns offensive coordinator Todd Haley, who was also ousted Monday, was too much for Jackson to overcome.\nIn an overwhelmingly African-American league in which almost 70 percent of the players are black, it’s simply unacceptable that so few black people are head coaches.\nHere’s the thing: No credible argument can be made against the firing of Jackson, especially with Mayfield’s development being priority No. 1 for the franchise. The Browns couldn’t have their head coach and offensive coordinator essentially being at war and be truly committed to putting Mayfield in a supportive environment to grow.\nBut here’s the problem: In an overwhelmingly African-American league in which almost 70 percent of the players are black, it’s simply unacceptable that so few black people are head coaches. Many African-American assistant coaches and former assistants were upset that Jackson didn’t get more time because of what the move meant for both Jackson individually and black coaches as a whole.\nRock Cartwright is among those who hoped Jackson would stick for a long stretch in the Buckeye State.\nA former NFL running back and special-teams standout, Cartwright was part of Jackson’s Browns staff for two seasons, serving as an offensive quality control coach and assistant running backs coach. The firing of Jackson was a blow to all black coaches, Cartwright said.\n“As far as black coaches, I feel the leash is always shorter,” he said on the phone. “I was with Hue the first two years [in Cleveland] and we didn’t have the players we needed to win football games, so I would not judge him on those two years.\nThroughout his career, Jackson has served as a mentor to younger black coaches. He has been committed to helping more African-Americans gain a foothold in the NFL.\nAmong head coaches of color, Jackson, who previously coached the Oakland Raiders in 2011, was also something of a rarity because he ascended through the NFL ranks on offense.\nDuring an era in which owners prefer to pick from that side of the ball to fill top openings, there aren’t enough candidates of color on offense. Commissioner Roger Goodell has acknowledged the league needs to redouble its efforts to improve that pipeline.\nAt the midway point of the regular season, it appears several of the other African-American head coaches are on shaky footing.\nTodd Bowles of the New York Jets and Vance Joseph of the Denver Broncos lead struggling teams. By the end of the season, they may also be boxing up their offices. Although Steve Wilks of the Arizona Cardinals is in his first season, the team has often performed so abysmally that his long-term standing with the franchise seems at least open to debate.\nAnthony Lynn of the Los Angeles Chargers, Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Marvin Lewis of the Cincinnati Bengals all lead teams in playoff contention. Ron Rivera of the Carolina Panthers, the league’s other head coach of color, seemingly continues to be in a strong position with his team in the playoff hunt again.\nJackson has had two chances. It’s highly doubtful he’ll ever get another.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is the role of teachers and teacher educators in Australia's education system?", "output": "Great article from great colleagues who have a deep and respectful understanding of the complex work and contexts of teachers and teacher educators. To support their advocacy to trust teachers and teacher educators, it’s worthwhile understanding the wider strategic importance of initial teacher education in Australia. To illustrate, approximately 8-10% of students in higher education in Australia are studying Education, while the remaining 90% or so students who are studying other important fields of human endeavour (e.g. Medicine, Law, Engineering, Arts, Science, Dentistry, Nursing, Business, etc) were taught by teachers. And, importantly, those teachers, in turn, were taught by teacher educators.\n“So next time a public speaker takes a cheap shot at school teachers, reflect for a moment on just how much our political system, our way of associating, our peaceful streets and national consensus about the norms of public life, are learned from teachers.\n… Teachers are, for me, the heroes of this and every Australia Day”.\nRather than just noting teacher’s high workload, I suggest doing something about it. I suggest training teachers to work together, including using technology, so they are not working alone. Also teachers could be trained to use technology for teaching and administrative tasks. Where schools don’t provide the systems needed, educational academics can step in and commission it. The software engineering students in Australian universities can then build the software. As an example, I have an ANU student building an addition module for Moodle for me to add quizzes to videos.\nThat’d be great if we were allowed to use third-party administration software, but we have to use the clunky, government developed systems.\nSarah, you can change clunky government systems. Martin Dougiamas did not like available teaching software, so he wrote Moodle. I didn’t like the networking systems used by the Australian Government, so I joined the cabal which had the Internet and the World Wide Web adopted. The way to do this is to think like a professional: get together with your colleagues, professional bodies and academics, work out what to do and then do it. You will find plenty of people willing to help. Work out what you want, have the open source community develop it, have academics teach how to use it for training purposes, and have innovation students work on marketing it to schools.\nIt is to be considered that those who criticise the work of schools and our teachers have little background in education except that they attended a school themselves. In their criticisms, they rely on this background of a different time. Moreover, their knowledge of the complexities of schools and teaching, the chaos of working in an environment of children living life as children and working in an environment where politicians recognise themselves as the clients of the system and not those children and their parents has changed the nature of schooling in the last 30 years.\nIn my early years as a teacher, I was made to feel that I was the person who had the knowledge and disposition about teaching. I pursued study at night for years to extend my knowledge and build the extensive understanding required to work with children in a school setting. This was respected by parents and colleagues. Now, however, many who have never stepped inside a classroom since leaving one themselves feel they know and can dictate.\nThis is making staffing our schools a difficult task. Teachers burnout quickly when under rapid fire criticism.\nThanks Glenn. We are desperately hoping that those that seek to find fault with teachers, and who agitate through the media to denigrate the quality of our profession, will start to see some sense in celebrating the achievements of our teachers instead.\nOur teachers ARE experts in teaching and learning, and our teacher educators ARE experts in teacher education and educational research. It is about time that we moved forward in education in Australia. The only way we will do this is by listening to them!\nSorry – 3 highly accomplished and well-respected teacher educators and researchers.\nThank you Nan, Donna and Jo-Anne for an important statement about teachers and teaching. Great leaders lead from the front and your contribution is a valuable statement at a time of significant complexity in our world and in our local communities. If we are to continue to attract great people into our initial teacher education programs and hold onto them beyond their early career teaching phase we need to disrupt this sustained and unjustified critique of our teaching profession. In addition, we need to critique the sustained emphasis on graduate teachers who often commence teaching in some of the most challenging teaching contexts with limited resources and limited supports. Our early career workforce is working hard every day to meet the needs of their communities in the most remarkable ways and they do a great job of it! I hope that your message reaches our early career colleagues, pre-service teachers and those thinking about teaching, to inspire them to critique the critique and continue to work towards creating great futures for others. Well done!\nBrilliant article, backed up by intuitive comment by peers and others.\nWhen faced with the criticism that students are entering teaching degrees with low tertiary entrance scores, I would argue that some of the best teachers are those who have struggled to learn and therefore will often have a greater understanding of their students’ learning impediments.\nThanks for the support! It is such a shame the media does not elect to publicize this perspective. It is difficult enough to be a good teacher, without demoralizing media coverage. It will become increasingly difficult to recruit bright innovative thinkers to the profession if we don’t enhance the respect in which it is held. Comments such as these certainly help, in that regard.\nVery well said, Sue…please know that there are many who value your important work and efforts, and this needs to be elevated and find expression through the media for the profession.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is your opinion about engaging with Betsy DeVos, President Trump's controversial pick for Education Secretary?", "output": "President Donald Trump and his advisers probably didn’t expect his choice for education secretary to cause much of a fuss. After all, Rick Perry was tapped to run the Department of Energy, which he once said he wanted to eliminate. Senator Jeff Sessions, who has spent his career attacking voting rights, was up for attorney general. Scott Pruitt, nominated to run the EPA, has sued the agency at least 14 times. Even Ben Carson was offered a job.\nAnd yet, Betsy DeVos turned out to be Trump’s most controversial cabinet pick. It came as a surprise to many in Washington, but it didn’t come out of the blue.\nAhead of DeVos’s confirmation vote, union leaders hammered her on cable news, and the NEA organized a million people to email senators in opposition to her nomination. At least 40,000 called the Capitol through a special switchboard the union set up.\nJefferson Academy promptly took her to school on Twitter.\nKaya Henderson, the former chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, also jumped to the school’s defense.\nFew public school teachers, it seems, are willing to give DeVos the benefit of the doubt. That’s certainly true of Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association, the largest union of any kind in America (3.2 million members). “She will get no grace, and she deserves no grace,” Eskelsen García told me on the eve of DeVos’s confirmation vote.\nBut Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers (1.6 million members), feels slightly differently. Whereas the NEA is declaring outright opposition, the AFT is cautiously engaging with DeVos, holding out hope for common ground. Weingarten, who has spoken with DeVos over the phone, has agreed to visit a non-traditional “choice school” with her. “You have to talk, and you have to engage,” Weingarten told me.\nThese divergent approaches to DeVos at the beginning of her tenure mirror a broader divergence on the left—from Democrats on Capitol Hill to progressive activists across America—about how to approach the Trump administration: with unequivocal resistance, or a willingness to compromise?\nUltimately, they struck a deal: DeVos would visit a public school with Weingarten, and Weingarten would go to a non-traditional “choice school” with DeVos. The details of these visits are now being worked out.\nI asked Weingarten whether she could really find common ground with DeVos, who has long bankrolled failed free-market school reforms. “I have no idea,” Weingarten said. But she’s committed to engaging with DeVos, so the education secretary has no excuse to ignore her or the causes she cares about. “Forcing her to actually see what goes on, walking the walk of teachers and parents and students—I see that as an act of resistance,” Weingarten said.\n2. Will you agree not to privatize funding for Special Education or Title I?\nWeingarten says she applauds Eskelsen García for demanding answers. She sent her own letter to DeVos last week, but it was as welcoming as it was admonishing—inviting DeVos to learn more about the successes and challenges of public education in America, and expressing hope for the secretary to have a change of heart.\nCan I see myself having a working relationship with someone who does not share our intrinsic value that all students deserve the opportunity to succeed? That answer is no, nor will we stop advocating on behalf of our members and their students to ensure that all children, regardless of ZIP code, have the opportunity for a public-school education that inspires them and nurtures their talents and abilities.\nAmerican Enterprise Institute scholar Rick Hess, a leading conservative voice in education policy, thinks this is admirable. He praised Weingarten for agreeing to tour schools with DeVos.\nNot everyone in the AFT is in agreement. Arthur Goldstein, a Weingarten critic on the executive board of the union’s New York City affiliate, United Federation of Teachers, told me that working with DeVos is probably futile.\nBut DeVos will be able to steer education policy in more subtle ways, Nelson noted. She can go easy on for-profit colleges, choose not to aggressively enforce the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, amend sexual assault policy to empower accused students, deemphasize the Obama administration’s focus on racial disparities in discipline, and undo protections for transgender students. (on Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the latter is in the works, albeit over DeVos’s objections).\nPerhaps, in meeting with DeVos, Weingarten is hoping to wield influence over these potential moves. Touring a couple of schools together hardly suggests policy agreement. If nothing comes of it, Weingarten’s early willingness to engage could make her a more authoritative critic of DeVos down the line.\nThe risk, however, is that these overtures to DeVos will alienate the segment of her union membership that prefers all-out opposition. Perhaps that’s why Weingarten stressed that her engagement with the education secretary has been very limited.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What is Duverger's law and its implications for party systems?", "output": "The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a “law” or principle. Duverger's law suggests a nexus or synthesis between a party system and an electoral system: a proportional representation (PR) system creates the electoral conditions necessary to foster party development while a plurality system marginalizes many smaller political parties, resulting in what is known as a two-party system.\nA two-party system often develops from the single-member district plurality voting system (SMDP). In an SMDP system, voters have a single vote which they can cast for a single candidate in their district, in which only one legislative seat is available. The winner of the seat is determined by the candidate with the most votes. This means that the SMDP system has several qualities that can serve to discourage the development of third parties and reward the two major parties.\nDuverger suggests two reasons why single-member district plurality voting systems favor a two party system. One is the result of the \"fusion\" (or an alliance very like fusion) of the weak parties, and the other is the \"elimination\" of weak parties by the voters, by which he means that the voters gradually desert the weak parties on the grounds that they have no chance of winning.\nA prominent restrictive feature unique to the SMDP voting system is purely statistical. Because the SMDP system only gives the winner in each district a seat, a party which consistently comes third in every district will not gain any seats in the legislature, even if it receives a significant proportion of the vote. This puts geographically thinly spread parties at a significant disadvantage. An example of this is the Liberal Democrats in the UK, whose proportion of seats in the legislative is significantly less than their proportion of the national vote. The Green Party of Canada is also a good example. The party receives approximately 5% of the popular vote, but has not yet won a seat in the House of Commons. Gerrymandering is sometimes used to counteract such geographic difficulties in local politics, but controversial on a large scale. These numerical disadvantages can create an artificial limit on the level at which a third party can engage in the political process.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

However, throughout the story Hakuro blames himself when he is able to help people close to him. And before Kuuya regressed, not only was Genjimaru killed, but Dii also attacked her, leaving her Mecha badly damaged.\nI am wondering if it was really Hakuro being transformed that caused Kuuya to regress (out of fear) or if it were other factors that had occurred at that time.", "output": "My best guess would be the preceding events before Hakuoro's transformation. I'm going to go with the game's depiction of the scene for the most part.\nThe game shows more happening to Kuuya mostly due to the fact that she's awake through the whole event, rather than lying there unconscious which the anime shows. She learns of Hien and Hauenkua's betrayal and their allegiance with Dii, causing her to attack them after Dii kills Genjimaru. What the anime doesn't show is that she's still in her Avu Kamuu during the time of the attack, rather than having it damaged beyond repair during her fight with Hakuoro. Also, she is attacked directly by Hauenkua and Dii (in his transformed state)\nBefore she sees what's left of Genji, Hakuoro, in his transformed state, tries to console her and make her calm down. However, seeing what Dii was at the time and Hakuoro directly mimicking his appearance, Kuuya screams at him to get away, thinking that he's the same one who attacked her. She tries to escape by falling out of the Avu Kamuu, but unfortunately ends up landing right next to the remains of Genji, finally realizing what happened. \nTo bring up the anime, Kuuya sees what happens to Genji, causing her to react the same way. While she does see Hakuoro fighting in his transformed state it isn't as overt as the game's depiction of the same scene and that she doesn't see most of it. I think the biggest impact on her was Genji being murdered right in front of her. \nSo, I think while Hakuoro may have had some hand at it, it was more of a combination of events.

{"input": "Write a description of the Batwoman series in development for the CW.", "output": "Batwoman is already scheduled to visit the Arrowverse for the annual crossover event in December; she may now become a permanent member of it, expanding the universe and breaking some TV ground in the process.\nThe CW has put in development a Batwoman series for 2019 consideration. It hails from former The Vampire Diaries executive producer Caroline Dries and the architect of the CW Arrowverse, Greg Berlanti.\nIn Batwoman, written by Dries based on the DC characters, armed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, Kate Kane soars onto the streets of Gotham as Batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city’s criminal resurgence. But don’t call her a hero yet. In a city desperate for a savior, Kate must overcome her own demons before embracing the call to be Gotham’s symbol of hope.\nBatwoman already has been a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ representation in comics. After a long hiatus, she was reintroduced to the DC comic universe in 2006 when she was established as a Jewish lesbian, becoming the first-ever lesbian superhero title DC character. Now Batwoman would become the first gay lead character — male or female — of a live-action superhero series. (DC, Berlanti and Warner Bros. Animation previously collaborated on the first animated show with a gay lead, Freedom Fighters: The Ray on CW Seed).\nBatwoman would join Arrowverse, which features a number of LGBT characters, including Arrow‘s Curtis Holt, The Flash‘s Captain Singh, Legends‘ Sara Lance and Supergirl‘s Alex Danvers.\nBatwoman comes from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television where the company recently extended its overall deal. Dries, who is lesbian, executive produces alongside Berlanti Prods.’ Berlanti and Sarah Schechter as well as former DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns (The Flash) via his new Mad Ghost Productions banner. Johns also has been producing the long-gestating Batgirl DC feature at Warner Bros., which switched writers this past spring.\nIt was Arrow star Stephen Amell, along with the CW president Mark Pedowitz, who announced at the CW presentation in May that this year’s crossover event will feature Batwoman. “This is the first time ever that Batwoman will make a live-action appearance on any screen,” Pedowitz said, adding that, along with Batwoman, the City of Gotham also will be added to the ever-expanding Arrowverse.\nWith Batwoman, the CW is following the strategy it used for The Flash, whose central character was introduced in a two-episode arc on Arrow in December 2013. While originally the network had planned a third Arrow episode later that season to serve as The Flash backdoor pilot, it ultimately opted for a standalone Flash pilot, which launched the series the following fall.\nDries has superhero credentials — she started her writing career on the CW/WBTV Smallville before a seven-season run on The Vampire Diaries, on which she rose to executive producer and showrunner.\nThe character Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics #233 in 1956, in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman. On TV, Batwoman first appeared in animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold, which premiered on Cartoon Network in 2008. On film, Batwoman appeared in Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, voiced by Kyra Sedgwick, a 2002 direct-to-video animated film based on animated series The New Batman Adventures. Batwoman also made a cameo in direct-to-video superhero film Batman vs. Robin and appeared in 2016’s Batman: Bad Blood, voiced by Yvonne Strahovski.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

But for now, it’s one of the most revisited worlds to derive inspiration when inventors and scientists are thinking up new and exciting technologies. If George Lucas wouldn’t have thought up the idea of a futuristic world from the start, I wonder what would have happened with all the geekyness that resides in its concept.\nThat’s when the thought hit cartoonist Adam Watson.

{"input": "Story: It was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees from Masterson Technologies had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt they’d sprinkled on their feast at the luau the night before. Craig Willis’ face, however, turned an ashen grey when he saw the dead body in the small pool reserved for Masterson’s top five employees. Well, make that top four. Craig recognized the body as belonging to Trevor Jones, Masterson’s president. A firm believer in remaining physically fit at 50, Trevor’s leadership style reflected his fitness regimen -- no slacking off allowed, period. And since he often extended that to expecting those working under him to work through lunch and not take their rightful breaks, this retreat was the first time he’d ever socialized with his employees. At 32, Craig was a vice president of Masterson Technologies. He didn’t get that high up the corporate ladder that fast by shying away from difficult situations, but his first instinct here was to turn and walk away. A local police officer approached him, pushing all thoughts of running away out of his mind. “I’m Detective Kawika Akana. Are you Craig Willis?” he asked. “Yes.” “Good. That means we have all the suspects in one place. Come join your colleagues.” The detective indicated for Craig to go sit with his co-workers at a poolside table. “Are you just going to leave Trevor floating there?” Craig asked. “I’ve already determined that he was murdered,” the detective said. “The medical examiner will be here soon to confirm that he was forcibly drowned. In the meantime, I’m going to find out which of you killed Mr. Jones …” Craig didn’t know how to reply to that, so he sat down next to Niles Anderson, the company’s 45-year-old accountant. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn’t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. “So this is some sort of corporate retreat?” he asked. “Yes,” Amanda replied. “I suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.” “Hah!” Niles said. “You’re talking like Trevor now.” To Amanda’s questioning look, he explained, “You said ‘trickle down through the ranks’ -- that’s Trevor’s army talk.” “Was Mr. Jones in the military?” Akana asked. “No,” Niles said, “but his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.” “Truth is,” Amanda said, “the retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.” “Yeah,” Stephanie said, “we hoped that outside the office he’d be more open to listening to us.” “But no such luck,” Craig said. “We arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.” “And money,” Niles said. “He counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.” “Meaning you’re the accountant?” Akana asked. “Yes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.” “Hmm,” Akana said. “If the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn’t such a bad leader.” “There’s more to life than money,” Craig said. “Mr. Jones no longer has a life,” Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. “Okay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?” “Well, no,” Niles said, “I met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn’t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.” “I’m not surprised,” Amanda said. “I feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.” “You are so old-fashioned,” Stephanie said to Amanda. “Everyone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you’re afraid of fish!” It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. “Are we talking about why I won’t go swimming again … I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what – I’m terrified of water. But I don’t have a fish phobia. It’s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you’ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.” Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, you win. I don’t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.” Akana smiled. “However you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,” he said. “So go on …” Amanda grinned. “Well, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must’ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.” “Amanda!” Stephanie exclaimed. “But you’re right, I dyed it yesterday and I’m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet …?” “Truce,” Amanda said. “It’s obvious there’s no love lost with Jones, the way you’re acting like everything’s normal,” Akana said. “Give them a break,” Niles said, “everybody mourns in their own way.” “I’m just trying not to think about the body,” Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. “Do we have to sit here much longer?” “No,” Akana said, “I just want to clarify a couple more things. “Why didn’t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?” “He’d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,” Craig said. “In fact, he chastised us for not joining him.” “Who was the last person at the pool with him?” “We all left for lunch together,” Craig said. “But then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi …” “True,” Akana said, “but only one of you is a murderer. And I know who.” Who is the killer?", "output": "“How do you know?” Craig asked. “I didn’t hear anyone say anything incriminating.”\n\n“It’s not always what people say that gives them away,” Akana replied. “For instance, you should’ve seen your face when I first met you. Seeing that body made you turn pale -- you can’t fake that kind of reaction. It’s obvious you’ve never seen a dead body in person before, much less killed someone.\n\n“And the women absolved each other,” Akana said. “Stephanie revealed that Amanda’s afraid of swimming and Amanda revealed that Stephanie didn’t want to get her hair wet. Well, there’s no way either of them could’ve overpowered Mr. Jones long enough to drown him, not with Amanda lacking confidence in the water and Stephanie’s hair remaining dry.”\n\nNiles brayed out a laugh. “So, what? Process of elimination says it’s me? You’ve got the wrong man,” he said.\n\n“Process of elimination usually tells me what I need to know,” the detective said. “But the most common thing is for the guilty party to give themselves away. Like for instance, you lied to me.”\n\nThe others turned and stared at Niles. He scratched at his sunburn nervously. “I did no such thing.”\n\n“You said you didn’t leave your room until you went to lunch …”\n\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n\n“You may not have been at this pool this morning, but you weren’t in your room, either.” Akana pointed at where Niles’ was scratching. “You just arrived yesterday evening, yet you’re sunburned, so you must’ve been in the sun today. So I know you did it, I just don’t know why.”\n\nNiles looked around, as if calculating his chance for escape, but what was he going to do -- swim home from Hawaii? He sighed, defeated. “It’s a big resort,” he said. “I went to the wrong pool this morning and by the time I’d figured it out, I was already settled in on a lounge chair with a good book, so I didn’t feel like moving. I swung by here on my way to lunch and found Trevor swimming alone. He said we were all supposed to stick together on the retreat and accused me of ‘slacking off’ this morning. It was just such a ridiculous a thing for him to get on my case about -- yet so typical of how he treats us -- that I got this uncontrollable urge to make him shut up … for good.”\n\nAkana shook his head in dismay. “And now I have an uncontrollable urge to read you your rights.”", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the Greens' policy on cannabis legalisation.", "output": "The Greens have proposed full legalisation of cannabis – including for recreational use – with a new government agency to act as the single wholesaler of plain-packaged cannabis.\nPeople would also be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants at home for their personal use under the new policy, which was announced by Richard Di Natale on Monday.\nThe policy is the first time a party with significant federal representation has backed full legalisation, providing a point of difference with the Coalition and Labor, which both support a scheme initiated in 2016 to legalise cannabis for medicinal use only.\nUnder the plan cannabis would be taxed and regulated in much the same way as alcohol and tobacco. It would be sold to adults by licensed shops and attract GST as well as federal excise tax.\nIn a statement, Di Natale characterised the policy as a harm minimisation approach that treats “drug use as a health issue, not a criminal issue” and a rational response to the “failed” policy of prohibition.\nThe Greens’ policy notes that 35% of Australians have used cannabis, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare statistics, and there were 79,643 cannabis related arrests in 2015–16, up 6% from 2014-15.\nProlonged use of cannabis can cause dependence, depression and psychological effects, especially if a person has a predisposition to schizophrenia.\nBut according to the AIHW the impact of cannabis on Australians is dwarfed by the effects of alcohol and tobacco.\nA study released in March found that tobacco accounted for 9% of Australia’s combined fatal and non-fatal disease burden and alcohol 4.6%. Illicit drugs were responsible for 2.3% of the disease burden, of which cannabis accounted for only 7%.\nDi Natale, a former doctor, said he had “seen that the ‘tough on drugs’ approach causes enormous harm”.\nThe president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Alex Wodak, welcomed the announcement.\nCannabis is legal in Spain, Uruguay and nine states in the United States, including California. Canada has committed to legalisation this year.\nAn Essential survey conducted in September 2016 found that 47% of respondents were in favour of decriminalising cannabis, compared with 39% who opposed it and 13% who said they did not know. Support runs as high as 55% when people are asked if cannabis should be taxed and regulated like alcohol or tobacco.\nIn January the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced a plan for a home-grown industry of cannabis products for export but at that time only 350 patients in Australia had accessed local products.\nLabor has accused the government of not doing enough to grant access to medicinal cannabis, particularly for blocking imports of cannabis products.\nAfter the health ministers’ meeting on Friday, Hunt announced that all states and territories had now agreed to a NSW and commonwealth joint trial to provide faster access to medicinal cannabis.\n“So there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,” he said.\nHunt said after a medical professional prescribes cannabis, a patient should get access within 48 hours and in many cases 24 hours.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"Paragraph: The story says the federal government is paying about $2,250 per patient for a standard 5-day treatment course. It also notes that the approved alternative treatments are less expensive. The story points out that the benefits of peramivir have yet to be proven and that it is being offered only because some patients are not helped by approved drugs or are they are so sick they need a drug that can be given intravenously. The approved antiviral drugs are currently available only in pill or inhaled form. The story should have mentioned the side effects seen in clinical trials so far, as well as the risk that patients could suffer harms like those sometimes seen in people who have been given similar antiviral drugs. These side effects are clearly spelled out in an FDA fact sheet prepared for patients and caregivers: “The most common side effects of PERAMIVIR are: • diarrhea • nausea • vomiting • white blood cell count decreased These side effects may go away after you stop receiving PERAMIVIR. These are not all the possible side effects of PERAMIVIR. Peramivir is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time. Other medicines that are used to treat people with 2009 H1N1 flu have side effects that may also happen in people who receive PERAMIVIR. These side effects include: • Signs of unusual behavior. People with the flu, especially children and adolescents, may be at a higher risk for seizures, confusion, or abnormal behavior early in their illness. These events may happen after starting PERAMIVIR or may happen if the flu is not treated. These events are not common. Patients should be watched for signs of unusual behavior. • Allergic reaction or severe rash Not a lot of people have taken PERAMIVIR for 5 days or longer. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. The side effects of getting any medicine by vein are brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin where the needle enters, soreness and swelling at that spot, and possible infection at that spot.”  Patient fact sheet available at: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM187799.pdf Provider fact sheet available at: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM187811.pdf The story points out more than once that peramivir is still being tested and that questions remain about its potential effectiveness. The story points out that the experimental drug is being offered only to patients who are already in the hospital and aren’t being helped by approved drugs. The story did not point out that one of the supporters of faster and broader access to peramivir, Dr. Richard Whitley, has long been a booster of the drug, which is being commercially developed by a spin-off of the University of Alabama department he works in. See Whitley comments in a 2005 article promoting the potential of peramivir: http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87834 Here we also point out that the story profiled only one patient and includes a quote from the patient’s father crediting peramivir with saving his daughter’s life. The story does not give any examples of similar patients who either survived after getting approved drugs or who received peramivir and yet did not survive. Despite the clear caveats in the story, the reliance on only a single anecdote may give readers a skewed sense of the benefits of the unapproved drug. The story makes clear that the approved antiviral flu drugs are Tamiflu and Relenza. The story makes very clear that peramivir is experimental and is being offered only because some patients cannot take or aren’t helped by approved antiviral drugs.

{"input": "\"I just tried making this recipe and found that one bunch of dill was not enough for it. What should I do?\"", "output": "This recipe, by Koula Barydakis, has been on Mediterranean Living since 2013. It’s an absolute go-to recipe for us. Five years have gone by and we got our hands on an Instant Pot Cooker. Now this traditional recipe from Crete, that was already super simple to make, is even simpler! There was definitely some trial and error on getting the black-eyed peas to cook all the way through without being undercooked, or overcooked and mushy. We used fresh, dry black eyed peas and didn’t soak them overnight. It was also a challenge to get the right amount of liquid but we’ve got it! If you don’t have an Instant Pot, the original recipe is available here with a video to go along with it! Give this instant pot black eyed peas recipes a try. I think it will be a new favorite!\nDon’t cut back on the olive oil! This dish needs a full cup of extra virgin olive oil or it won’t taste the same!\nUse fresh herbs, not dried.\nFollow the recipe instructions carefully in order to use the Instant Pot correctly.\nBlack eyed peas are actually beans and, like other beans, they are high in protein and fiber. Black eyed peas, along with fresh dill and parsley are all known to help with digestion. If you are having any issues with constipation then this is definitely the recipe for you! If you want to turn this recipe into a 100% anti-inflammatory recipe, I omit the tomato paste and add 2 Tablespoons blackstrap molasses. Finally, if you are on a low sodium diet, this recipe is perfect as you can decide how much salt to add and you don’t need to add a lot because of the high flavor profile that comes from the orange slices, herbs and olive oil. Enjoy!\nCheck out some of our other instant pot recipes below!\nWash the dried black-eyed peas very well and pick out any stones.\nAdd all of the ingredients to the Instant Pot. Stir very well.\nPut the top on the Instant Pot and lock in.\nIMPORTANT! Make sure the vent on top is set to \"sealing\". If it is set to \"venting\", it won't seal in the pressure.\nPress manual on your Instant Pot and set it to 25 minutes. Once you hear a beep and it shows \"On\", you can walk away and the Instant Pot does the rest!\nLooks good. Do you release the pressure when done or let it slow vent?\nAny advice for how to make this if you are starting with pre-soaked Black Eyed Peas?\nI haven’t tried that because the Instant Pot can cook un-soaked beans. I haven’t seen the reason to soak them.\nSo cooked this up tonight in the instant pot. I really enjoyed all the different flavors, this will be a dish that I will make often.\nDid you like the orange flavor? Thanks for commenting!\nI just tried this tonight and I think it’s going to be a go to recipe for me also. Wow!! One cup of olive oil works wonders. I bought two bunches of dill, which after stemming and chopping wasn’t nearly enough. Hopefully next time I make it I’ll do it more justice.\nGlad you loved it Kevin!

{"input": "Do you have any advice on how to run a cross country race successfully? Maybe a step-by-step guide with 16 steps?", "output": "People usually get nervous when running in a road race or a cross country race. If you do, it's OK, because then most people get extra boosts of adrenaline; however, confidence is the ultimate key to success. There are ways to keep yourself thinking positive when running, especially if you're not a good runner. Keep on practicing until you are better than before.\n1. Remember that preparation is crucial.: Hydrate very well and eat healthy the days before the race, and get some good nights' sleep. Prepare yourself psychologically in bed the night before- envision the course in your mind.\n2. Eat a good breakfast (full of fibre, protein ,carbohydrates and sugars) , but make sure you have several hours to digest it or else you'll get a stomach cramp.: Be sure to eat a moderate meal 2-4 hours before the race. If you have a slow digestive system, eat light. The objective is to not get a stomach cramp, but also to not be hungry and devoid of energy. Keep hydrating the day of the race, but again, make sure you have time for it to go through your body or you'll get one of those nasty side-aches. Don't drink Gatorade before a race!\n3. Double tie your running shoes so when you're running your shoes will not come untied.: Wearing Racing Spikes is a good idea in the race since they are lighter and have more tread than normal running shoes. Make sure they feel good and not too tight. Having them too tight is just as bad as not having them tied at all.\n4. At the start of the race, stay with the pack.: Once you lose sight of them, it will be psychologically hard to get back up to them, as you don't know how far ahead they are. But also remember that most Cross Country runners take off too fast, and don't intend to hold their first half mile pace the whole way.\n5. Move through the first 800 meters pretty fast to make sure you get everything out of yourself - then you can tap into your full potential.: Also, you will have the added  benefit of running with the adrenaline still in you, so you might as well use it. It not wise to sprint early in the race, rather start with a brisk 3/4 pace to get a good position in the pack. As the runners thin out you will begin to gain on those ahead of you.\n6. Look for key \"landmarks\" on the race.: (e.g. a mile mark or a downhill), you may want to try the surge. To do this, run about 60 to 90 seconds faster (per mile pace) for about 50 meters. Then, settle back down to \"normal\" pace. This strategy helps break out of the natural \"slow-down-without-even-knowing-it\" obstacle in a race by overriding the chemical in the brain that automatically shuts down your muscles \"without your permission.\"\n7. If your legs start to hurt, don't slow down.: As this will make them hurt more. If you run, you actually can't feel them anymore. But if they don't stop hurting, you might want to stop and ask one of the paramedics there if there are any.\n8. When your legs get tired, pump your arms; remember that your legs cannot outrun your arms.: Obviously, since they're attached to your body. You might notice your arms getting a little sore. If they get very sore (your arms), swing them, but minimally. Pump your arms as hard as you can going up a hill, since your legs will be very, very tired going up and pumping your arms will help them go up faster.\n9. Make competitive goals during the race like \"I'm going to catch the kid in the red\".: After you catch that kid, make a goal about the kid in front of you and so on.\n10. Keep your pace strong.: When there are people cheering you on, use it as an advantage to boost your self-esteem. Don't ever talk negative to yourself, or you race will end up terrible.\n11. On downhills, you should let gravity bring you to a sprint.: You may end up passing a couple people and leaving them behind this way. Uphills and other difficult places in races are also good places to leave people behind in races.\n12. Finish strong.: When you are at the last 100-200 meters, sprint and use the rest of your energy to finish.\n13. Never slow down before you get to the finish line!: Try to do everything you can to get there as fast as you can. Sometimes your legs already know how to do this, especially if you have implanted brains in them that have your legs self-programmed to kick at the end.\n14. Sprint past the finish line so you don't slow down before the line and get a slower time.: Also, If you don't, the kids behind you will probably run into you and begin to scream obscenities.\n15. Congratulate your team even if they had a bad race, team spirit makes all the difference!: Congratulate your team even if they had a bad race, team spirit makes all the difference!\n16. If you do not come first, that's totally fine.: There can only be 1 winner, and your personal goals and times are the things that really matter. Good sportsmanship goes a long way.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Is there a relationship between decimal places and lat and long distances?\n\nA:\n\nI don't understand the last sentence about decimal places, but I can tell you about the relationship between lat, long and distance.\nOver two centuries ago, the meter was defined as one ten-millionth (1/10 000 000) of the length of a quadrant along the Earth's meridian; that is, the distance from the Equator to the North Pole. So, for latitude the number of degrees from the pole to the equator is $90^\\circ\\!$, and the number of meters is 10 million (or 10,000 kilometers). That means $1^\\circ\\!$ of latitude is $10,000/90 = 111$ kilometers, and $0.001^\\circ = 0.111$ kilometers or $111$ meters, essentially an American football field plus both endzones.\nThe total length of the Equator is about equal to four times the distance from a Pole to the Equator. (Slightly more because the Earth's figure is a little oblate, like a slightly flattened ball.) Think of a great circle going from the North pole, to the Equator, to the South pole, to the Equator on the opposite side of the world, then back to North Pole ($360^\\circ\\!\\!$ of a circle). That would be (almost) equivalent to the great circle ($360^\\circ\\!\\!$ of longitude) of the Equator. So, at the Equator, $0.001^\\circ\\!$ of longitude will also be $111$ meters. But...\nThe other circles of latitude are smaller than the great circle of the Equator, yet still have $360^\\circ\\!$, so those degrees cover less than $111$ kilometers.\n\nIn fact, the size of a degree of longitude as a function of latitude scales as the cosine of the latitude. So $0.001^\\circ\\!$ of longitude change at $30^\\circ\\!$ latitude would be $111 \\times \\cos (30^\\circ\\!) = 111 \\times 0.866 = 96$ meters.", "output": "Latitudes are \"parallels\" while longitudes are \"meridians\" that all meet at the poles.  For latitude, there is a set distance traveled per degree latitude no matter where you are on a spherical globe.  For longitude, it depends what latitude you are at.\n\n..........................  .............. \nImage source: https://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/LongitudeIntro.html\nImage Credit: Illinois State University\nHere is a nice calculator for you online:\nhttp://www.stevemorse.org/nearest/distance.php\n1 degree of latitude in physical distance is    68.94   statute miles or    59.91   nautical miles (110.95 km) -- for a spherical earth assumption.  So, a change of 0.001 degrees latitude is  0.06894 statute miles or    0.05991 nautical miles.  Though, an ellipsoidal earth approximation does have small variance in latitudinal distances.  Incidentally, longitude has the same distance between each degree if you are at the equator.  At the poles, the distance between lines of longitude is zero.

{"input": "\"What do you think about the new theme for Survivor Season 35?\"", "output": "Inside Survivor reveals the new title and theme for Season 35 of Survivor.\nInside Survivor can reveal that the title and theme for Survivor Season 35 will be Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers. Nope, this isn’t a very late April Fool’s joke. The thirty-fifth season recently wrapped up filming in Fiji’s Mamanuca Islands and will feature 18 brand new castaways divided into three tribes.\nThose of you subscribed to the Inside Survivor newsletter will be aware that casting was looking for contestants with specific occupations. During last year’s casting process, casting associates had put out notices requesting applications from those currently working as teachers, firefighters, and yoga instructors. It led to speculation that CBS was preparing to repeat the Worlds Apart theme, previously used in season thirty when castaways were divided into tribes of White Collar, Blue Collar, and No Collar.\nThe new theme – Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers (get used to saying that) – is essentially a variation on the Worlds Apart concept. While not as specific as the previous iteration, the tribe designations are likely to be decided based primarily on occupation. One would expect the Heroes tribe to include public service jobs such as firefighters, police officers, and teachers. The Healers, on the other hand, are more likely to be therapists, psychologists, and yoga instructors (spiritual healing). Whereas the Hustlers are probably salespeople and business executives.\nUPDATE 05/25/17: During the preview at the Game Changers reunion, Jeff Probst said the tribes are decided based on how others perceive them in their every day lives.\nSeason 35 will also mark the second time we’ve seen a “Heroes” tribe. The original Heroes tribe were part of the show’s epic all-star season, Heroes vs. Villains, and included famous Survivor faces such as Cirie Fields, Rupert Boneham, and Colby Donaldson.\nWhat do you think about the new theme? A step too far? Do we call it Survivor: HHH for short? Are you a hero, a healer or a hustler? Leave your comments below.\nClick here for the rumored Season 35 cast.\nWait, I still don’t fully understand what a hustler is.\nI just hope that they chose to add some location in front of the theme. Like maybe Mamanuca Islands should be this next season… Just a thought. Because it’s gonna be real impossible for me to spit those syllables out how they currently are.\nHeroes and Healers are the same tribe for me..\nCan we just get a normal season with normal people, 18 castaways, one survivor?\nThat’s what you’re getting in season 35. They only come up with the title/theme after the casting is finished with the exception of a few seasons. Also, heroes, hustlers and healers are plentiful in many of the Survivor seasons, so this is “normal people” for survivor.\nThat’s a myth. Most seasons they cast specifically for theme.\nPersonally, I’m all for Survivor: Back to Basics but we all know the likelihood of that happening is equal to how likely I am to date Kate Upton: Diddly-squat.\nDon’t give up i’m sure she’ll come around.\nIt doesn’t matter how ridiculousle the theme is, in the end of the day the thing that will make or brake the season is casting – and we all need a good, passionate cast after this season where it seemed like someone was forcing them to play.\nFor me Heroes and Healers are the same tribe.\nAs I see it, the theme is mainly about humoring Probst and his vision of Survivor. He does a good job in most respects so I’m willing to accept his cheese-ball conceits. In reality the theme is probably the least important aspect of the show and makes me cringe every time it is alluded to.\nI’m always for newbies, I wish they would just give up on returnees. Especially after this season which has been extremely boring. I hope they have cast some really great people and not too many models and life coaches (hustlers) although I see it is a young cast again. After this season they really owe us a fun cast..\nso two tribes are made out to be good people and one tribe of aholes?? is that FAIR?? Remember WAY back in the day where they went to a NEW location?? and it was so cool???? …. all i can say is the cast better be great.\nI’m with everyone else. What’s wrong with just good old Survivor, with no stupid themes?\nGuys! Haven’t we learnt that themes are merely marketing ploys, and that they don’t affect the quality of the season? Just last year, everyone scuffed at the Millennials vs. Gen X theme, but then we saw what an amazing season that turned out to be. Don’t take the themes too seriously, as we know that after four eliminations, there’ll be a tribe shuffle. Let’s just look forward to the obvious: NEW players!\nThe season title means nothing; it’s the content that matters, and it has been pretty good the past few years.\nI love themes, and I disagree that we should stop having them, but this is kind of ridiculous. Enterprisers vs. Entertainers vs. Enforcers vs. Energizers were what I wanted, but this isn’t much different, so I’m fine either way.\nThe best season was the Out Back. They were truly trying to Survive. Now, I think that the contestents look like they are gaining weight and not really working on their shelters and finding food. And we need some real villianous types..i.e., Russell Hann and that guy who told everyone his Grandma died.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The team uses a specially modified cargo plane to launch a special generator into the developing storm to enhance its power. As the plane is destroyed by a lightning strike, the control of the experiment is lost and within a few hours the storm develops into the hurricane Andrew which devastates Miami. The details about the experiments are buried after the disaster. The story then moves to 1999 where Dr. Ron Young Luke Perry and his assistant Dr. Brian Newmeyer perform the experiment designed to steer the path of the storm with the generator towed by a small airplane. While the experiment is successful, Dr. Youngs flight license is revoked because of the airspace violation which nearly causes the accident. His boss has enough of the risky experiments and decides to fire both Dr. Young and Dr. Newmeyer. Soon after this Ron is approached by a mysterious man named Tom Holt who knows many details of his research. He offers him a new job for the Zephyr Weather Dynamics based in Los Angeles. Though reluctant to move to the L.A., Ron accepts the offering while Dr. Newmeyer decides to stay at home. Ron is introduced to General Roberts who has revived the weather control project and wants Ron to help him achieve the goal of developing and steering the storms and hurricanes which could be used as a covert and deniable weapon of mass destruction. Ron is also introduced to the remainder of the team consisting unknown metheorologist Dr. Daniel Platt and Major Tanya Goodman who flies the C123 transport aircraft. Ron finds the activities suspicious and contacts Brian to find any information about the project and the people involved in it, although he is reminded of the covert work. He quickly finds out that the Zephyr Weather Dynamics is a continuation of the General Roberts failed weather control project. Ron helps the team to develop the weather control software for use in the improved version of the storm generator seen in the beginning of the film. After the generator is ready, General Roberts orders the team to launch it into the weather front off the U.S. West Coast to generate the hurricane and steer it to Mexico. The hurricane is successfully generated but the control of the generator is lost so Dr. Platt is sent airborne to try to reestablish a connection with the generator. When he succeeds, Dr. Platt decides to steer it away from Mexican coast. This enrages General Roberts who orders the immediate execution of Dr. Platt. With the death of Dr. Platt the control over the generator is lost and the hurricane steers to the north towards Los Angeles. After Ron discovers the General Roberts plans he starts to uncover more data about the experiment and also passes some secret information to Brian and Andrea McIntyre, a weather reporter working in L.A. who was dating him in the past. Soon after that Major Goodman invites Ron to dinner. They both get drunk and Ron falls asleep. The next morning Brians wife informs him that Brian has died in a car accident. Immediately after the call the police arrives and orders Ron to go with them because he is framed for killing of a woman and her daughter in the car accident. Believing that both Brians death and the charge he is facing are a revenge of General Roberts for sharing the topsecret information outside the team he escapes and infiltrates the company. He faces Major Goodman but is beaten down by Holt who brings him to General Roberts. It is revealed that Holt is a rogue CIA agent who staged both Brians death and blamed Ron for a hitand run accident he didnt commit. General Roberts then tells Ron about the coming destruction of L.A. and asks him for the help to recover the storm generator. He boards a plane piloted by Major Goodman and finds the generator. After a risky operation Ron manages to intercept the generator and switches it off manually. General Roberts then orders that the generator is released again and reactivated to steer the hurricane towards Mexico. Refusing to do so, Ron is first assaulted by Holt and later by Major Goodman. As she holds Ron at gunpoint, the plane hits the storm generator which destroys both plane and the generator. Ron manages to bail out with the parachute and is reunited with Andrea who reports from a nearly saved Los Angeles.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the history and context of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.", "output": "I wager that we could all recount the plot points of A Christmas Carol by heart. Furthermore, I wager that most of us inadvertently committed these to memory not by reading and re-reading Charles Dickens' 1843 novella (available in our Free eBooks and Free Audio Books collections), but by having seen or heard a different adaptation of it each Christmas. The work has produced an almost confusing abundance of productions on film, television, and the stage, from Thomas Edison's 1910 silent short to a Doctor Who Christmas special two years ago. Beyond that, we have countless reimaginings, like the animated Mickey's Christmas Carol featuring Scrooge McDuck as Ebenezer Scrooge, and loosely Christmas Carol-inspired projects, like Scrooged with Bill Murray. The story has also made its way to the radio many times, most notably in the 1930s, when Campbell's Soup would sponsor its yearly appearance. In 1939, the \"Campbell Playhouse\" brought in two especially formidable thespians, Orson Welles and Lionel Barrymore, and you can listen to the result at archive.org, or right below.\nWelles, of course, came in as no stranger to adapting literature for radio; he'd pulled off his infamously realistic Halloween dramatization of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds just the year before. My personal favorite of his adaptations remains the hauntingly askew Orson Welles Show version of Carl Ewald's My Little Boy, but I can't deny that he brings an entirely suitable tone of mild grandeur, initially stern but ultimately pleased, to A Christmas Carol. Barrymore, an actor of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who managed to succeed on stage, in silent films, and then in sound films, plays the now-archetypal miserly curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge with a style that, for my money, falls second only to Scrooge McDuck's. But then, we can't go comparing cartoon characters to flesh-and-blood performers, and Disney's Scrooge surely drew his own signature miserliness and curmudgeonhood (not to mention his name) from Dickens', a figure already firmly lodged in our collective holiday consciousness, thanks especially to performances like Barrymore's.\nColin Marshall hosts and produces Notebook on Cities and Culture and writes essays on literature, film, cities, Asia, and aesthetics.

{"input": "Describe the life and accomplishments of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Respond in 28 sentences.", "output": "On Feb. 14, 1974, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian writer who revealed the horrors of the Soviet gulag, was charged with treason a day after being deported to West Germany.\nHe also interviewed other prisoners and memorized what they said; he drew on these interviews to write his most famous work, “The Gulag Archipelago,” an account of Russian gulags.\n“It turned a mealy-mouthed, bureaucratic, obscure term describing the state management of labor camps—that crazy little word Gulag has now become a metaphor on the scale, almost, of the Holocaust,” says biographer Michael Scammell.\nParts of the piece were published in Paris in December 1973 after being smuggled out of the USSR. The book attracted tremendous attention in the West and changed the way many people felt about the USSR. It was also smuggled back into the Soviet Union, which prompted Soviet authorities to take action against Solzhenitsyn.\nOn Feb. 12, 1974, seven KGB agents took Solzhenitsyn from his home in Moscow and transported him to Lefortovo Prison, where he was strip-searched, interrogated for hours, and told he would face the death penalty. The next day Solzhenitsyn was flown to Frankfurt, Germany. A day later, the Soviet Union formally expelled Solzhenitsyn on charges of treason.\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn was born on Dec. 11, 1918, in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus region of Russia. Although he always wanted to be a writer, for financial reasons he studied physics and mathematics at Rostov University. He entered the military during World War II and commanded a squadron in East Prussia before he was arrested for criticizing Stalin.\nHe developed a cancerous tumor in 1950 and nearly died before he was allowed into a cancer clinic in 1954. After his imprisonment, he was exiled for three years. In 1956 he was allowed to return to Russia, where he taught math in a small village and wrote in secret.\n“During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known,” he wrote for his Nobel Prize autobiography.\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev took power, many Stalinist policies were loosened, and Solzhenitsyn submitted “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich” to a literary journal in the USSR. It was published in 1962 and in English a year later. Solzhenitsyn became famous in the USSR and continued to write, publishing two short stories.\nBut Khrushchev was forced out of power in 1964 and the policies that had been relaxed were tightened. Solzhenitsyn’s criticism of the government earned him harassment and publishing prohibitions. He was forced to publish his work abroad, illegally, which did not endear him to Soviet authorities.\nHe was expelled from the Soviet Writers’ Union in 1969 after he denounced state censorship. A year later he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, but refrained from attending the award ceremony as he was afraid he wouldn't be allowed to return to Russia.\nAfter his expulsion and move to America, he “became a cause celebre in the West, where he continued to study and write works largely critical of the Soviet regime,” according to The Daily Telegraph.\nAs the Soviet Union fell, interest in Solzhenitsyn’s work rose among citizens there. A literary magazine published excerpts of “The Gulag Archipelago” in 1989, and his citizenship was restored in 1990. He died in Moscow in August 2008 of heart failure.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "The risk of a major oil spill in the Salish Sea due to the proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline by Kinder Morgan Canada.", "output": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Canada, January 24, 2013 (ENS) – Canadian environmental groups today warned that a new proposal by Kinder Morgan pipeline company would “exponentially” raise the risk of a major oil spill in the Salish Sea’s most populous region, including the cities of Vancouver and Victoria.\nThe insurance available to cover response costs and damages of such a spill would fall short, leaving Canadian taxpayers to pay up to 90 percent of these costs, finds a report by the Georgia Strait Alliance, Living Oceans Society, West Coast Environmental Law and the Wilderness Committee.\nThe Salish Sea is the network of coastal waterways between the southwestern tip of the Canadian province of British Columbia, and the northwestern tip of the U.S. state of Washington, including the Strait of Georgia, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound.\nThe groups’ report follows a January 10 announcement by Kinder Morgan Canada that the company now proposes to enlarge capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day from a previously planned 750,000 bpd.\nThe current Trans Mountain Pipeline runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, British Columbia. The company has announced plans to build a C$5.4 billion new pipeline in parallel to it. The new pipeline would bring total capacity to 890,000 barrels per day, mostly crude oil to be shipped to Asia via oil tankers from Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver located on Burrard Inlet.\n“Thirteen customers in the Canadian producing and oil marketing business have now signed binding, long-term contracts, which demonstrates the need for this proposed expansion that will serve both existing and new markets,” said Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada.\nSome of the product planned for the new pipeline is heavy bitumen from the Alberta tar sands.\n“Ever since they took control of the Transmountain Pipeline and Westridge Terminal in 2005 Kinder Morgan has worked to quietly increase tar sands oil exports through their pipeline and onto to tankers in Vancouver Harbour,” said Wilderness Committee campaigner Ben West last March.\nNow, between 70-90 Aframax oil tankers a year travel through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, across the Strait of Georgia, into Vancouver harbor and up Burrard Inlet. Each oil tanker can carry up to 750,000 barrels of oil.\nIf Kinder Morgan’s plan to build a new pipeline were to be approved, at least 300 oil tankers a year would be plying these waters. Larger Suezmax tankers are planned, which would require the dredging of Burrard Inlet.\n“The proposed escalation from 80 tankers per year to 400 or more into Kinder Morgan’s Westridge Terminal in Burnaby, combined with other plans to expand shipping on the south coast, equals a phenomenal increase in the risk of a serious oil spill,” said Brenda Belak, of West Coast Environmental Law.\n“The risk of oil spills is one of the main reasons that the majority of British Columbians on the Kinder Morgan tanker and pipeline route oppose the project,” said Belak.\nThe groups’ report reviews the insurance structure set up by the International Maritime Organization after the Exxon Valdez disaster, which limits the liability of oil shippers and sets up funds that can be drawn on in the event of a major oil spill. Canada is signatory to all of these agreements.\n“Taken together, all four of the funds that respond to major oil spills would provide only $1.34 billion, or about one-tenth of the estimated cost of a major spill,” explained Karen Wristen of Living Oceans Society.\nA study by the Washington State Department of Ecology, conducted in 2004, concluded that a major spill would cost 165,000 jobs and US$10.8 billion in economic impacts in Washington State alone. This does not include individual claims or environmental impacts.\nA study released last month by the University of British Columbia looked at spills on the Enbridge Northern Gateway tanker route and estimated a major spill would cause C$9 billion in damage to the North Coast economy.\nThe Salish Sea is inhabited by killer whales, at least 200 species of fish, over 1,500 species of invertebrates, 100 species of marine birds, and about 500 species of marine plants.\nBritish Columbia’s Fraser River is the largest producer of salmon on the Pacific coast of North America.\nThe region is home to over seven million people who live around the shores of Puget Sound, Georgia Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\nThe memory of the Exxon Valdez oil spill that devastated Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989 informs the groups’ report.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has estimated that even if the Exxon Valdez been a double-hulled tanker such as the ones that are proposed to serve the Kinder Morgan terminal, it would still have ruptured. The spill might have been reduced by 25 to 40 percent, but it would still have wiped out the herring fishery and devastated the economy of Alaska’s Cordova Bay, the groups point out.\nPresently, Kinder Morgan is conducting outreach and consultation with land owners, First Nations, businesses, local governments, and other stakeholders. The company hopes to file a formal application to the National Energy Board in late 2013, have construction start in 2016, and be shipping oil by 2017.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "\"The case of Valentino Dixon, and why golfers should care\"", "output": "After 27 years in prison, a man who loves golf walked free today. Not only that, he was given back his innocence. Of course, the state can regift innocence about as capably as it can 27 years.\nNevertheless, the Erie County District Court in Buffalo, N.Y., has vacated the murder conviction of Valentino Dixon, 48, who was serving a 39-years-to-life sentence—the bulk of it in the infamous Attica Correctional Facility—for the 1991 killing of Torriano Jackson. On that hot August night long ago, both were at a loud street party with underage drinking when a fistfight over a girl turned to gunfire.\nBut before we dive into what really happened, a quick refresher on why golfers might care extra about Valentino Dixon. Six years ago, Golf Digest profiled this inmate who grinds colored pencils to their nubs drawing meticulously detailed golf-scapes. Although Dixon has never hit a ball or even stepped foot on a course, the game hooked him when a golfing warden brought in a photograph of Augusta National’s 12th hole for the inmate to render as a favor. In the din and darkness of his stone cell, the placid composition of grass, sky, water and trees spoke to Dixon. And the endless permutations of bunkers and contours gave him a subject he could play with.\nA sampling of Dixon's golf illustrations.\nIt took about a hundred drawings before Golf Digest noticed, but when we did, we also noticed his conviction seemed flimsy. So we investigated the case and raised the question of his innocence.\nThe case is complicated, but on the surface it involves shoddy police work, zero physical evidence linking Dixon, conflicting testimony of unreliable witnesses, the videotaped confession to the crime by another man, a public defender who didn’t call a witness at trial, and perjury charges against those who said Dixon didn’t do it. All together, a fairly clear instance of local officials hastily railroading a young black man with a prior criminal record into jail. Dixon’s past wasn’t spotless, he had sold some cocaine, but that didn’t make him a murderer.\nGolf Digest’s 2012 article led to further national spotlights on the case by NBC/Golf Channel, CRTV.com, Fox Sports, the Georgetown University Prison Reform Project and others. Alongside this, Dixon’s daughter, Valentina, led a grassroots campaign to raise money for her father’s legal fees by selling his artwork online. Still, the gears of the legal system refused to turn. As of Christmas 2017, appeals exhausted, Dixon’s petitions for pardon or clemency drew no response from New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s office.\nBut now suddenly, a vacated conviction—which means innocence—a far more lofty legal victory. Why now?\nDixon rubbed colored pencils to their nubs while drawing.\nAlso not to be discounted is the value of fresh blood. Frank Sedita III, the longtime Erie County district attorney who’s said that society ought to be more concerned with “wrongful acquittals,” is out. The new man, John Flynn, has been in the job a year, and it’s basically due to his blessing that Dixon was released.\nOf course, one small matter to be addressed before a man’s guilt is absolved is to place it on someone else. Just before Dixon walked out of the courthouse, LaMarr Scott walked in and officially plead guilty to Jackson’s murder. Scott admitted responsibility the night of the shooting and has for decades since (including to Golf Digest), with the exception of a brief window of time when Belling pressured him to say otherwise. Scott is already serving a life sentence for a 1993 shooting in an armed robbery that left one victim a quadriplegic. Tacking on a concurrent sentence for Jackson’s murder doesn’t change his prospects, other than maybe making any future parole a slimmer possibility.\nWhere’s Dixon heading after the courthouse? “I’m going to Red Lobster to celebrate with my family and my support team, then we’re going to go a park,” he said. The next day he’s going to visit his grandmother, and the day after that he’s going to buy a cellphone and register for a passport at the post office so he can visit his wife of 12 years, Louise, who lives in Australia.

{"input": "Is vigorous drumming an effective exercise?\n\nFrom the \"any exercise is better than no exercise\" perspective, I'd imagine that playing drums at high tempo would be considered effective - it certainly can work up a sweat and obviously must burn more calories than just sitting on the couch, but it's hard to say how effective it actually is without hard numbers. Are there any reliable sources which can provide MET or actual calorie burn data by which we could compare drumming with other exercises?\nAlso, while it's obviously physically taxing beyond a certain level of skill, does drumming actually raise the heart rate enough to really count as cardio?\n\nA:\n\nUpon further research I stumbled upon this gem from Arizona State University, which catalogs the MET values of various activities. Under the Music Playing category, they list \"drums, sitting\" as 3.8 METs and \"drumming (e.g., bongo, conga, benbe), moderate, sitting\" as 3.0 METs, so it seems like the that the forum post claiming ~498 kcal/hr for a 250lb male isn't too far off.\nOf course I'd still love to see data from a heart rate monitor during play. The above establishes that drumming (even on plastic toy drums) is definitely exercise, but is it a viable form of cardio?\nUpdate I found this BBC article in which professional drummer Clem Burke was hooked up to equipment to measure heart rate, oxygen uptake and lactic acid production. It was found that during a performance his heart rate averaged 140-150 BPM with peaks up to 190 BPM, comparable to top athletes. Not only does this show that expert-level drumming can be effective cardio, but there's even a dedicated \"drumming laboratory\" being built at the University of Glouchestershire to continue the study.\n\nA:\n\nA trainer did research on me over a 3 month period as a part of his bachelors studies in sessions twice a week, one hour each. The subject (me) is a 37 (36 at the time) year old metal drummer with 22 years behind the kit who puts in about an hour behind the kit on average pr. day and does no other exercise. Here's some data.\nAverage resting heart-rate: 49.\nBody fat: 8%.\nAverage heart rate while drumming: 156.\nPeak heart rate while drumming: 203.\nI need a strict high-calorie diet to maintain my body weight.\nYou may not acquire a bodybuilder's physique by drumming but stating that regular vigorous drumming does not build muscle is nonsense; drumming is a full body workout which will particularly build your entire lower body muscles, lower back, abs, shoulders, triceps and forearms.", "output": "Well, as an exercise physiologist, drumming (e.g., playing a kit vigorously) is indeed exercise.  What most people fail to get about what they consider exercise is that it mimics and is a substitute for, real functional work. Your body doesn't care if it's lifting logs or weights.  It doesn't care if your 150 bpm cardio workout is from a bike or playing double bass - all your body knows is that, \"hey, my heart is beating faster & I need to remodel myself & the vascular system so I can adapt to this workload\".\nIn short, nope, drumming is not running marathons & it's not lifting weights to failure...  However, if you're playing vigorously and sustained, if the heart rate is within the ranges necessary to illicit a response (according to my Polar the average is indeed), it is exercise - valid, cardiovascular exercise with all the benefits of \"real\" cardio.  In addition, it uses all 4 limbs & the core for stabilization, unlike running or cycling (little to no upper body).  It doesn't receive the benefits of being weight bearing as does running, but neither does cycling.\nTo conclude, if you're playing vigorously and regularly you're getting a decent cardio workout.  You'd never train beyond a certain level - would never really experience the benefits of overloading to constantly push for increased benefits - but the benefits would remain.

A hearing on the matter was set for Aug. 31.\nIn a news release, agency director Kelly Susewind said the department planned to shoot the wolves from helicopters or on the ground. “The evidence shows that non-lethal measures have not been successful, and the pack will continue preying on livestock unless we take action to change its behavior,” Susewind said.\nThe agency uses a policy of incremental removal, killing one or a few wolves at a time.\nThe Center for Biological Diversity and Cascadia Wildlands immediately sued, contending the order to kill wolves failed to undergo an environmental analysis.\n“It’s outrageous that Washington wildlife officials want to kill more wolves from the state’s small and recovering wolf population,” said Amaroq Weiss of the Center for Biological Diversity.\nSince 2012, the state has killed 18 wolves, eradicating three entire wolf packs, the environmental groups said.\nIn the case of the Togo pack, the attacks on cattle started last November, with an injured calf. The rancher took numerous steps to deter wolves, including using lights and range riders, the agency said.\nBut three dead cows and two more injured calves were discovered in the next 10 months, including an injured calf found Saturday on a U.S. Forest Service grazing allotment in Ferry County.\n“The injured calf had bite lacerations and bite puncture wounds to the outside lower left hindquarter, the left hamstring, the inside of the left hock and the groin area,” the agency said. The wounds were consistent with a wolf attack, officials said.\nThe last estimate of Togo pack size was two adult wolves and an unknown number of pups, the agency said. The existence of the Togo pack, found near the U.S.-Canada border, was only confirmed in late 2017.\nWolves were wiped out in Washington early in the last century. They started to return from Canada and Idaho in the past 20 years. Washington confirmed its first breeding pack in 2008.\nThe wolves are federally protected in the western two-thirds of the state and protected by law statewide.\nThe latest count of wolves, conducted last winter, found a minimum of 122 wolves in 22 packs, with 14 successful breeding pairs. Most packs are in northeastern Washington, where there have been numerous conflicts with cattle producers.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the Moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and nonhuman tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spiderlike creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walkers chest; Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source. Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty, but he accidentally damages the system controls, causing Liberty to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their lunar rover. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the Moon, because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth. Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to the crater where they found the cosmonaut. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK. Anderson uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control who connect him to the Department of Defence. The deputy secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to Freedom. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing he had survived the alien encounter earlier. However, he is now completely psychotic and demands to be let in. When Anderson refuses to let him in, he tries to break the landers window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is attacked by a swarm of creatures inside his helmet, which causes his head to explode, killing him. Anderson launches, but the DoD warns Grey that Anderson is infected and orders him to abort the rescue or communication will be cut off, without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth. The landers engines shut off as it enters orbit, and it is in free fall. Small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be alien creatures. Anderson is attacked and infected by the creatures, preventing him from controlling the vehicle. Grey tells Anderson that he is moving too fast as the LK crashes into Freedom killing them both. The space footage ends abruptly. The footage cuts to before the pilots mission, showing them having a barbecue with friends and family. The official fate of the astronauts is given, describing them as having died in various accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable.

The traditional bar scene plays a less important role in college students' lives, as more turn to Facebook, texting and other social media to plan their evenings, leaving bars looking for ways to draw them back.\nThere’s no shortage of media coverage of drunken excess on college campuses. Just this week, the New York Times filled us in on how social media facilitates students’ expedient drinking and hooking up — so much so that traditional collegetown bars are becoming obsolete and closing shop in towns like Ithaca, N.Y., home of Cornell University.\nSuch extreme stories would have us believe that college kids are out of control, even drunker and higher than their parents before them. Actually, though, that’s not the case. Properly collected study data — which has gone unmentioned in recent media trend stories — suggest that today’s college students aren’t misusing alcohol or drugs at any higher rates than their parents did. For example, according to the newly released 2011 results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among people aged 18 to 25, just under 40% binged on alcohol in the past month, down slightly from nearly 42% in 2003. Most surveys of people this age conducted since the early 1980s show similar rates.\nEven on prescription drug misuse, the news is good. Past-month nonmedical use of prescription drugs among people of college age fell 14% from 2010 to 2011. And the overall percentage of people over 12 who used painrelievers nonmedically in the past month has been stable at roughly 2% since 2002, with the current figure at 1.7%. The same is true for the percent of the population who have diagnosable problems with prescription pain drugs: it’s just under 1% and has been since 2002.\nAs for the recent Times story, “Last Call for College Bars,” the newspaper apparently got played by a group of drunken students, who lied about their names — and possibly about their other experiences as well. So, here’s a hint to the rest of the media covering youthful misbehavior: if you want actual trend data, the National Household Survey on Drugs and the Monitoring the Future survey are both reliable, annually updated sources — and they won’t lie about their names, either.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "I need to choose a marriage counselor, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you give me 12 actionable steps?", "output": "1. Search for marriage counselors.: The first step in finding a marriage counselor is to see which counselors practice in your area. You can look up therapists in your local phone book, by searching online, or by using a reputable therapist database, such as Psychology Today's Find a Therapist page.\n\nOnline databases let you search by area, by specialty, and by accepted insurance plans.\nYou can also ask your primary care physician for recommendations/referrals. If you trust your primary doctor, it's probably safe to trust their recommendations.\nIf any trustworthy friends or family members have gone through marriage counseling, you might consider asking them for recommendations. You may however not wish to do this if you don't want others to know you're seeking counseling.\nA licensed marriage counselor will have the title Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) or similar depending where you are but you can speak to a counselor that is not an LMFT and has relevant experience.\nWhile a regular counselor or psychologist may have experience working with couples, it's important to find a therapist who has the specialized experience that you need. Ask the counselor about their training and credentials. Additionally, you should ask which area of couples therapy they specializes in, such as marriage counseling after infidelity or after the loss of a child.\n2. Look up the therapist's location.: Once you've found some counselors in your area, you should look up where each counselor practices and how you would get there. Depending on where you live, commuting from one side of town to the other (or even the next town over) might be very difficult. You may also want to factor in modes of transportation. If you do not own a car and rely on public transit, check a transit map to see how close to each counselor you can get, as well as how long that commute would take.\n3. Consider each counselor's availability.: Some counselors work within the usual 9:00 to 5:00 workday hours, which could make it difficult to meet if you or your spouse work a job with rigid hours. Many counselors work on weekends or later in the day to accommodate working patients, although depending on your schedule that may be even less convenient.\n\nIf you're signing up for marriage counseling, you want to ensure that you and your partner will be able to make it to every session.\nChoose a counselor whose practice hours coincide with your (and your partner's) schedule.\n4. Compare costs.: A big factor in any medical treatment may be the costs associated with seeing a doctor, and therapy is no different. If you have health insurance, check with a representative from your insurance company to see if your plan covers counseling. You should also look into the estimated cost of counseling, both with insurance (if your plan covers it, most don't) and without.\n\nCheck with your insurance company if counseling/therapy is covered. Most insurance companies will not pay for marriage counseling itself. If one of you has a relevant diagnosis, the therapist may use this to bill your insurance plan. You may only be covered for therapists within a specified network or practice.\nAsk the counselor you're interested in if they offer a sliding scale. Many therapists recognize that some people do not have a comprehensive insurance plan (or any insurance at all), and are willing to work with those patients at a reduced rate.\n5. Check the therapist's education.: In order to become a licensed marriage and family therapist, a counselor needs to have completed one of three educational requirements. A marriage counselor may have earned a master's degree (which takes two to three years to complete), a doctoral program (which takes three to five years to complete), or a post-graduate clinical training program (which typically takes between three and four years to complete).\n\nTypically, after graduating from an accredited program, a counselor will complete a mandatory post-degree supervised clinical training program. This is usually required, regardless of the counselor's degree earned.\nYou may also find a PhD-level licensed professional counselor (LPC) or psychologist with extensive experience counseling couples.\n6. Make sure the therapist is licensed.: In addition to ensuring that a given counselor has the right background, it's also a good idea to confirm that that therapist is licensed. Depending on which state or location you reside in, a marriage counselor may be required to pass a state/regional  licensing exam, the national examination administered by the Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards (AMFTRB), or both or similar qualifications relevant to where you live.\nYou can often find information about a given therapist's licensing status by checking that therapist's website. If you cannot find that information there, ask the therapist directly.\n7. Ask about professional organizations.: Though a therapist is not required to join a professional organization/association, it's usually a good sign when a therapist is a member of one. A therapist's membership indicates that she has a personal interest in counseling, as well as a desire to continue to learn and adapt their practice with new trends in the field.\n\nOne of the biggest professional organizations for marriage counselors is the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapists (AAMFT).\n\nAAMFT requires supervised training and mandatory coursework of all members to ensure quality and consistency.\n8. Compare strategies and treatment plans.: Different therapists have differing approaches to therapy. It's important to get a sense of how a therapist would proceed if you were to begin sessions with them.\n\nAsk the therapist how they would want to proceed with treatment, and whether they use any particular therapeutic modality in their practice. Then read up about that treatment plan to see if you think it could help you.\n\nA good therapist will suggest different techniques and treatment strategies for you to work on at home between sessions.\nFind out about the therapist's projected treatment plan. You should specifically ask how many sessions you can expect to have, how long each session will last, and what kind of timetable you can expect for results.\n9. Ask your therapist's opinion on divorce.: It may seem like a strange question to ask a marriage counselor you're interested in working with, but it can also be a very important thing to know. Some marriage counselors urge their clients to leave the marriage when things get rocky, either because of the therapist's beliefs or their unwillingness to continue working through problems. This may be the mark of a poor therapist for your needs, especially if you're committed to working through your problems no matter what.\nYou should specifically ask the therapist at what point they considers divorce to be a viable option and when they think you should try to stop or avoid it.\n10. Determine your therapist's values.: Each therapist brings their own set of values to the practice of marriage counseling, which can be good, bad, or neutral. However, those values shouldn't intrude on your therapy in problematic ways. It's important to determine what your therapist's values are to ensure that they will be a good fit for you and your partner moving forward.\n\nIf a therapist says there is only one way to have a successful marriage, you should consider finding someone else to work with.\nAsk a therapist you're interested in what their personality is like. That may give you some insight into how well they'd  fit with you and your spouse.\n\nDetermine what kinds of patients the therapist works with before you describe your problem. That way you'll know whether he can help you right off the bat.\nDescribe yourself, your spouse, and your marital problem(s). Ask the counselor how they think the first session or two might go when dealing with that problem to get a sense of what to expect.\n11. Look for evidence-based approaches.: There are many therapeutic approaches that are generally recognized as being effective and medically sound. It may be a good idea to find out what kinds of therapeutic approaches your counselor uses to see if they would fit well with your needs. Two common evidence-based approaches to marriage counseling are Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy and the Gottman Method.\n\nEmotionally-Focused Couples Therapy works to rebuild the foundation of marriage by focusing on repairing trust, fostering emotional intimacy, and rekindling feelings of love and affection.\nThe Gottman Method works to rebuild a marriage by first changing the behaviors of each partner. This method emphasizes communication skills, conflict resolution, strengthening the friendship within a marriage, and being more caring/considerate partners to one another.\n12. Evaluate your progress.: Marriage counseling should not feel like a never-ending pursuit. Early in the counseling, you and your partner should set concrete goals with your therapist so that the ensuing sessions have some direction and focus. Each subsequent session should have those goals in mind and should work to help you and your partner find ways to meet your goals.\n\nYou won't see results overnight, but if you haven't seen any improvement in your marriage after several weeks' worth of sessions, you may want to consider looking for another therapist.\n\nA good therapist should make both spouses feel respected and heard. If your therapist takes sides or \"gangs up\" on you or your spouse, you should consider looking for another therapist.\n\nDon't get frustrated. Saving a marriage takes time and effort from both you and your partner, you won't be able to do it alone. If the therapist you're seeing isn't helping you reach your clearly-defined goals, it's worth your marriage to find one who will.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe some of the ways you can protect your privacy in today's technology-driven world.", "output": "This a short post about what you can do to protect your privacy in today’s world. Though nothing is 100% safe and as long as people are using technology, their privacy can be threatened. Yet, without technology – life’s just no good.\nThey are collecting mountains of data on you, selling it to advertisers and loaning it to government agencies. Seriously, limit or stop all use of these services. Instead of using Google search I’d suggest checking out DuckDuckGo.com, a free software project that doesn’t profile or track its users search queries.\nThere’s not much choice between browsers, but Firefox is the most open in the main gang. It is open source, which is a plus, and it’s not owned by a giant corp that’s part of the PRISM surveillance program like Apple (Safari) and Google (Chrome).\nGhostery. Free but proprietary. Wikipedia describes it as enabling “its users to easily detect and control web bugs which are objects embedded in a web page, invisible to the user, that allow the collection of data on the user’s browsing habits.” This means it stops the various servers owned by large corps such as Google, Facebook, Twitter from automatically tracking when you visit a website with their embedded code in it.\nAdBlock Plus. This is another free and open source extension similar to Ghostery, but aimed at automatically blocking ads. Apart from being useful to stop annoying intrusions, it blocks ad servers from tracking you.\nThis simply allows you to have physical control over when you want to be connected to the Internet. If your system is compromised, even if it appears that your computer is not connected, it could still be sending packets. Being able to pull the plug at a moments notice is valuable.\nThis will simply allow you to decide what connects in and out of your system. There are a ton out there, so have a look for yourself. One thing to note is if you torrent a firewall app, there’s a chance it could compromise your entire system. It’s probably best to be legit here. You’ll be amazed at the amount of apps which constantly try to “phone home” to their servers.\nThis item is linked to a point in the above section about torrenting software. I’m not going to tell you what to do in regards to torrenting, but be aware when you’re downloading and installing random software, there’s a chance it’s either completely backdoored or contains some level of spyware. If you don’t NEED it, go without.\nFind out whether the chat apps you use have OTR compatibility, and if so turn it on. This enables end to end encryption between you and to whomever you’re talking, so passive snooping cannot take place.\nPGP (pretty good privacy) for email allows you to send and receive encrypted emails. You need to generate your own public key signature and share it with your friends. The catch is that they need to do the same (which can be frustrating). Be aware that your email content is the only thing encrypted, and anyone looking in will still be able to see other meta data.\nPassword managers are great for generating and storing long complicated passwords so you don’t have to memorize them all. The idea is that you can generate a brand new password for every single service or account you use, compartmentalizing any risk, so if one of those services is breached, everything else you use isn’t automatically too. Make sure that you have a strong, memorable master password.\nIf your system is ever lost, compromised or stolen, it’ll be more likely that your files will remain untouched if they’re encrypted. Same goes for sending important files over the Internet. Think about sending them as encrypted files. Also, look into full disk encryption for your computer. There are plenty of tutorials online to suit your particular set up.\nThis may seem a little paranoid, but if you don’t ever use it, you may as well get rid of it. There is still a chance that your microphone is being listened in on. It’s another way of mitigating the data that can be collected on you. You can always plug in headphones with a built-in mic when you need one.\nIf you’re working on sensitive material, you might consider using the Tor browser bundle. It automatically obfuscates your IP address and provides a decent level of protection. There are some theories that it may have been broken, but they haven’t been proven (yet), so be aware.\nA VPN or virtual private network encrypts your network data through a server (or servers) and makes web requests on your behalf. This means when you visit websites, your IP address will appear as wherever the VPN’s server is making the request from. They’re good for stopping automatic ISP snooping, but they are not a magic bullet. Remember you are placing your trust in the VPN service and some may not deserve it.\nSeriously. This is not something most people would be willing to do but if you really care about your privacy, you should ditch the phone (aka George Orwell’s worst nightmare). Think about it, this thing tracks your location in realtime, your movement habits, it knows who you are in contact with, it knows the exact relationship with each person and what you say to them. It knows what apps you use, what you browse for, how you browse, what you buy, what you don’t buy, what people in your life look like and their location (with photos and geo tagging).\nI mean for god sake that’s insane. Phones are much less configurable than computers so you have even less control of your data. If you’re not willing to do that, then at least remove the battery from your phone (if you can), when you’re not using it.\nIt is definitelly hard to stop using a mobile phone now adays. I normally send more sms than making phone calls which is a bit safer.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

In order to investigate some intelligence which he had picked up in Italy, Engles offers Blair a new job because he trusts him he used to be Blairs commanding officer. He wants Blair to keep him posted on the activities of everyone who stays at a ski hut, whilst he poses as a scriptwriter. Blair accepts this offer. Engles warns him to look out for a Carla Rometta and sends along a cameraman, Joe Wesson, to accompany him. At the inn, Aldo, the indifferent innkeeper, tells themthat there are no rooms available, however guest Stefano Valdini helps them to find a room. Englishman Gilbert Mayne also takes a room. Blair soon encounters Rometta, who calls herself the Comtessa Forelli. That night, a Greek named Keramikos also arrives. When Blair makes his first report, Engles is particularly interested in the fact that the hut is to be auctioned off the next day. The proprietor of the hotel below confides to Blair that the auction is rigged and that there will only be one bid, his, but instead there is a heated bidding war involving Valdini on the Comtessas behalf and a lawyer for an unknown party. The latter wins the auction by making an excessive bid. Keramikos tells Blair that he is not truly there to write a script. He also claims that Mayne was a deserter from the British Army who ended up working for him in Greece, though he declines to divulge any more. Blair begins falling in love with the comtessa, who admits she is Carla. Very late at night, by chance, Blair spots Keramikos speaking German with another man. However, when Blair confronts Keramikos, the Greek tells him to mind his own business. The next day, Mayne invites Blair to go skiing. Refusing to answer any of Blairs questions on this trip, Mayne leaves him behind. When Blair crashes he is knocked unconscious. Mayne later telephones Wesson to inform him that Blair is missing. Carla overhears and telephones Mancini, who organises a search party. Blair is found unconscious, but is brought to safety and recovers quickly. Engles shows up, just before a snowstorm that leaves all the parties stranded in the hut for the night. At dinner, Engles identifies Keramikos as Von Kellerman. Kellerman reveals he was a Gestapo special agent in charge of Venice, and that Engles was a colonel in British Intelligence. When Italy switched sides and joined the Allies, Kellerman was ordered to transport the gold reserves of the Bank of Italy to Germany. He assigned the task to Captain Heinrich Stelben, unaware Stelben was enamoured with Carla Rometta. In turn, Stelben did not know that Carla had transferred her affections to Mayne. At Carlas urging, Stelben left the gold at the hut and, after shooting his own men, reported he had been ambushed. The badly wounded Corporal Holtz survived and was later persuaded to relate his story to Kellerman. Kellerman wants the gold to finance the rebuilding of a fascist Germany. When Carla attacks Mayne after learning that he had agreed to kill her and Valdini, he knocks her unconscious. Valdini throws a knife at him. Mayne shoots him dead, but is knifed in the back by Aldo on Kellermans order. Kellerman produces a pistol, has Carla locked up, and orders the Englishmen to dig for the gold. Mayne comes to and tries to free Carla, but knocks over a lamp that sets the building on fire, then succumbs. When no gold is found, Kellerman does not believe that Engles does not know where it is and shoots him. In the ensuing fight, Wesson drags the unconscious Blair out of the basement. The burning hut collapses on the others. Carla reveals that she knows where the gold is, but cradling Blair, declares she will never reveal its location, as it has caused too many deaths.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5 billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2 AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, as a result of the vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600 K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700 current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.As the Sun expands, it will swallow the planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; although the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) will cause the planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up as a result of tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11 times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770 K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100 million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500 K. This phase lasts about 30 million years, after which, over the course of a further 100,000 years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.\"", "output": "Keith was playing a simulation game.

The set will also be available at FanExpo Canada later this year, as well as in limited quantities online after Comic-Con at the Hasbro Toy Shop.\nIntroduced in Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca’s Darth Vader ongoing in 2016, Aphra and her droids (enhanced with programming that basically turned them into killer versions of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the best ways possible) were recruited by Vader to help him work his way back up in the Emperor’s esteem after the failure of the first Death Star.

{"input": "What's the deal with Amazon's data centers?", "output": "Amazon, through negotiated tax incentives and secret deals with power companies and politicians, has perfected the art of sticking rural Americans with the tab for their power-hungry data centers, reports Bloomberg.\nMeanwhile, data centers typically add few new jobs to rural counties. \"When you attracted the steel mill years ago, you got 2,000 employees,\" says Neal Elliott, senior director of research at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a green lobbying group. \"When you attract a data center, you get maybe 50.\"\nDespite this, desperate state politicians scrambling to replace shrinking manufacturing industries have worked closely with utility companies to score Amazon data center contracts, \"using the company's name as a shorthand for economic resurgence.\"\nIn Virginia, where Amazon’s Vadata Inc. is believed to operate at least 29 data centers and be planning 11 more, the company’s 78-page application for a special rate agreement has two versions—a heavily redacted public one and another under seal with state regulators.\n\"That’s de facto cost-­shifting,\" according to Ohio State University economist Ned Hill. \"Other businesses and households in Ohio are now bearing all the costs of those riders.\"\nThose \"other businesses\" include Facebook, which opened a $759 million data center in Ohio in 2017. \"As a general practice, we do not negotiate exclusive rates,\" said spokeswoman Melanie Roe.\nAmazon has nearly doubled the size of its physical footprint worldwide over the last two years - boasting 254 million square feet, which includes dozens of new data centers with racks upon racks of power-hungry servers running 24/7. It has also benefitted $1.2 billion in state and municipal tax incentives it's received over the past decade, along with untold millions of dollars its negotiated with local utilities and politicians.\nAside from tax incentives, the cost of routing power to the data centers has been passed directly on to locals. After the company's planned data center in Gainesville, Virginia required Dominion Energy, Inc. to run a hotly contested aboveground power line straight through a Civil War Battlefield, residents like 87-year-old Rosie Thomas and her neighbors petitioned and protested in front of the gated data center, \"skirmishes punctuated by barking dogs and shooting police.\" The result was that Dominion agreed to bury that part of the line along the highway at an estimated cost of $172 million.\nWhat happened next? Gainesville locals were stuck with the bill.\nAnd who's privy to the value of Amazon's Ohio rate deal? The state's five-person public utility commission and the publicly funded but privatized economic development agency, JobsObio. Amazon maintains that the value of their discount is a trade secret, and one clause in their contract stipulates that it will not face public review for at least five years, at which point Amazon can request that report be redacted.\n“Price cuts are treated as trade secrets by the utilities. Baloney,” says Ned Hill. “All should be made public and made in advance of any action,” with key documents posted online.\n\"If these discounts are generating the kind of economic bounty officials claim, why aren’t they willing to show us what the discounts are?\" wonders Zach Schiller of left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio.\n“Amazon had a huge advantage, because there weren’t a lot of other sectors growing in the electricity market,” says Elliott, the ACEEE senior research director.\nBloomberg's bottom line: It’s tough to know just how much of Amazon’s electricity and infrastructure costs other people are bearing, but in Virginia, the tab starts at $172 million.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Describe the paper \"The Smartphone Royalty Stack: Surveying Royalty Demands for the Components Within Modern Smartphones\" by Intel, WilmerHale, and explain its implications.", "output": "A working paper by an Intel in-house counsel and two WilmerHale lawyers, The Smartphone Royalty Stack: Surveying Royalty Demands for the Components Within Modern Smartphones, has just been published (direct link to PDF). Intel Vice President and Associate General Counsel Ann Armstrong and WilmerHale's Joseph Mueller and Timothy Syrett have made an invaluable contribution to the debate over reasonable royalties and incentives for innovation in this field.\nThis first-rate paper finally answers the billion-dollar question everyone with an interest in smartphone patents has been asking for some time: the total licensing cost per device. The authors have thoroughly researched the licensing environment and highlight various key facts that should give policymakers, regulators and courts pause. They note that royalty stacking, \"in which the cumulative demands of patent holders across the relevant technology or the device threaten to make it economically unviable to offer the product, [...] is not merely a theoretical concern\" (as, by the way, the likes of Qualcomm allege). Based on publicly-available data, these competent authors \"estimate potential patent royalties in excess of $120 on a hypothetical $400 smartphone--which is almost equal to the cost of [the] device's components\" (estimated to be $120 to $150 in total based on figures published by Nomura Securities in reliance on Gartner data). They conclude that \"those costs may be undermining industry profitability--and, in turn, diminishing incentives to invest and compete\". I also believe that smartphone-related patent licensing costs, relating to standard-essential as well as non-standard-essential patents, must come down. Policymakers, antitrust enforcers and judges -- Judge Posner certainly did his best in this regard -- will hopefully bring those fees down in the years ahead.\nThe paper does properly distinguish between royalty demands and actual royalty payments. Patent holders frequently have to lower their demands during the course of negotiation. Cross-licenses and \"patent exhaustion arising from licensed sales by component suppliers\" can also make a major difference, but the terms on which companies actually agree are usually kept confidential. Royalty demands sometimes surface in litigation.\nThe authors based their study entirely on public documents. They (especially the WilmerHale lawyers, who, among other things, defend Apple against Samsung's counterclaims) have obviously seen some confidential license agreements, but couldn't make use of any of that information for their working paper. They also don't speak for any particular company or firm. Apple just demanded a \"reasonable royalty\" of $40 per device from Samsung at the recent California trial, for five software patents. Now a paper authored in part by lawyers representing Apple against Samsung (with a defensive focus, but still) says that $120 per device for everyone's patents, -- hardware and software patents, standard-essential and non-standard-essential patents -- may be \"diminishing incentives to invest and compete\". This shows independent thinking and writing. I would not be surprised to see Samsung's lawyers quote certain key findings of this study in their U.S. litigations with Apple. The paper appears slightly Apple-friendly to me in the context of the design patents-related part of Apple v. Samsung, but within reason (I agree in principle with what it says about that). The study also notes that UI patents can typically be worked around, and \"[a] truly distinctive and innovative user interface--as distinct from a copied or derivative design--may result in minimal or no royalty exposure\".\nOne key characteristic of the study is that it analyzes licensing costs on a component-by-component (including software components) basis: cellular baseband chip, random access memory (different kinds), flash memory (different kinds), WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, battery, power management, audio (different subcategories such as MP3), camera/video (non-standards-based as well as standards-based formats like JPEG and H.264), applications processor, operating system, other pre-installed software, SMS, MMS, email, W3C (royalty-free standards), UPnP (royalty-free), digital media sharing, USB, user interface, outer design (also an area in which the study notes that infringement can be easily avoided).\nThe study has a much broader focus than my own litigation monitoring in recent years. Its findings appear plausible to me, except that I believe the \"operating system\" part of the royalty stack is underestimated. No operating system patent holder ever told me what their demands or actual deal terms were, but a couple of years ago I downloaded a litigation-related document that was publicly accessible for less than a day on the ITC document system that mentioned a major operating system patent holder's royalty demands. Against that background I think the study published today is very conservative (to say the least) with respect to operating system patent licensing costs -- but this, if anything, reinforces the overall message.\nThis is not a policy paper per se, but it does raise and stress policy concerns, particularly about non-practicing entities (NPEs), colloquially often referred to as \"patent trolls\", and the growing problem of \"privateering\" (patent transfers from major operating companies to NPEs in order to hide behind others that will assert patents aggressively against the original patent holder's competitors). Certain patent holders' demands, tactics and positions are discussed as examples of factors that exacerbate the royalty-stacking problem. Those patent holders include Ericsson and, to a far greater extent, Nokia, a company that has sold patents to a number of NPEs in recent years and is itself increasinly turning into a patent assertion entity.\nThis paper is recommended reading for everyone with an interest in smartphone IP issues from a legal and/or economic point of view. It's particularly recommended reading for all those who could, through their actions and decisions, address at least parts of the problem this paper describes. I believe it will be quoted a lot in court documents and academic writings in the years ahead.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Is there an etymological link between medicine and the Ancient Greek () meaning laugh or smile (as seen in Book 1 of the Iliad)? I hope this is the correct place to ask this. I wondered if there was a link due to the phrase 'laughter is the best medicine'. I also wondered if linked to the belief in Ancient Greece (eg, at Epidaurus Theatre) that laughter and theatre had an effect on well-being and health (there was a healing centre next to the theatre). I've looked briefly at various websites, most of whom mention the Latin origin, but I was interested in seeing whether there might be a different route anyone knew of.", "output": "No, there is no link. There are three main aspects to this, and all three of them agree fairly conclusively that there is precious little possibility that Greek has anything to do with medicine through the proverb 'laughter is the best medicine': there's the well-established Latin origin of the word medicine, the Greek verb itself, and the English proverb. The Latin origin As Josh's answer states, it is well-established that the word medicine comes to us through French from Latin, based ultimately on the verb medeor, which in Latin means only 'heal, cure, remedy, amend, correct, relieve'. Further back, that verb comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *med-, which originally meant 'measure, limit, consider, weight out, etc.'. Its meaning represents a semantic shift in that root which was specific to the Italic languages, however. The Greek cognates to the Latin verb (active and middle ), thus mean, respectively, 'protect, rule over' (representing a semantic shift specific to Greek) and 'provide for, think on, be mindful of, bethink one of'. Of the Latin verb, de Vaan says: The meaning of medeor is based on a semantic shift from 'measure' to 'distribute a cure, heal'. For a PIE stative verb (as assumed by LIV) or a frequentative, the e-grade in med- would be surprising. If the intermediate phase was 'to judge' (cf. meditor), medeor and its e-grade may have been grafted on the noun *medo(s)- 'judgement, law' (> modus) seen in U[mbrian] mers, mers 'law'. We can then regard it as a stative verb *med-e- 'to be a judge' > 'to be a healer, to heal' which was formed within Italic. The three essential things to note here are: that this sense of the base verb and its form were formed within the Italic branch of Indo-European languages; that the same root is attested in Greek with a different meaningand also a different form to the verb ; that the phonemic/phonetic form of the word 'medicine' in English, /md(i)sn/, is somewhat coincidental and bears no relation to its Latin forebearer. Medicus, the immediate ancestor, would be /medikus/ with a /k/ sound, like medical rather than medicine. The change from /k/ to /s/ did not happen until some time in Vulgar Latin, around a thousand years after the Iliad was en vogue. And of course the derivational base of Latin medicus is a verb that doesn't have any consonant there at all: the consonant is part of the adjectivising suffix, not the root. So the only thing left in common with the English word medicine is the stem med-. The Greek verb The verb form you're asking about here, , does not really mean 'laugh or smile' as such, but rather 'he/she/it smiled': it is the third person singular aorist form of the verb 'smile'. Moreover, it's an extended variant of that form: the base form is , without the ephelcystic nu, which gets rid of the n in medicine. Get rid of the further conditioning that this in an inflected aorist form (which very rarely form the basis for creating nouns), and you also lose the /s/, since that is the aorist marker. You then, again, have only a verbal root in common, this time meid-. Of course, that immediately raises the problem that meid- and med- are not the same thing: both English and Greek (and Latin, for that matter) have both, and they are not interchangeable. Greek words with -ei- do not normally end up yielding English // (that is, a short 'eh' sound). Even if that weren't enough to reject the theory, however, there is the fact that the Greek verb also has quite a satisfactory etymology: it is one of several extensions to the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)meih2-, whose base meaning is quite simply 'smile, be glad, laugh, be mirthful'. The extension that has survived in Greek here has a *-d-, while others have an *-r- or an *-l-. The reason the Greek verb begins with an m is quite simply that initial *sm- regularly loses its *s; the same happens with *sn-, which becomes just *n-.1 The same root is also behind the Latin adjective mirus (with the *-r- extension) and its derivatives (including words like miracle and admire): Latin underwent the same simplification of the initial cluster as Greek did. (The meaning of mirus 'wonderful, marvellous, amazing' represents another semantic shift that only happened within the Italic languages, or perhaps just within Latin itself.) In contrast, the Germanic languages were quite happy to keep *sm- unchanged, and the *smeih2- root also shows up as verbs here, indeed with both *-r- and *-l- extensions. The modern English forms of those verbs are smirk and smile. So with all that, the only part of medicine and that ends up being actually comparable is the m and the d. Not much, especially when you consider that both the proposed ancestors hereviz., Latin medeor and Greek have cognates in the opposite language that don't fit the form. The English proverb Finally, there is the question of the proverb that 'laughter is the best medicine'. While I don't think anyone knows for sure how old that particular turn of phrase is, it seems unlikely that it is as old as the Iliad. Proverbs 17:22 states that: A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. which is rather close to being the same sentiment. But it still seems fairly far-fetched as links goespecially when you consider that, as far as I can figure out, the classical Greek translation of that particular place used an entirely different word (my emphasis): , . The verb used for being cheerful here is 'cheer, make glad, be merry'; and the word loosely translatable as 'medicine' is , which literally means 'cause to be in a good condition'. So the Greek version really says,'A cheerful heart makes you in good condition', which is a fair distance from 'laughter is the best medicine'. Notes: If we're being precise, the initial s in this root is a so-called s-mobile, which means that even in Proto-Indo-European itself there seems to have been some vacillation between whether it was there or not. It showed up in some dialects/forms/cases/contexts, but not in others. That isn't particularly important in this case, though, since we're mostly dealing with two languages where it would have been lost anyway. There is at least some indirect evidence that both Greek and Latin did have the *s in this root originally: If it is correct that the word cosmis on the Duenos inscription is the same word, with the same meaning, as Classical Latin comis 'kind, gracious, affable, elegant', and that it represents an earlier *kom-smi- 'who has a smile', then the Early Latin form shows there was an original s there. If the Epic Greek form is an actual, historically justifiable form (rather than just a spurious variant to make it fit the metre by doubling the consonant), then it almost certainly represents *filo-hmeidas from earlier *filo-smeid-as, with the (in the compound not) initial *s.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

But the obvious and immediate targets appear to be nutritional supplements, health food stores, farmers’ markets and roadside food sales, small independent farmers in general and organic farmers in particular. I fear the law can and likely will be later extended to backyard gardeners for total control.\nThe bastards always sell the gullible public with an innocuous sounding “good idea” in a thumbnail sketch, then deliver a huge load of steaming manure laden with worms that infiltrate and consume our premises evermore.

{"input": "How to invite a girl to talk and hang out without her inviting a friend?\n\nI like her, she works in the office with me, and we've known each other for a month. I had already been hanging out with her and some friends. We have confidence, but I have not exposed my romantic intentions with her. I want  to go out with her to talk and drink some beers, after office, create an interaction of only her and me, and be able to take it to the romantic plane.\nOnce happened with a girl in a similar situation, where I invited her and she then took a male friend and I could not be alone with her.\nQuestion\nWhat is the best way that I can invite her without being explicit that I want to be only with her since my intentions are romantic?\nNotes and clarifications\n\nI don't want to be explicit (not showing that my intentions are romantic before going out). I think that it will create tension with her, and I don't want that.\n\nI don't want to represent the outing as a group event, I want to represent it like a relaxed talk with a colleague.\n\nI expect that she feels comfortable in the conversation, and then making little steps of closeness, turn in a romantic interaction plane. And see what happens, only then... If she refuses my intentions, I will accept the decision and move on.\n\nIn conclusion I want to \"make a move\", to transition the relationship.\n\nA:\n\nWhat is the best way that I can invite her without being explicitly that I want to be only with her?\n\nYou are asking how to invite someone out to be alone with them, without telling them that you want to be alone with them. There is no sure fire way to achieve this. If you invite them out without telling them that you would like it to be just the two of you, there is always a chance that they will invite others. It's possible that they may not invite anyone else, but you are just leaving it up to chance at that point. \n\nWhy do you want to avoid letting her know that you want to spend time with her one on one? – Meg\n@Meg Because I don't want to be explicitly that my intentions are romantic before go out. I think that it will create tension on her, and I don't want that.\n\nIt is much easier if you ask her on a date (or at least imply that you have romantic feelings) up front. If she feels the same way or is willing to see where things go, she will accept. If she doesn't have feelings for you and declines then you have your answer. Even if you get to a point where you two are out by yourselves, springing your feelings on her then is much more awkward for her. What is she supposed to do if she rejects you when it is just you two? Does she leave? Does she stay with someone she just rejected? Asking her on a date up front makes the out much easier for her if she declines.\n\nI'm unclear-- is your intention to spend time with her and then \"make a move\", to transition your relationship to a romantic one? Or to deepen your relationship one-on-one, and then try to transition to a romance later on? – Upper_Case\n@Upper_Case, I want the first one choice, \"make the move\" – Darwin\n\nYou said that you didn't want to create tension for her, but how much tension will there be if you go to \"make the move\" and she isn't interested? Just ask her out on a date up front and let her know what your honest intentions are, she will appreciate that much more.\n\nA:\n\nYou can ask her for a friendly (not high pressure or overtly romantic) social meeting by inviting her to participate in an activity with you.  By letting her know that you are inviting her specifically to do this activity, rather than that you are creating a group event that various people can/should attend, you can reduce the chance that she'll bring friends along.  Note that she still might try to bring someone if she is not comfortable spending time alone with you (or with men in general).\nSomething pretty simple like\n\nHey, do you want to check out the new brewery in town with me?  I was thinking of going Thursday night.\n\nKey here is to ask if SHE wants to do something, not \"Some of us were thinking of going to...\"  or \"I'm looking for somebody to go with me to...\", and then to keep the tone and the choice of events casual and not particularly romantic.", "output": "Let me see if I'm understanding the question correctly:\nYou want to give her the impression that this is a relaxed outing with a colleague, but your actual (hidden) intentions are romantic and you'll be looking for an opportunity to \"make a move\".\nIs that accurate?\nIf so, that sounds rather questionable at best, and downright creepy at worst.\nBe honest with her.  If you want a date, ask for a date.\nIf she's not interested, it will avoid any potential awkwardness if you try to make a move and it turns out that a relaxed talk with a colleague really was all that she wanted and it will also avoid wasting both your time and hers on a meetup where neither of you actually gets what you want (you, a date; her, a relaxed chat with a colleague).\nIf she is (at least potentially) interested, it will save you the nerves of wondering whether she shares your romantic intent or not and the effort of trying to figure that out, not to mention avoiding the need to find a way to deceive her about the intentions behind your invitation.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Tell me about the first Zeppelin raid of the summer.", "output": "Due to the long light evenings of summer, this was the first Zeppelin raid for three months. Of the ten Navy Zeppelins that set out, four turned back early. Thick sea fog and heavy coastal mist severely hampered the raid and only one, L.13, penetrated a significant distance inland.\nCommanded by Kapitänleutnant Eduard Prölss, L.13 came inland at North Somercoates on the Lincolnshire coast at 12.37am and embarked on a tour of the county with very little effect. Initially heading towards Lincoln, at 1.10am L.13 dropped a high-explosive (HE) and incendiary bomb on the village of Fiskerton, about six miles east of Lincoln, which broke windows in a house and a chapel. Prölss passed to the south of Lincoln and continued towards Newark, dropping an incendiary at Bassingham that landed harmlessly. Turning south, L.13 passed to the east of Newark, dropping a single incendiary bomb at Long Bennington before being attracted to the lights of a moving train on the line between Newark and Grantham. L.13 then dropped 27 bombs (10 x HE & 17 incendiary) which all fell between 50 and 500 yards of the railway. Two of the HE bombs fell at Stubton, breaking windows in a house, as did the four HE bombs that landed at Dry Doddington. Then, at about 2.00am, the remaining bombs all landed within 200 yards of Hougham station without causing any damage. L.13 then headed eastwards and went out to sea over the Wash, just north-east of Boston, at about 2.30am.\nZeppelin L.24, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Robert Koch, approached the mouth of the Humber at Kilnsea, crossed the estuary to Immingham, before dropping six HE bombs at 1.10am which landed on Stallingborough Marsh, near to Immingham Halt station. One of the bombs fell near the electric railway line, breaking electricity wires and windows in a hut. A 12-pdr gun at Immingham Halt hopefully fired off two rounds into the fog, but without result. L.24 exited on a north-east course across the Humber towards Withernsea where a 3-pdr and a 6pdr gun briefly engaged through the fog, each getting off a single round. For some reason Koch then steered north and came inland again briefly just south of Bridlington. He went towards Driffield but before he reached it he headed back to the coast at Hornsea, where he aimed two bombs at a Swedish merchant ship anchored off the town; both missed.\nKapitänleutnant Herbert Ehrlich, commanding L.17, appeared near Grimsby at the mouth of the Humber at about 12.10am. He headed north-west along the southern bank of the river in thick fog. A searchlight at Chase Hill Farm, North Killingholme, briefly opened up and L.17 responded by releasing eight HE and three or four incendiary bombs over Killingholme at about 12.45am; one fell on a road, the rest in fields. They caused no damage. Three minutes later he dropped another two HE and two incendiaries. These fell at East Halton. The two incendiaries set fire to a large straw stack on Manor Farm and an HE bomb exploded on a farm on Mill Lane where it killed a calf, damaged the farmhouse and demolished some outbuildings, while also causing minor damage to four cottages nearby. The other HE bomb landed in a field on Ash Tree Farm, damaging the windows of the farmhouse and those of two other cottages. Ehrlich then took L.17 back across the Humber and headed towards the coast, passing out to sea between Hornsea and Withernsea at about 1.10am.\nKapitänleutnant Erich Sommerfeldt, commanding L.16, approached the Norfolk coast at 12.50am but appears to have struggled with the fog. He came inland over Brancaster Bay, passed over Thornham and released a flare over Ringstead. At Hunstanton L.16 turned south towards Heacham, which she reached at 1.15am. She then probed south of the town, dropping two incendiary bombs over Snettisham before heading out over the Wash. She came back inland at Heacham, then returned to Brancaster Bay and headed out to sea at about 1.45am.\nKapitänleutnant Heinrich Mathy commanded L.31, one of the new ‘super Zeppelins’ as the British dubbed them, on her first flight to England. She came inland near Corton, just north of Lowestoft at about 1.15am. In the heavy fog Mathy first steered towards Beccles, then Bungay, but turned back to the east before reaching that town. He returned to the coast and, having circled there for a short time, went out to sea over Kessingland at about 1.50am. Unable to identify any targets, Mathy released no bombs overland.\nThe last raider to come inland, Korvettenkapitän Viktor Schutze’s L.11, approached Sheringham on the north Norfolk coast at 2.35am, dropping an HE bomb that landed in the sea. Five minutes later L.11 came inland at Weybourne, dropping an HE bomb in a field, killing a cow and dislodging roof tiles. Schutze released a flare over Holt and then, at 2.45am, dropped an HE bomb at Sharrington without damage. Another followed a few minutes later at Gunthorpe with a similar result. Turning eastwards, L.11 then headed back to the coast where she next dropped a HE bomb at Paston, near Mundesley at 3.20am (also, possibly an incendiary). Then, as she went out to sea over Mundesley, L.11 dropped a final HE and incendiary bomb. The incendiary landed about 300 yards from an AA gun positioned on Stow Hill.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you have any advice on how to cut chicken breast into strips successfully? Maybe a step-by-step guide with 12 steps?", "output": "1. The sharper the knife, the less chance you’ll have of injuring yourself because the knife won’t slide around as much. A longer knife will help you make smooth, clean cuts instead of having to make repeated cuts like a shorter knife would. A chef’s knife is also sturdy enough to cut through meat with just a little bit of pressure.\n\nAn easy way to sharpen a knife is with a knife sharpener. Press the knife blade into the side labeled as “coarse” and pull it towards you a couple of times, applying gentle pressure. Then pull it through the “fine” side.\n\nChef’s knives vary greatly in price based on quality and materials. Shop around at a kitchen store or an online retailer to pick one that you like and that’s comfortable to hold.\n2. Since raw chicken is very slippery, sitting it in the freezer before you cut it will help firm it up so it’s easier to handle. You don’t need to cover the breast and you can either leave it in the packaging or remove it first.\nIf you don’t want to wait for the chicken to get firm in the freezer, use a paper towel to pat the chicken dry before cutting. This won’t be as effective but will make the chicken a little less slippery.\n3. Remove the breast from the freezer and slide it off the plate onto the cutting board or use your hands to pick it up and set it down. It helps to place the breast towards the center of the cutting board. If it slides around at all, it will stay on the cutting board instead of slipping off onto the counter and potentially infecting it.\n\nIf you use your hands to pick up the chicken and move it to the cutting board, don’t touch anything besides the cutting board, chicken, or knife. Raw chicken can have bacteria which you don’t want to spread around the kitchen.\nUse a separate cutting board for chicken to avoid contaminating other food.\n4. Use the knife to trim around the ribs and breastbone, then pull the breast meat off the bone gently. Be sure to cut off the tendon at the bottom, too.\nCut as close to the bone as you can without removing too much flesh from the chicken breasts.\n5. Use whichever hand you won’t be cutting with. Rest your palm firmly on the piece of chicken and curl your fingers slightly under your knuckles. This protects them from getting cut by the knife as you slice.\nFor people who are prone to injury or don’t trust themselves with a super sharp knife, buy a pair of cut-resistant gloves online or at a kitchen store. They’re made from the same material as bulletproof vests and will keep your hands cut-free.\n6. Find the grain (the tiny white muscle fibers) and cut across it, instead of parallel to it. If the grain runs up and down, cut left to right. Make a long stroke with your knife, dragging it through the breast in one clean slice.\nCutting against the grain makes your chicken more tender once it’s cooked.\n7. Make your strips as thin or as thick as you’d like, but keep them all equal size so that they cook evenly. Depending on the width of your strips, 1 chicken breast can yield anywhere from 5 to 7 strips.\nDetermine how wide you want your strips based on what you're using them for. Fajitas, for example, use thinner strips that are about ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) wide whereas fried chicken strips should be cut 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide.\n8. Kitchen scissors are different from regular scissors in that they’re sharper and sturdier so they can cut through everything from meat to bone. Look for a pair that’s detachable (they may also be labeled as “2-piece”). With this type of scissor, you’re able to take the 2 halves apart to clean between the blades.\nMost kitchen shears cost between $10 and $20. Purchase them at a kitchen store or from an online retailer.\n9. Even though you can hold your chicken breast in the air while you cut it, that’s not recommended. Putting it on a cutting board gives you more control over the breast and helps you make straighter cuts.\nAnother option is to cut the chicken in the pan that you’ll be cooking it in. Since you are using scissors instead of a knife, you don’t have to worry about cutting into the pan and it makes for one less dish to clean up!\n10. Make small cuts around the ribs and breastbone while using your fingers to pull the meat away from the bone. Then cut off the white tendon.\nIt might be easier to use a boning knife for this. Feel along the underside of the chicken breast as you're cutting, follow the bone, and make sure you cut away all the bones.\n11. The grain is the small white muscle fibers running through the chicken breast. You'll cut in the opposite direction, so you're intersecting the grain instead of cutting along with it.\nCutting with the grain makes chicken chewier and tougher.\n12. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the chicken in place on the cutting board while you use the other hand to cut through the breast with the shears. Lightly graze the cutting board as you cut to guide the shears through the meat in a straight line.\nDepending on how large the breast is, you’ll likely need to make multiple cuts per strip. If the breast is really thick, make small cuts to get all the way through the breast instead of trying to do it all in one cut.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The payment platform has around 5 million users. Now, the five million users can now ditch their traditional fiat and use XRP for payment. According to the report, it has already made its debut on the Android app of the company.\nThe platform which launched in 2014 allows its users in Philippines to pay their bills in cryptocurrency directly. The platform hopes that it will soon build its customer base to 20 million by 2020. Reportedly, the platform also offers Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. Coins.ph head of cryptocurrencies, Colin Goltra, told Bitpinas in an interview previously that they were testing a XRP integration in its wallet app. They rolled out XRP integration to some of the randomly selected participants.\nThe community has a reason to rejoice since this comes as big news as far as the crypto’s adoption is concerned. Not just because of this but also because holders collectively transferred XRP worth millions of dollars and started spending on everyday items after payment with Wirex Visa card became available.\nCurrently, the crypto is meeting the basic crypto demands in terms of speed, security and control. In fact, transactions can be settled in seconds. With Wirex things have become even easier. Wirex allows users to interact between fiat and cryptocurrencies through a secure 3D debit card.\nMoreover, one can link their Wirex XRP wallet to the debit or credit card, making it all the more easy. If the user is within the Europe Economic Area (EEA) and have a verified account, the person might enjoy a number of other benefits.

{"input": "What is the most efficient way to enjoy solitude? Could you provide a list of 15 steps?", "output": "1. See the benefit of solitude.: Many people equate solitude with loneliness. They are not the same. Loneliness is subjected to you by other people. It can make you feel sad or miserable. Solitude, on the other hand, can be a time of rejuvenation and exploring the self. Here are just a few benefits of spending time alone:\n\nYour brain has a break to rest and reboot.\nYou are more capable of being productive.\nYou learn more about yourself during moments of solitude.\nYou have a better opportunity to problem-solve and weigh your options.\nYou have an improved perception of yourself and therefore choose more healthy relationships.\n2. Increase the amount of time you spend alone gradually.: Take baby steps. If you are a person who tends to think solitude is boring or uncomfortable, it may not do well to force yourself into long bouts of solitude. In this case, it's better to slowly increase the amount of time you spend alone.\n\nIf you are always surrounded by others, simply schedule in about 30 minutes of solitude each day for a week. You might choose to drive or walk to work on your own instead of joining someone else. You might go for a hike alone or visit the beach on your own. Just commit to doing a short, 30-minute activity without anyone else present or demanding your attention.\nTake notes on the experience. Was it better than you anticipated? Were you bored? Why? Write down as many details as possible to better understand your aversion to being alone.\n3. Prepare wisely for moments of solitude.: Just because you find solitude boring doesn't mean it has to be. If you have periods of alone time approaching, make plans so that your solitude is filled with interesting and fulfilling activities. \n\nFor example, if you have to stay home on your own for a weekend, you could rent some cool movies, plan to do a creative project, or complete schoolwork during your alone time. To keep your energy revved, gather fun music, books, and other tools to make the time less boring.\nPreparing for moments of solitude can make the difference between the time dragging by and going by more quickly. Simply fill the hours with things you already love to do.\n4. Develop a passion for art.: Because creativity flourishes during moments of solitude, you may benefit from selectively choosing periods to boost this aspect of yourself. When you are not distracted by the demands of others on your time, your mind opens up to greater possibilities.\nBeing alone is a great time to brainstorm a new business idea, write a novel, develop a new song, make pottery, improve your photography skills, and so on. Even if you do not work in an obvious creative field, you can still benefit from this creativity boost.\n5. Engage in a hobby.: Although you can pursue passions and interests with others, you can also have fun pursuing them alone. Whatever it is that makes you feel relaxed and happy, do it by yourself. This brings with it the added value of allowing you to relax and de-stress on your own. You can also do things that maybe your friends or partner are not interested in or do not have time to join in on.\nSolo activities cover the full spectrum of hobbies. You can go for a hike, read a book, visit a museum, or shop at a flea market.\n6. Play with a furry friend.: Just because you’re not spending time with any humans doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy time with an animal companion. Caring for pets can help you overcome a multitude of ills, such as loneliness, depression or anxiety. Pets influence us to go outdoors, they provide companionship without requiring conversation, and they help us make healthier decisions.\n7. Perform self-care activities.: Alone time is a perfect opportunity to do activities that are nurturing and soothing to your mind, body, and soul. Many people neglect self-care because they are so busy with other obligations. However, tending to your mental and emotional well-being can allow you to perform better, concentrate better, and even fight stress in your daily life--no matter what your career involves.\n\nSelf-care activities can be anything you enjoy doing that restores you. It could be meditating in the mornings before starting your daily routine. It could be relaxing in a hot bath after a long day of work.\nChoose a few activities that you find soothing and do them during your alone time each week. You might find, after doing this for a few days/weeks, that you have actually come to like solitude!\n8. Be grateful for the life you have.: A great way to use your solitude constructively is to start a gratitude journal. Being grateful allows you to appreciate what you already have instead of fretting over what you don’t. Gratitude promotes positive thinking and can even lift your mood.\nSpend a few minutes of your solitude jotting down a couple of things/people/opportunities you have to be thankful for. They can be a simple as having a bed to sleep in or a moment to yourself.\n9. Set realistic goals and develop a plan to accomplish them.: Your alone time can be a perfect opportunity to reflect on your personal development. Use this time to consider your personal or career goals and how far along you are in reaching them. If you don’t have any concrete goals, now’s the time to spell them out and create an action plan.\n\nSince solitude boosts concentration and productivity, this a wonderful time to plan out your goals and figure out a method for reaching them. Just be sure to develop SMART goals. These are goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-dependent.\n\nGet a notebook and jot down some major goals and add in actions you can take to accomplish them. If you have really large goals, you may need to create smaller goals to move towards before reaching the primary one. For example, if you would like to move to Spain, you might have smaller goals like saving money, finding a job, and learning Spanish.\n10. Journal about your thoughts and behaviors.: Journaling is a great tool for self-reflection. Taking some of your alone time to write down how your day went can help you unload stress, spot patterns in your thoughts and behaviors, and come up with solutions to problems. As a result, you will have enhanced your mental health and well-being and feel more confident about going through hardships.\n11. Carry out spiritual practices.: Solitude can also help you develop your own sense of spirituality. Whether that translates to following religious principles or discovering your true purpose in life, you will have the ability to think more clearly and deeply when alone.\nSpirituality will mean different things to different people, but it tends to refer to a connectedness with one’s inner self—a process that can only be achieved when alone. Use this time to meditate, practice yoga, pray, or reflect in nature for great spiritual understanding.\n12. Exercise in your free time.: Regular physical activity is important for good health and longevity. Plus, engaging in exercise releases “feel-good” chemicals into the brain called endorphins, helping to lift your mood and clear your thinking. If you have a moment of alone time to spare, get your body moving.\nIn addition to boosting your mood, exercise also enhances energy, fights disease, improves sleep quality, and helps you manage weight. Go for a walk/run with your dog. Hike through the local woods. Ride your bike to the farmer’s market on weekends.\n13. Take a nap.: Sometimes, you may be so over-engaged with those around you that you do not allow yourself time to properly rest. Napping too late in the day can interfere with your nighttime rest, but as long as you time it right, your nap can provide much needed energy and restoration.\nJust keep your naps to a short period of time (say, 20-30 minutes) and several hours before you were planning to go to bed at night.\n14. Complete chores and errands.: When you’re not surrounded by family or friends, you may get a special opportunity to catch up on chores that need completing. If you are faced with long bouts of solitude, make a list of projects you have wanted to get done, and start moving through the list. This will make your periods of solitude productive and also help the time go by faster.\n15. Do nothing.: Truth is, some people schedule activities and events for nearly every second of every day. This pursuit of “busyness” can make it seem as if you are being productive when, in reality, you are not. Some people believe downtime is a sign of weakness or not trying hard enough, so they aim to stay busy.\n\nBe mindful that downtime can be incredibly positive when it is used for self-soothing and restoring activities. However, if you are using your downtime for mindless activities or distractions, you could be adding to your stress rather than relieving it.\nAssess the things you do during alone time and see if they have a positive benefit or are simply distractions until you are around others again.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

And with former Press Secretary Sean Spicer's resignation announced just hours after, Scaramucci, new to the field, will have his work cut out for him. Especially since he and the president apparently disagree on so many of the policies Scaramucci will have to sell to the public.\nEarlier today, writer Josh Billinson was one of the first to spot two old Scaramucci tweets that bashed Trump directly, which Scaramucci then promptly deleted. Of course, this won’t be the first time Trump’s hired someone with dissenting beliefs. His chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, is a registered Democrat, and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had previously bashed Trump for constantly whining about a rigged election.\nThese people have mostly taken on advisory roles, though. Scaramucci will be a mouthpiece. And while he's largely supported Trump, he hasn't supported many of Trump's current policies.\nSo as a way to welcome our new White House communications director, let's take a look at where he stands on some of the policies he'll be shilling for starting today.\nUpdate 7/22: Scaramucci has begun deleting his old tweets, writing on Twitter, \"Full transparency: I'm deleting old tweets. Past views evolved & shouldn't be a distraction. I serve @POTUS agenda & that's all that matters.\" We'll be replacing his deleted tweets with screenshots as necessary.\nHe has also said, \"The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway … A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state,\" as well as \"Fact—the tighter the gun laws, the more violence. The criminals will always have guns.\"\nTrump says: After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, Trump went on television and announced that he would \"strongly consider\" closing all mosques in the US, saying, \"I would hate to do it, but it's something that you're going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas.\"\nLast year, when asked whether he believed that the First Amendment gave the press \"too much protection,\" Donald Trump said yes: \"Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And I think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong ... then yes, I think you should have the ability to sue them.\"\nSpeaking in Pennsylvania last June, Trump said, \"Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy ... but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\" He also touched on the subject in his inauguration speech: \"We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\"\nTrump has had a quite a bit to say about Hillary Clinton, including that she \"should have been prosecuted and should be in jail,\" is \"incompetent,\" has \"bad judgement,\" \"doesn't have the drive or stamina,\" and \"was so insulting.\"\nTrump says: In April, Trump lobbied for his wall to supporters yet again, noting, \"We need safety. We need cameras, we need all of the things that we are going to be putting in, and we need the wall. And we will build the wall as sure as you are standing there tonight. We need the wall.\" Less than a month later, at a joint press conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said once again that \"walls work. Just ask Israel.\"\nOne of the only things Trump has ever managed to be consistent on his opinion of Russian leadership, of which he has said, \"I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. We need real leadership, and fast, before it is too late\" and \"Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD.\"\nJeb Bush was one of Trump's very favorite targets during the campaign, which saw him saying things like \"Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!\" and \"Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!\"\nAnyways, best of luck to Mooch and his eventual team of lawyers.

{"input": "What are the potential causes for a series of recent US naval collisions, according to Admiral James \"Ace\" Lyons?", "output": "In an interview with the Center for Security Policy’s Frank Gaffney yesterday, retired Navy Admiral James “Ace” Lyons, who is a frequent guest on Gaffney’s radio program, linked a recent string of U.S. naval collisions to Obama administration efforts to allow LGBT people to serve openly in the military and to open up more positions in the military to women, suggesting that the person responsible for one collision might have been a member of one of these “social engineering” groups.\nGaffney asked Lyons to discuss the possibility that the Fitzgerald collision was the result of “a deliberate incident” that was “perhaps contributed to by some of the considerations that you’ve just talked about,” before telling Lyons that he had heard from unnamed military personnel that an Obama-era emphasis on “diversity training” meant that the service members in charge of these ships were unqualified.\n“I’ve had more than one senior military officer tell me that they suspected that all of these personnel were highly rated in terms of their diversity training and equal-opportunity sensitivity and all of that, but may not have gotten their chops checked out in terms of navigation and seamanship,” Gaffney said.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Summarize the impacts of the UK government's decision to not fund projects before 2025 on energy bills and the environment.", "output": "The Treasury said it had taken the decision to “protect” consumers, because households and businesses were facing an annual cost of about £9bn on their energy bills to pay for wind, solar and nuclear subsidies to which it had already committed.\nThe revelation that there will be no more money for projects before 2025 could dash hopes for pioneering projects such as the proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea, which has a mooted launch date of 2022.\nEnvironmental groups criticised the Treasury move. The WWF said it was a huge disappointment, while Greenpeace claimed Wednesday’s budget was one of the least green ever.\nBusiness groups also reacted with dismay. The pro-environment Aldersgate Group, whose members include BT, Ikea and Marks & Spencer, said the lack of clarity on low-carbon power investments was disappointing.\nIt is understood the policy will only affect projects generating electricity before 2025, so would not stop firms signing contracts for power stations coming online after 2025. That means the backers of new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be affected by the decision, because none was expected to be built by then. But it could be a blow for the companies wanting to build solar farms, onshore windfarms and other clean power plants at an earlier date.\nSome industry figures took comfort from Treasury language suggesting that some contracts might be allowed for renewables if the price were so low as to be effectively subsidy-free.\nThe government confirmed that it would honour an existing pledge to auction £557m of renewable energy subsidies, beginning next year. But most of that pot is expected to be taken by giant offshore windfarms, likely crowding out other technologies such as tidal.\nThe government also announced that until 2025 it was freezing a carbon tax on dirty energy generators. Big energy firms, including SSE, have been calling for the tax, the carbon price floor, to be strengthened to encourage new investment in greener energy.\nRecent research by energy analysts suggested that without an increase in the tax, coal power plant owners would enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s before they hit a government deadline for the closure of all coal-fired stations by 2025.\nOne expert said the decision to freeze rather than increase the tax meant the UK’s climate change target for 2030 was being put at risk.\n“It is disappointing that the Treasury is continuing its indefinite freeze of the carbon price support rate, a move that could endanger the achievement of the UK’s emissions target for 2030,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\nHe added that the current price of around £24.50 a tonne of CO2 was likely to be too weak to drive the energy market to shift from gas power stations to renewables and nuclear.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What is a directed energy weapon (DEW)?", "output": "India has successfully tested a 1KW laser weaponry system, according to a report published in the Economic Times. The test was carried out by India’s Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) in August this year at Chitradurga in Karnataka state.\nAn official told the Economic Times that the 1KW laser system was installed on a truck, and the beam produced by the weapon system precisely hit a metal sheet located 250 meters away from it. The beam created a hole in the sheet and took just 36 seconds to accomplish this task. Indian defense minister Arun Jaitley was also present at the site, where these tests were conducted.\nDRDO is India’s main defense research agency responsible for developing advanced weaponry systems for the country and making India self-reliant in terms of defense systems. The agency was created in 1958. It is headquartered in New Delhi, India, and is currently working in a variety of areas of military technology, including missiles, combat vehicles, aeronautics, instrumentation, armaments, electronics, naval systems, etc., to develop advanced, powerful weapons for the country.\nFor the past many years, DRDO has been trying to produce directed energy weapons (DEWs), although not much was revealed by the agency about this program. The Economic Times report reveals that DRDO’s two laboratories LASTEC and CHESS have been given the responsibility to develop the “heart of the system”—the laser beam source—which is currently purchased from Germany. Some private players, including Kalyani Group, are also trying to develop DEWs in India.\nDEWs are based on high-powered lasers. They produce a powerful beam of electromagnetic energy, which can destroy aircraft, ships, missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and different types of weapons in the battlefield within seconds. At the time of a war, DEWs can be used to kill enemy soldiers by burning specific areas of their bodies or by making them blind.\nAccording to defense experts, researchers are currently working on two types of DEWs: microwaves and high-powered lasers. While it is not clear whether DRDO has any plan to develop microwave weapons, the agency is definitely planning to develop more powerful laser systems able to hit targets from longer distances.\nThe Economic Times report also reveals that DRDO will now test a 2KW laser system against a target located 1 km away from the test weapon.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Give me 20 steps to look ulzzang.", "output": "You might have seen people on Instagram or TikTok with large, doll-like eyes, glossy, gradated pink lips, and soft, dewy skin. This popular aesthetic has roots in Korean skincare and fashion and is known as \"ulzzang,\" which is Korean for \"best face\"—and no wonder! If you're wondering how you can achieve this look yourself, look no further: we’ve created a guide to adopting this trendy aesthetic to help you achieve your own perfectly Instagrammable ulzzang look.\n1. The ulzzang look is all about accentuating your natural beauty, and that means keeping your skin adequately moisturized and hydrated. Start and end your day by using a quality moisturizer, and apply a quick spritz of facial mist as needed throughout the day to keep your face looking dewy and clean.\n\nIf you have dry skin, try sleeping in a leave-on night mask cream.\nConsider buying a facial mist to carry in your bag or leave at your desk to use throughout the day. Not only will regular facial misting make your skin look fresh, it will help you feel fresh and energized as well.\n2. Primer is a Korean skincare staple. Rub a pea-sized amount of primer into your face prior to applying any other products; this will make your face a more even \"canvas\" on which to apply the rest of your makeup.\nIt doesn't take much primer to be effective. In fact, applying too much primer can cause the primer to stick to itself rather than your face and leave your skin looking a bit cakey.\n3. Ulzzang makeup should make your skin look soft and smooth, but stick with nude or other natural-colored makeup. Use concealer, foundation, or BB cream to cover up blemishes, including acne or blackheads, but feel free to take a minimalist approach to your coverup if you don't want to conceal freckles or beauty marks.\nAccentuate your cheekbones with highlighter, and add a bit of blush to your cheeks and the tip of your nose. Opt for natural shades, like peach or light rose.\n4. Try white or beige eye shadow to ensure your makeup will go with most outfits. Opt for skin tones rather than more colorful or flashy hues.\nWhile the ulzzang aesthetic is about looking effortlessly natural, if you do want to add a bit of pizzazz to your look, glam up with some shimmery eyeshadow—just keep the color in the champagne or pink family!\n5. A little makeup can go a long way in making your eyes appear bigger. Apply a thin line of black or dark-colored eyeliner to your top lid to make your eyes seem larger. Avoid applying black to your lower lid, though, as this may end up making your eyes appear smaller.\n\nWhile black eyeliner will make your eyes look bigger, you can also apply white eyeliner to your eyes to make them pop.\n\nApplying a nude- or white-colored eyeliner along the inside of your lower lashes can make your eyes look wider and bigger than they actually are.\n6. You may also apply false eyelashes if you want to, but make sure your eyelashes aren't thick. Ulzzang is notable for its use of natural-looking skin tones in the makeup, so you don't want the fake lashes to look heavy or clumpy.\nIf you have straight lashes, try using an eyelash curler to give them a curve.\n7. For ulzzang lips, select natural color tones that will highlight and plump your lips without changing their color dramatically. Pick 2 shades from the same color family, and apply the darker lipstick first, making sure to totally color your lips. Then apply a lighter, brighter shade of lipstick only to the middle of your lips. Use your finger to blend the lighter shade outward to give your lips a gradient appearance.\nGlossy skin tones are perfect for cultivating the ulzzang look. The goal of ulzzang is to highlight and emphasize your own natural beauty, making it look effortless and simple.\n8. You don't have to have naturally large eyes to give the illusion of ulzzang beauty. Circle lenses give off the illusion of large eyes, even if you have smaller eyes.\nSee an ophthalmologist and ask your parents before wearing cosmetic lenses. They're not right for all eye-types, especially if you have astigmatism or other shape-issues with your eyes.\n9. Generally, ulzzang style is notable for the use of skinny jeans of all colors, worn by both boys and girls. Pastels and natural-looking colors are common, as with ulzzang makeup, but you can also try flashier colors if you want.\nFind the right fit and then get a variety of colors of a style that you like and that looks good on your body.\n10. T-shirts featuring unusual artistic prints, often off-center on the shirt, are quite popular. These types of shirts are widely available at clothing stores like Macy's, Kohl's, Walmart, and even Target.\n\nAvoid overt brand stamps on shirts and choose shirts that feature cartoon characters or other artistic designs. Many popular shirt styles look as if they've been hand-made, screen printed and one-of-a-kind, with clever jokes or visual puns.\nMixing proportions is essential to ulzzang couture: pair an oversized T with your skinny jeans or a mini skirt, or match a crop top with a maxi skirt.\n11. The combination of tight-fitting jeans with loose sweaters is a marker of the ulzzang style. V-necks are popular, as well as regular-fit sweaters in bright colors or featuring prints of the same variety as ulzzang-style t-shirts.\nOversized clothing is a staple of ulzzang! Being flashy or trendy is less important to the ulzzang aesthetic than being comfy and looking adorable and cozy.\n12. Ulzzang fashion demands adorable, chic jewelry and other accessories—but nothing too flashy. Opt for modern, angular designs, and stick to neutrals and natural colors, like gold, white, or beige.\nUlzzang accessories range from jewelry to watches to scarves and hats. There are a number of ways to accessorize to match your personal style and still be ulzzang!\n13. One unique aspect of online ulzzang culture is that it often revolves around photographs that feature the style of a cute-looking couple, usually wearing some kind of couple's outfit that matches in some kind of theme.\nWear matching colors or complimentary colors, rather than wearing identical outfits. Often ulzzang style clothes are sold in couple packs. Wearing \"I love my partner\" t-shirts together, or wearing corresponding heart necklaces is common among ulzzang photos.\n14. Generally, the ulzzang haircut is similar for boys or girls, featuring layers of hair and bangs. Some highlights are also common, but they shouldn't be severe or particularly dramatic. Natural hair color is more desirable than, say, blue anime-style highlights.\n\nBoys typically have a medium-length cut with side-swept bangs, longer somewhat in the front than in the back.\nGirls often have straight bangs or side-swept bangs with either straight or loosely curled hair. Generally, the hair is dark brown or chestnut-colored, as opposed to blonde.\n15. Beyond getting the ulzzang bangs, the “right” haircut isn’t universal. Talk to your hairstylist and pick a style that will flatter your unique beauty and features, emphasizing your jawline and the shape of your face. It's less important to get a particular haircut than to get one that looks good on you.\n16. Ulzzang styled hair is generally very healthy-looking and shimmering, highlighting the natural beauty of your coloring. Use fortifying shampoo and conditioner, as well as regular brushing to keep your hair healthy.\n\nBe careful of using too much heat on your hair, which can fry it some and leave it frazzled looking and damaged. Let the natural oils in your hair do their work.\nDo your hair in cute styles. Ulzzang hair is all about looking natural and adorable. Curl your hair for a bit of a wave and dress it up with small bows or clips, but don’t go overboard.\n17. Instagram and TikTok are huge social media sites for ulzzangs. Regularly posting ulzzang selfies to these apps, utilizing ulzzang hashtags, and following social media trends will boost your popularity in no time.\n\nGain more traction on the internet by using ulzzang hashtags like #ulzzang, #ulzzangstyle, #ulzzanggirl, and more.\nFollow other ulzzangs to develop your online community.\nMany ulzzangs gain internet fame by posting regularly and becoming social media influencers, but this is totally optional. You can be ulzzang and never use social media at all if you prefer not to!\n18. Cultivating an online presence that includes lots of cute-looking self portraits is an important part of ulzzang culture. Snap pictures of yourself out doing fun things, or shake up a dull evening at home by getting dressed up and having a photo shoot.\nPlan cute photo shoots with your partner when you're out on a date. Use clothing catalogs and fashion magazines for inspiration. The social networking presence of the ulzzang looks like it was pulled straight from an Eddie Bauer catalog.\n19. Though ulzzang means \"best face\" in Korean, ulzzangs don't actually look \"perfect\": they just know how to dress well and utilize technology to make their pictures look as attractive as possible. Get a good-quality cellphone with a camera and the right apps to make your pictures as sharp as you can.\n\n\nPicLab HD only costs $1.99 and allows you to customize your filters and add text. It's a professional-looking way of taking ulzzang photos. HandyPhoto is also a good cheap option offering similar features.\n\nFacetune is a mobile photo-editing app that allows you to fix up blemishes and adjust coloring in your photos. Many ulzzang photos are heavily edited, so you might consider getting this if you don't have Photoshop.\n20. Soompi, a K-Pop and South Korean culture site, has a regular Ulzzang contest featuring a prestigious package for the winners, including an audition and interview with major South Korean fashion magazines. Many more informal contests are also available on Facebook and other social networking sites.\nMany K-Pop stars got started by cultivating an online ulzzang presence and entering these kinds of contests.
