Judge walked to begin the Yankees' half of the frame, and later took off with Gary Sanchez at the dish. Judge went in standing, and even rounded the base as he tracked Sanchez's batted ball. Alas, right fielder Josh Reddick made a nice catch, prompting Judge to retreat.\nJudge was originally called out at first base, but a review corrected the call, as he'd slid in before a tag was applied. So, Judge was safe at first -- there was just one problem though: he hadn't touched second base on his way back to first. The Astros and the Yankees knew it, too, and Judge scrambled toward second before being caught stealing while the Astros were in the process of appealing.\nWait, what? @Ken_Rosenthal explains the 4th inning Aaron-Judge-on-the-bases madness.\nWhy did Judge run? Because Joe Girardi told him to because he knew he was going to be called out, meaning his one chance at being deemed safe was reaching the bag before the Astros could appeal and/or tag him out.

{"input": "Should there be separate PMs for projects which involve development of new hardware and new software?\n\nMy company is developing a new product which consists of several embedded systems.  The hardware for these devices is being developed by electrical and mechanical engineers and the software is being developed by software engineers.  Of course the hardware guys and the software guys work together as necessary, but since the devices are running embedded Linux, the hardware/software concerns are pretty well separated and the different engineers are able to work separately and in parallel for the most part, independent of each others' progress.\nThis project has a single PM with a hardware background, and he has been mostly focusing on the hardware aspect of things while the software side has not received much managerial attention and has fallen behind schedule.  I, as a software engineer on the project, have often wished we had a software project manager assigned to the project to manage things better on our end.  I have tried to fill in as an unofficial software PM as much as I can without stepping on any toes, but I just don't have enough pull to be effective in this effort.\nSo my question is, do projects of this nature generally have a software PM and a hardware PM assigned?  I would like to suggest a possible new approach for our next project, and I'd like to know what has worked for other people in this situation.\nEDIT - More details from comments below.\nHalf the software is being developed in-house and the other half is being done by a contractor.\nWe have regularly-scheduled hardware reviews and all of our meetings with the contractor consist of 95% hardware talk. We have no idea what the status of the software being developed by the contractor is, other than they are \"working on it\" and it's \"coming along\". I seem to be the only one that is concerned that we have no real idea of the status of the software after 1 year of work so far. I have tried to convince the PM that we need more visibility into the software status, but he doesn't seem concerned, even after hearing my suspicions that the contractor is way behind schedule on the software side.\nI feel that if we had a Software PM, we would have a much better handle on the software status and we wouldn't be at such risk of schedule/cost overruns.\n\nA:\n\nThis is about span of control.  And there are rules of thumb to help an organization decide when it is time to put in a layer of control.  Of course, there are competing and contradicting schools of thought on this.  You need to research the benefits, costs, and risks of different approaches to see what fits best in your organization for this project at this time.  \nYou will likely find rules that say at about six to eight reports you need a layer and other rules that say you can go as high as 20 reports before adding a layer.  A lot of this thinking is economically driven rather than validity of the thought.  You have to sift through that.\nIf on your team it proves adding a layer adds more expense than benefit, the attention paid to the other team might be out of necessity, e.g., that team is struggling and that degree of attention is warranted, no matter the struggles your team is having...at least up until your struggles exceed the other team's.  That just has to happen because no project is ever perfect and you have to pick your battles.\nAnother aspect to look at is the natural evolution of team roles that develop.  Throw five or six people at a task and you will see, over time as the team matures, the individuals gravitating to various team roles, including a lead role.  I'd be surprised if this is not happening on your team, though it may not be if your team is imploding.  If it is happening, exploit and enhance it.  The one who is sort of taking ownership as the lead needs to continue in that evolution, which means (s)he needs to begin overseeing not only the task but also the management and control of it, including costs, schedule, risks, and other leadership things.  If this happens to be you, run with it.\nEDIT to follow additional information:  After reading your additional comments, it appears the issue is not a lack of SW PM, it is a lack of PM controls and methods.  It is typical to throw a person at a problem the same way we blame a person when things go south.  A more sophisticated analysis will likely show other capability enabling issues, such as weak and out-of-control processes, weak tools that lack integration, weak organization intellectual capital...and certainly it can also be due to weak people performance.  \nThe piece of work farmed out needed to have other deliverables as part of that contract, things like a schedule, reports on a set frequency, intermediate verification and validation of scope and milestones, things like this.  Flying blind to the end date is using hope for strategy.  \nSo certainly your current PM has some blame for not enforcing or causing these controls to oversee your farmed out work; however, you may have bigger issues with your organization and its current maturation level around project management methods.  \n\nA:\n\nI think there are two problems here.  I cannot improve on David Espina's description of the Span of Control problem; the second problem has to do with accountability.  The PM is focusing on the areas where his technical skills are most applicable and failing to exert effective project management over the project.   I think the H/W vs S/W issue is a distraction; the core issue is that the PM is failing to exercise effective oversight over cost/scope/schedule.\nYou propose insertion of a  S/W PM as a solution.  I don't have all the information that you do, but my preferred intervention would be to assess the impact of the problem.  For political reasons, you'd probably have to brief the PM first.  I would avoid discussion of HW vs S/W. I would focus on:\n\nThe tasks/WBS lines that are delayed\nThe impact of the delay on the project's scope/schedule/cost/quality/fitness for use/enterprise objectives\nThe root cause(s) of the delay\nOne or more solutions to the root cause(s)\nHow to measure whether the solutions are working (if they aren't, it may be necessary to brief stakeholders about the risk of project failure. \n\nThat would be my advice, and I guarantee that it is worth at least what you paid for it.

You should be the change agent. Meet with the stakeholders/project sponsors, understand their goals and build a high-level baseline plan on what milestones/deliverables the project should be hitting at what times and how much that should cost at each milestone.

{"input": "What can you tell me about DNA mutations?", "output": "If you had to copy billions of letters from one sheet of paper to another, you'd probably make a few mistakes. So it might not come as a surprise that when DNA makes a copy of its three-billion-base genetic code, it can slip up too.\nThe human's excuse could be fatigue or boredom, but scientists have long wondered how DNA's nearly infallible replication machinery makes the mistakes that it does. Now, they think they may know a big part of the answer.\nScientists have discovered that the helical structure of DNA contains a kind of built-in timer that determines the frequency at which specific mutations spontaneously occur. They show that certain DNA bases can shape-shift for a thousandth of a second, transiently morphing into alternative states that can allow the replication machinery to incorporate the wrong base pairs into its double helix. Such mismatches, though rare, could serve as the basis of genetic changes that drive evolution and diseases, including cancer.\n\"Increasing or decreasing the rates of spontaneous mutations could significantly alter the ability of an organism to evolve or alter its susceptibility to disease,\" said Hashim M. Al-Hashimi, Ph.D., senior author of the study and James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry and Chemistry at the Duke University School of Medicine.\"An interesting question is: What determines the mutation rate in a living organism,\" Al-Hashimi said. \"From there, we can begin to understand the specific conditions or environmental stressors that can elevate errors.\"\nThe findings are published Feb. 1 in the journal Nature.\nEvery time our cells divide, the DNA within them must replicate so that each new cell receives the same set of instructions. Molecular machines known as polymerases make these copies of DNA by recognizing the shape of the right base pair combinations—G with C and A with T—and adding them into each new double helix, while discarding those that don't fit together correctly. Though they are good at their job, polymerases are known to slip up from time to time, generating a mistake roughly one out of every 10,000 bases. If not fixed these become immortalized in the genome as a mutation.\nIn their landmark 1953 paper describing the iconic structure of the DNA double helix, Watson and Crick hypothesized that DNA bases might be able to change their shape so that mispairs could pass as the real thing. A few years ago, Al-Hashimi and his colleagues used a sophisticated technique called NMR relaxation dispersion to capture these tiny movements or \"quantum jitters,\" which only last for the blink of an eye.\nThe study, published in a 2015 issue of Nature, showed the bases G and T nudging aside the atoms on their surface so they could connect like puzzle pieces. The researchers found that these rearrangements came in different varieties, called \"tautomeric\" and \"anionic\" forms, though it wasn't clear which ones were responsible for replication errors.\nIn this study, Duke graduate students Isaac Kimsey and Eric Szymanski used an enhanced version of their previous technique to examine the relationship between these shape-shifting bases and the errors made by the DNA-copying polymerase. Again, they caught the G and T bases in the act, and showed that their shape-shifting occurred at about the same rate that polymerases incorporate G-T mismatches.\nTogether with their collaborators at The Ohio State University, they fed their NMR data into a \"kinetic model\" that traced the nearly invisible movements taken by the atoms in the mismatches that result in replication errors. They found that, though the different alternative states each contributed to errors, the tautomeric forms dominated under normal conditions and the anionic forms dominated in the presence of mutagens and environmental stress.\n\"In the past, we knew DNA polymerases make mistakes during DNA replication but did not know how they do it,\" said Zucai Suo, Ph.D., Ohio State professor of chemistry and biochemistry. \"Now, our study provides a mechanistic sense for how the mistakes arise.\"\nThe results provide \"convincing validation for the chemical origins of mutations proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953,\" said Myron Goodman, Ph.D., a professor of molecular biology and chemistry at the University of Southern California, who was not involved in the study. \"It is significant scientifically, and even though it took about 65 years to prove, it also demonstrates the folly of ever betting against Watson and Crick.\"\nThe textbook depiction of the iconic double helix shows a static double-stranded structure, but it turns out that on rare occasions it can morph into other shapes that exist for exceptionally small periods of time,\" Al-Hashimi said. \"Though some might question the importance of such states, there are a growing number of studies showing they can be major drivers of biology and disease. Given the difficulty in observing these phenomena, it makes you wonder how many more states are out there dictating the outcomes of biology that we don't even know about.\"\nOne of the surprising discoveries made by the team was that the frequency at which bases shifted their shapes varied with DNA sequence. In one of their experiments, Ohio State biochemists Zucai Suo and Walter Zahurancik essentially counted the number of times that polymerases incorporated the wrong base into the DNA. They found that mistakes were indeed not uniform: they appeared more frequently in some sequences than others. For example, a region with more Gs and Cs might form more quantum jitters, and subsequently more mutations, than an area that was rich in As and Ts.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

China’s Liaoning province is one place that regularly yields up incredible fossils with traces of feathers, internal organs and even gut contents preserved.\nNow researchers have used a new method to reveal details of the body, skin, feathers and scales of a dinosaur called Anchiornis, which are not visible to the naked eye. Known as laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF), the technique uses a violet laser to stimulate molecules in remnants of organic tissues in the rock to fluoresce or glow in the dark. This effect can be captured on a special camera under dark conditions, revealing otherwise hidden details of fossils.\nAnchiornis is important for understanding both the origin of birds and of flight, Pittman says, as the crow-sized flying dinosaur is thought to be closely related to the ancestor of birds. The scans revealed foot pads and scales on the dinosaur very similar to those seen on chickens today, as well as small flaps of skin under the feathers on the leading edge of the wings. These are known as “propatagia” and are important for flight in birds. “Drumstick-shaped legs” and a thin feathery tail were also exposed.\nThe researchers chose Anchiornis for the study because it is one of the most common feathered dinosaurs found, with about 230 specimens held in Chinese museum collections. This meant the scientists had many fossils from which to select the best soft-tissue preservation.\nLSF is a relatively new technique but has also been used to reveal camouflage patterning on the dinosaur Psittacosaurus, as well as the body shape of an early bird, Confuciusornis.

Scholten.\nThe NRCC cited King's \"words and actions\" — which include race-based remarks and support for far-right politicians — for its decision to sit out the race.\nKing for years has engaged in language viewed as racist. Earlier this month, he tweeted an endorsement of far-right Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, who has appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast.\nRepublicans need every House seat they can win next week — but that doesn't mean Iowa Rep. Steve King, who has been accused of racism, will be getting any last-minute help from the main GOP group responsible for electing party members to Congress.\nOn Wednesday, one of King's Republican colleagues in the House, Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, in an MSNBC interview said, \"I would never cast a ballot for someone like Steve King,\" even if it meant the loss of GOP control of the House.\n\"My principles are more important than any of that,\" Curbelo said. \"His comments and his actions are disgusting.\"\nKing for years has engaged in language viewed as racist. He once described former President Barack Obama, who is black, as \"very, very urban.\" He has displayed a Confederate flag on his desk, and once predicted \"that Hispanics and the blacks will be fighting each other before\" their combined population exceeded the number of whites in the United States.\nEarlier this month, King tweeted an endorsement of far-right Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, who has appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast.\nNonpartisan analysis site Cook Political Report recently shifted its outlook on the 4th District to \"lean Republican,\" a notch down from \"likely Republican,\" after a Democratic poll found King's opponent trailing by just 1 percentage point. King also has been massively outfundraised by Scholten, who has garnered more than $1.7 million in contributions against the incumbent's nearly $740,000.\nAnd King will be getting less money from now on.\nThe political newsletter Popular Information, on Sunday revealed that after it highlighted King's rhetoric, Intel informed employees that it would no longer donate to King.\n\"We looked into the congressman's public statements and determined that they conflict with Intel values,\" Dawn Jones, the company's director of policy and external partnerships, wrote in an email obtained by Popular Information.\nThe mass murder Saturday of 11 Jewish worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue by a gunman, who allegedly told police \"I just want to kill Jews,\" ramped up pressure on King's backers to drop him.\nTwo other companies followed Intel's lead Tuesday.\nThe political action committees of dairy products giant Land O'Lake and Purina, the pet-food subsidiary of Nestle, bowed to online pressure and announced they would not longer support King.\nAmid those moves, GOP Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, chairman of the NRCC, in a tweet Tuesday said he \"strongly condemned\" King's conduct.\nLater Tuesday night, Matt Gorman, spokesman for the NRCC, told Fox News that the group was joining the boycott of King.\n\"The NRCC and Congressman Stivers haven't been afraid to show moral leadership when the time calls for it,\" Gorman said.\n\"We believe Congressman King's words and actions are completely inappropriate and we strongly condemn them. We will not play in his race,\" he added.\nKing fired back at the NRCC in a tweet Tuesday that said \"Establishments Never Trumpers\" are complicit with enemies of President Donald Trump in the effort to \"flip the House\" and impeach the president.\nVice News reported Wednesday that AT&T's PAC, which has already made its contributions for 2018 campaigns, \"will take all concerns\" about King \"very seriously\" when it decides who to give money to in future years, according to an email from an AT&T spokesman.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe shinbun nishiki-e and their role in Japanese media. Respond in 576 words.", "output": "Shinbun nishiki-e were the country’s answer to penny dreadfuls.\nIn 1875, the residents of Tokyo were alerted to a murder. Hundreds of miles away, in the remote mountains, a lonely man named Gitarō had been visited by a local woman who sold old clothing. She asked to stay the night; cordially, he invited her in. Then, far from the eyes of any prying neighbor, he stabbed and killed her, took her money and possessions, and cut off her head. Months later, a dog walked through the village with her severed head in his mouth. The corpse was found, wrapped in a straw mat in the man’s home, and he was caught and arrested.\nThe 1870s brought something of a revolution in Japanese media. Publications today considered Japan’s first modern newspapers sprung up one after another, providing more authoritative views on Tokyo’s stories. Not everyone could read them, however. Printed only in complex kanji, with minimal illustration, they were out of reach to the uneducated. And so shinbun nishiki-e arose to fill the gap and provide an alternative revenue stream for struggling woodblock publishers.\nLike the kawaraban, they told wanton stories, sometimes lifted from the “mainstream” press and reprinted under the original newspaper’s name. There was still kanji text, certainly, but also phonetic hiragana, a simpler syllabary. And they included a vivid illustration for the roughly 60 percent of the population that was entirely illiterate. Shinbun nishiki-e were designed to be accessible and appealing to all, and as a consequence, they sold like onigiri.\nIn these papers, editorial coverage tended towards the sensational—illicit love, ghosts, freaks, revenge. Even when they had some basis in fact, the reporting was only slightly better than in the kawaraban, and multiple competing accounts of the same event might swirl simultaneously. Stories might have been related weeks or even years after they had taken place, rewritten in splashy, didactic copy, sometimes with a moral.\nBut for all their gore, the images are quite beautiful. The lines and colors were often as subtle as their subjects were shocking. Many artists who produced them were among the best in the country, including Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, who contributed mostly to the paper Yubin hochi shinbun and Utagawa Yoshiiku, who cofounded and mainly drew for the Tokyo nichinichi shinbun. People visiting the city bought them as souvenirs and then took them back to the countryside, so friends and family could gawp at the scandal and sophistication of metropolitan affairs. “My god!” wrote one visitor. “What a sign of civilization! What a sign of culture!” For foreigners, they had far less appeal: The text wasn’t legible, and the pictures far less appealing than “Japanese-y” geishas, cherry blossoms, or pastoral scenes.\nShinbun nishiki-e were never intended as art. When profits dwindled, then, they were extinguished like a candle. “Real” newspapers were increasingly illustrated, and a rise in Western printing techniques made these traditional woodblock images seem dated. It was also a slow, laborious way to produce papers—especially if no one was buying. Movable type was faster, Western paper was heartier, and, like locomotives or the telegraph, both were seen as signs of progress. By the end of the 1870s, the shinbun nishiki-e illustrated pages were all but gone, with their one-of-a-kind illustrations as valueless as yesterday’s newsprint.\nThe Obsidian Collection and Google are bringing historic African-American media outlets online.\nThe enduring appeal of the lowest common denominator.\nFed up with sensationalized portrayals, the country's hikikomori are reclaiming their narrative.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The Ritchey Permissive License does (\"The material is provided without warranties of any kind\"), but it also states \"You must be legally capable of being bound to all the requirements of this license\". Would this prevent Australian's from accepting the license, or would portions of the license simply not be upheld in that jurisdiction? ", "output": "Probably\nFirst of all, a warranty is different from a guarantee under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The license purports to exclude the former but not the latter. So, on a literal reading, the license doesn't offend the ACL and is probably fine on that basis alone although this may not be what the licensor intended.\nNotwithstanding, even if \"warranty\" and \"guarantee\" are to be read interchangeably it is not clear that this would offend the ACL. Since this is a supply of services (not goods) there are only three guarantees in the ACL: Guarantee as to due care and skill (60), Guarantees as to fitness for a particular purpose etc. (61) and Guarantee as to reasonable time for supply (62).\nIt should be obvious, given the nature of the website, that 61 and 62 are not going to be applicable. So, this leaves only 60:\n\nIf a person supplies, in trade or commerce, services to a consumer, there is a guarantee that the services will be rendered with due care and skill.\n\nBefore this ACL guarantee is engaged there needs to be a consumer (which there is) and the supply must be \"in trade or commerce\". Trade or commerce is not defined in ACL except circularly in terms of geography:\n\n\"trade or commerce\" means trade or commerce within Australia or between Australia and places outside Australia.\n\nThis is a deliberate choice by the legislature because s51(i) of the Constitution grants the Commonwealth legislative power \"with respect to trade or commerce\" and clearly legislation cannot define a term that is used in the Constitution (without definition) but it can narrow its definition for the purposes of the Act.\n\"Trade or commerce\" is interpreted by the courts based on the totality of the circumstances. A supplier is \"in trade or commerce\" if they are routinely or regularly engaged in 'business' (for-profit or not-for-profit) and the particular supply forms part of that business. However, supplies that are 'personal' rather than 'business' in nature are not captured. Similarly, activities by a 'business' that are not \"in trade or commerce\" such as lobbying (unless their business is as a lobbyist) are excluded.\nNote that the Act refers to \"supply\" - this includes supplies that are neither contracts and/or for which the consumer provides no consideration. For example, a supermarket giving free samples of a foodstuff is a \"supply\" \"in trade or commerce\" and is captured by the ACL.\nWith respect to this particular site, it appears to be a private blog and therefore the supply is not \"in trade or commerce\" so the ACL guarantees are not engaged.\nNow, if you wanted to take something under this license, which requires you to use this license when you 'onsell' and you were doing so in the context of a \"supply\" \"in trade or commerce\" to a \"consumer\", you wouldn't be able to.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Treatment should be done any time construction or repair work is done on the plumbing system, if flood or surface water gets into the well, or if a Department of Health water test for bacteria indicates \"unsatisfactory\" levels of coliform bacteria.\nFollow the steps below to kill the bacteria and reduce the risk of reinfection.\nLook in your yard, basement or well house for a 6-inch diameter rusty pipe sticking up out of the ground. Newer wells look similar to Figure 1 and older wells look similar to Figure 2. Gather whatever information you can about the well, such as age, actual diameter, total depth, casing depth, and standing water level. The well driller, pump installer or previous landowner can be sources of this information.\nFigure 1. Overlapping well cap with skirted sides on well with pitless adapter. Figure 2. Well seal with compressible rubber gasket.\nRemove the well cap by loosening the screws (if like Fig. 1) or unscrew the vent pipe (if like Fig. 2). Thoroughly scrub all accessible surfaces of the well and well house, using 1/2 gallon unscented chlorine (laundry) bleach per 5 gallons of water. Check the bleach label to be sure it contains 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite. Wear rubber gloves and goggles to protect your skin from irritation. Rinse everything with clean water.\nIn a clean plastic 5-gallon bucket, add chlorine bleach at a rate of 1 pint of bleach per 25 feet of water depth in the well, then mix by filling the bucket with water. For example, a 250-foot deep, 6-inch diameter house well with a water level of 100 feet would require 6 pints (3/4 gallon) of bleach to treat the 150-foot column of water in the well. Pour the mixture down the well hole. Or if the well is deep, drop in 1/2 lb. of the small 65-75% calcium hypochlorite (swimming pool chlorine) tablets per 150 feet of water depth in the well.\nConnect a garden hose to a nearby faucet and wash down the inside of the well. Let the water run until a strong chlorine odor comes out the hose. Shut off that faucet, then one by one, open all other faucets and flush toilets in your plumbing system until they smell of chlorine. If a strong odor is not detected, add more chlorine to the well. Chlorinate water softeners and iron or sand filters according to the manufacturer's directions. Don't chlorinate carbon or charcoal filters because it will use up their capacity.\nReplace the well cap or vent pipe. Let the chlorinated water stand in the system at least 12 hours, to give the chlorine time to kill the bacteria. After this waiting period, turn on the faucets to flush the system of remaining chlorine. Start with outside faucets first to avoid overloading the septic system. Let the water run until there is no detectable chlorine odor.\nRetest for bacteria after 7-10 days of use. If the well fails two consecutive tests, continuous disinfection may be necessary.

{"input": "What is the most efficient way to quit your job without giving notice? Could you provide a list of 16 steps?", "output": "In all U.S. states except Montana, employees are presumed to be at-will employees. This means that, unless you have a written contract, you have the right to quit whenever you want, for any reason – or even for no reason at all. However, many employers require that you provide two weeks' notice when you quit. If you don't, the employer may refuse to give you a reference, or withhold payment of accrued leave. This means that if you want to quit your job without giving notice, you need to carefully evaluate your company's policies and make sure it won't cost you more than it's worth.\n1. Consider talking to someone in human resources first.: There may be options available to you if you want to quit without giving notice because you have a personal or family crisis, or because you're the victim of workplace harassment.\n\nIf you have a problem with your work environment, such as an abusive boss or coworker, make sure the person with whom you speak is not involved with or connected to the situation.\nExplain your reasons for wanting to leave immediately, and see if any accommodations can be made.\nFor example, you may be allowed to work out a notice by working from home. However, if your work is not the type of thing you can do remotely, such as if you work on an assembly line, this may not be an option.\nMake sure this meeting will be kept confidential. You don't want everyone knowing you're going to leave until you do so. Otherwise, there might be some backlash.\n2. Search for example letters.: If you're unsure how to compose your letter, you may be able to find samples online that will help guide you. Avoid copying a sample verbatim, though. It might not fit your situation.\n\nTry to find more than one sample. Read them carefully so you understand the substance well enough to make it your own.\nYou typically don't necessarily want your letter to sound to formal or canned. However, if you're delivering the letter to an abusive or problematic boss, a canned letter may be appropriate.\n3. Use traditional business letter format.: As tempting as it may be to fire off an \"I quit\" email, a traditional letter is a better way to go. Even though you're not giving any notice, it shows that you respect your employer.\n\nYou typically can find a business letter template on any word processing application. Using that will make formatting your letter much easier.\nIf your employer has a dedicated human resources department, create two identical letters. One should be addressed to your boss, the other to the head of human resources.\nInclude your personal address on the letter, along with any additional non-company contact information such as your personal phone number or email address.\n4. Maintain a courteous tone.: Regardless of your real feelings about your boss or your job experience, courtesy makes a better impression. Being polite and professional will make it easier to accept your resignation.\n\nState the exact date on which you want your employment to end. Don't say \"effective immediately\" or \"effective at the end of this week.\"\nIf you're writing the letter on September 14 and you expect your last day to be September 16, write \"I am writing to resign my position, effective September 16.\"\nApologize for not being able to provide any notice, and close your letter by thanking your employer for the opportunity.\n5. Keep it brief and to the point.: Show your employer you respect their time. Don't go on a long, rambling rant about your personal issues or your problems with the company. Simply state that you're resigning your position, effective immediately, and leave it at that.\n\nKeep in mind that this letter could come back to haunt you, even if you already have another job lined up. You shouldn't put it past your boss to send a copy of the letter to your new employer – especially if you live and work in a relatively small town, or work in a close-knit industry.\nIf you're not comfortable disclosing the reason you need to resign, you don't have to say anything specific.\nRemember that as an at-will employee, you can leave at any time for any reason at all, or for no reason.\nMention any issues regarding accrued time off or your last paycheck. Some employers require you to come in for an exit interview when you accept your final paycheck.\nYou should generally be open to follow any existing separation procedures, unless doing so would be impossible – for example, if you have to travel far away immediately.\n6. Proofread your letter carefully.: When you've finished your letter, double- and triple-check it for spelling and grammatical errors. You want your last impression to be a good one, and typos or sloppy grammar won't do you any favors.\n\nKeep in mind that some people view the presence of typos as a sign of disrespect. You're signaling that you don't think they're worth the effort to produce the best work.\nAfter you've proofread your letter, print it off and sign it by hand. Make copies of your signed letters for your own records before you take them to your employer.\n7. Hand-deliver your letter.: If at all possible, you want to take the letter to your boss in person rather than mailing it. Mail does have the benefit of being able to later prove the letter was received. However, this benefit is outweighed by the difficulty of timing.\n\nWhen you speak with your boss, be as apologetic as possible. It can help to acknowledge that you understand how your leaving may put them in a bind.\nIf you have a legitimate reason, talk about the situation. They may be able to help you more than they would if you said nothing.\nIf you have any questions about your employer's separation procedures, now is the time to ask them.\nDepending on your position, you may want to offer to help out in the coming weeks or be available by phone or email to answer questions.\nReach out to coworkers or direct supervisors you worked with closely, or with whom you had a strong rapport. You want to thank them personally and let them know you enjoyed working with them, so there are no hard feelings.\n8. Get a copy of your employee handbook.: Most established employers, especially larger corporations, will have a written employee handbook. However, you may not have been given your own copy. \n\nEven if you do have your own copy, it's likely you haven't looked at it since it was given to you when you first started your job.\nIf you don't have a copy, talk to someone in human resources about getting one. If you want to keep your plans a secret, you don't have to tell them why you need it. Just say you want to check the benefits policy.\nYou also may be able to get a hold of an employee handbook on the sly if you know of a coworker who has a copy. Just ask to see theirs.\n9. Review your company's separation policy.: Your employee handbook should have a section dealing with what happens when an employee voluntarily separates from the company. These sections typically state that two weeks' notice is required.\n\nIf the separation policy makes no mention of providing notice, then you have nothing to worry about. However, this is rarely the case.\nYour employer typically will list consequences for quitting without sufficient notice. A typical consequence is that you cannot expect a positive recommendation from the employer after you're gone.\nOften this means that future employers won't have the ability to verify any positive experience or education you've acquired as a result of the job.\nParticularly if you're just starting in a career, this can be a pretty devastating consequence.\n10. Find out what will happen with benefits.: Whether you get money in your final paycheck for accrued leave may be tied to whether you provided notice. If this is the case, you may want to reconsider whether quitting your job without giving notice is worth it.\n\nThis may be particularly important if your employer allows you to accrue paid time off and you've been working there for awhile.\nKeep in mind that in that case, this amount may add up to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.\nHowever, if the reason you must leave without notice involves some emergency, you may be able to make arrangements with your employer to get paid for at least part of this time.\n11. Make arrangements to return all company property.: If you were issued any company property, such as a laptop or a mobile phone, bring them with you on your last day. Find out what the procedures are for checking them back in.\n\nSome employers require all company property to be returned at a scheduled exit interview. If your employer has this policy, get a list from human resources of the property that was checked out in your name so you can make sure everything is returned.\nIf you have a parking pass or badge for building security, your employer likely wants those back too.\nCheck your belongings thoroughly before you leave on your final day, and make sure you aren't inadvertently taking home company property such as office supplies or other materials.\n12. Consult an attorney.: You don't generally need an attorney to quit your job without giving notice – there's no law against it. However, if you have unresolved issues with your employer, you may need legal advice.\n\nIf you happened to be under an employment contract, you are not an at-will employee. It is imperative that you find an experienced employment attorney who can analyze our contract and the penalties for breaking it. Do this before you quit.\nIn some circumstances you may feel as though you were forced to quit. If your workplace was abusive or unsafe, an employment attorney can help you assess your legal options.\nYou also may need legal assistance if something happens after you quit. For example, your employer might seek reimbursement for expenses that were covered while you were an employee.\nThis is most likely to happen if your employer paid for continuing education courses or something similar that has a future benefit.\n13. Have another job lined up.: If you're quitting your job without giving notice because you need to immediately start another job, your decision likely will have few if any negative consequences. However, it's generally good form to make sure your new employer is aware that you are quitting without notice.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that if you quit without notice and without good cause, you probably will not be eligible for unemployment benefits.\nIf you have to quit your job without giving notice because of a family or personal emergency, this may not be possible.\nHowever, to the extent possible, your best option is to seek other employment while you're still working. Once hired, let them know you're available to start immediately.\nSome new jobs may not give you the time to work out a notice. If you fear the job offer will be rescinded if you have to work out a notice, you may have no choice.\nIn any event, making sure your new employer knows that you are quitting your old job without giving notice can spare an unfortunate surprise. If your former employer decides to share this information with your new employer, you won't have to worry about negative consequences.\n14. Request a written reference letter.: Getting a written reference letter from your immediate supervisor before your last day can cut through a lot of red tape. This letter can be especially valuable depending on your employer's notice policy.\n\nYou also should keep in mind that someone's opinion might change. When you leave, you may create a vacuum that leaves your immediate supervisor and coworkers scrambling.\nIn light of increased stress and an expanded workload, they may not be as generous in describing your time working with them.\nKeep in mind that providing a written reference is no guarantee that a new employer won't call your old job. However, it can lessen their motivation to do so.\n15. Refrain from lying on job applications.: If you're filling out a standard application for a job, it likely will require information about how you left your job. Often you must specify whether you provided notice.\n\nAs tempting as it may be, don't check the box indicating that you gave notice if you didn't.\nA potential employer can easily find out this information by calling your own employer, and may do so even if you state that you prefer they aren't contacted.\nDespite answering \"no\" when asked if a former employer can be contacted, a prospective employer still may call to verify that the information you provided was correct.\nAside from that, telling a prospective employer that they can't contact a former employer is typically a bad idea. It sends up red flags by signaling to the prospective employer that you left on bad terms.\n16. Be prepared to explain your decision.: When you leave a job without notice, it may come up in future interviews. Employers often look at employees who quit without notice as people who didn't respect their employer.\n\nParticularly if you have another job lined up when you quit, leaving this employer without giving notice may not make any difference.\nHowever, be aware that there are some managers who are sticklers about this sort of thing. They may have seemingly arbitrary rules such as never hiring someone who has quit a job without notice. This isn't something you can predict or control.\nIf you have a legitimate explanation for why you quit without giving notice, share it with prospective employers.\nIf your former employer understood and didn't fault you for leaving, sharing their response to your resignation will look even better.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the experience of playing Retrovirus on the Oculus Rift with regards to immersion.", "output": "We’re now back from PAX and ready to rock.\nThe most intuitive use of the Rift is in simulation games that make use of familiar objects. Racing games, flight sims, and military combat games all present environments that we have seen often enough to feel grounded in reality. Even first person fantasy and horror games can benefit from familiarity mixed with imagination. Where does that leave Retrovirus, where the player controls an antivirus program in a zero gravity computer world?\nOne of the interesting side effects of using the Rift in a completely unfamiliar setting is that many of its limitations become less noticeable. The low resolution and lack of positional tracking have less impact on the game, as the player doesn't have expectation for how the world should look or behave. Even when graphically incense situations cause the framerate to drop, the Rift continues to be quite usable when one isn't making the association that a real place is stuttering. Though I have experienced motion sickness in many Rift game, Half Life 2 included, I have not experienced any discomfort after many hours of continuous play in Retrovirus, quite likely because of the lack of dissonance between what I see and what my brain expects.\nWhen even the distance from the ground is variable, a player can shed the traditional notion of immersion and become open to a new world with new rules.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Running applications won't show up here (unlike Dash) though. But for that you have the official Gnome Shell \"dock\" extension.\nApplications menu in the panel: the Activities button is replaced with an \"Applications\" button and will no longer take you to the Activities overview (you still have the top left corner hotspot for this) and instead it will launch a nice app menu. But unlike the old Gnome 2 menu, this one comes with collapsible entries so you'll have to click each category instead of hovering.\nDisable dynamic workspaces: a very useful extension for those who want a predefined number of workspaces instead of dynamic workspaces. Remember to change the number of workspaces using gconf-editor (apps > metacity > general > num_workspaces).\nEven though the extensions are provide as a pack, you can of course install only those that you want.\nBefore proceeding with the installation, please note that I've only tested these GNOME Shell extensions with the latest GNOME Shell from GIT (build as of today). They should work with older versions but I'm not sure what's the minimum required version.\nThen reload GNOME Shell or log out and log back in.\nOr, if you want to install them manually, download the extensions from HERE, extract the package, press CTRL + H and you should see a hidden \".local\" folder wherever you've extracted it - there, navigate to .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and copy the extensions to the ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ folder.\nThanks to Charles Bowman for the tip!", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Hey, could you tell me more about airdrop funding models?", "output": "Today, we’re launching another exciting new series — BlockchainX. It’s the first series entirely dedicated to the non-tech readers of the blockchain community.\nIn the first article of the series, we are going to explore the Airdrops on the EOS Blockchain. What is an airdrop? Why is it becoming a new funding model for blockchain startups? What are currently the problems the model is facing?\nBefore we deep dive in the airdrop funding model, you should be familiar with what an airdrop is in the blockchain space.\nThe airdrop thing is not something new. There have been airdrops since the first ICO on Ethereum Blockchain.\nIn the beginning, the primary purpose of the airdrops was to bring awareness to you and your product. There is a high chance that you have found tokens in your wallet which weren’t supposed to be there.\nA blockchain startup is building their dApp on EOS Blockchain. They want to airdrop tokens. The company has a Total Supply of Tokens equal to 1 billion. They keep 20% of all tokens for themselves and airdrop the remaining 80% to all EOS Token Holders.\nCurrently, most of the airdrops on EOS use the genesis snapshot and your balance during it.\nIf the airdrop is 1:1, then you’ll receive one token, because you had 1 EOS during the genesis snapshot. Alternatively, 25 tokens if you had 25 EOS. It doesn’t matter if you don’t own these EOS anymore. It’s important what you had during the snapshot.\nSo the company airdropped 800 million tokens and kept 200 million of the SAME tokens for themselves.\nAt this moment we have the following result: 80% airdropped tokens without a value. How could this be a funding model?\nAfter the airdrop, the company still owns 20% of all tokens which are currently 200 million. These tokens are “put” to the market, and there is market valuation. Thus the market will determine if the product of the company (the dApp) and the tokens are valuable.\nThat is where the most exciting part is happening, and it is called the Feedback Loop.\nThe company has the incentive to increase the value of the airdrop.\nOn the other side, we have token holders who have received free tokens. Suddenly the tokens are becoming to have some value, and as token holders, they have an incentive to improve the service. When doing it, they are not only bringing more value to the system and themselves but are also delivering value to everyone else — the remaining token holders which are part of the system too.\nThe token holders have an incentive to involve new users which could potentially increase the demand and the value of the tokens for everyone in the system.\nSo how an airdrop could become a funding model for blockchain startups? The company owns 200 million tokens. When the market deems that the company, the project, the product, the tokens are valuable then potentially the price will go up.\nLet’s say the price per token reaches $0.20 then the company will have 40 million dollars.\nSo, without doing an ICO with all the regulation currently occurring. Without receiving or claiming any money from the EOS Token Holders, and without any investors the company could manage to fund themselves from the airdrop. Even more, thanks to the feedback loop everyone is part of the system and they have an incentive for it and for themselves to become more valuable.\nHowever, as with any new technology, idea, model, there are currently a few problems.\nWhat are the problems the model is facing?\nOne of the first problems was the price of the RAM. For the companies to airdrop tokens in the EOS network, a RAM is required. Why?\nThat could be a whole new story for those who are not familiar with how the EOS Blockchain work, but long story short — RAM is used to store data in an in-memory database, and to use it somebody should pay for it.\nIn the case with the airdrops this somebody is the company airdropping the tokens. In July the prices were skyrocketing and in order to lower the cost of running dApps, the EOS Block Producers have voted to increase the RAM supply.\nThough the airdrop funding model is still an infant for many people and there is a long way to go before it becomes established funding model, it has the potential to replace the ICOs which undergoes a crisis at the moment.\nOne way or another we’ll continue to keep you up to date with the airdrop funding model!

Total market capitalization plunged below $200 billion and kept going to reach its lowest level since the end of October 2017.\nBitcoin briefly dipped below $6k once again and is holding the level just above it. With a loss of 6.5% on the day BTC is down to $6,050 and poised for further declines. Trade volume has dropped from $6.6 billion to just over $5 billion at the time of writing.\nEthereum has crashed, taking an epic nosedive of 17.5% to trade at $265. This puts it back to mid-2017 price ranges when sentiment was largely bullish. Over the past week ETH has shed 35% as its market cap dumped nearly $15 billion. From a July high of just over $500 Ethereum has crashed almost 50% marking its biggest decline since early January. Ethereum has not been this low since September 15 last year when it briefly dipped to $200. Many have blamed ICO projects for dumping ETH onto the market as all cryptos get pummeled. The dust may settle at around $200 which has been a strong support point for Ethereum in the past.\nAll altcoins are dumping once again with Cardano taking the biggest hit in the top ten of 19.4% on the day. Bitcoin Cash, XRP and EOS are not far behind with losses of 14-16%. The market cap chart has certainly been shaken up by the August rout which has continued unabated. In the top twenty there are four altcoins getting absolutely smashed with over 20% declines on the day. These include Tron, Iota, Neo and Binance Coin, the latter taking the biggest dump of 23%.\nNot a single coin in the top one hundred is green at the moment, not even the stablecoins such as Tether, Dai and TrueUSD.

The human being behind the wheel must still stand ready to supervise, to intervene, and to initiate any lane changes, by flicking the turn stalk.\nThat flick-the-stalk requirement was instituted back in May 2015, as this blog reported in a post entitled “Tesla's Robocar to Driver: Accept the Liability, Buster.” Yet despite Tesla’s effort to make drivers pay attention to the road, almost one year later—on 7 May 2016—a distracted driver died after slamming his Tesla Model S into a truck. That death hit the industry hard.\nSo after all these years, a Tesla is allowed only to suggest making a turn. And that’s precisely what rival cars do, notably the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise—which our own Lawrence Ulrich calls the current standard for self-driving prowess in a production car. Then again, Super Cruise was never billed as being anything more than a driver’s helper; its very name is unprepossessing.\nSo Tesla is not alone in facing headwinds. But Elon Musk, its mercurial chief executive, has made far more “I got this” robocar promises than anyone else.

Should I request to land the other way (Rwy 9 vs 27), proceed as normal but just expect them to only be a distraction?  What are the best options here?", "output": "I think the answer depends on what the birds are doing, but all options are basically \"at the pilot's risk\" - the tower is just advising you there are some birds hanging around the airport, but nobody can say how they're going to react to you trying to land there too.\n\nIf the flock is airborne and flying across the final (completely neglecting to coordinate their movements with tower, as birds are wont to do) you can request an extended downwind until they've moved on.\nThis has happened to me twice, and in my experience birds tend to be far less interested in airports than pilots. They're usually gone in a minute or two.\nIf they're sitting on the runway somewhere you can try a low pass over the field to scare them off, but my preference would be to ask the tower/unicom operator if they can chase them away for me with a ground vehicle (so I'm not near the flock in case they decide to disperse \"upward\" instead of \"outward\").\nIf they're just pecking around in the grass near the approach end of the runway looking for lunch Skip Miller & p1l0t have the right idea with a go-around or low approach/overflight to scare them off.\n(This is part of why a low pass over an unattended uncontrolled field is often advisable -- you'll hopefully scare off any critters on the runway that you wouldn't want there when you actually land.)\nIf they're \"airport birds\" you might want to just land.\nSome of the airports by me have resident flocks of birds that I'm convinced just sit there and rate people's landings - I swear I saw the same birds every day shooting touch-and-gos.\nThese are the kind of birds that aren't going to scatter when you do a low pass unless you hit them with your landing gear, so just be aware of where they are (in case they lose their minds and try to commit suicide by propeller) but they probably won't bother you.\n\nI don't think I'd ask for a downwind landing because of birds (unless we're talking geese or hawks or something), but if it's a calm-wind day, the pattern is empty, and you're more comfortable with that idea go ahead and ask.

{"input": "Respond in 477 words. Explain the context and significance of the Trump-Putin summit meeting in July 2017.", "output": "Cooperation with Russia is imperative, but never has the US political-media elite’s opposition to it been so virulent.\nCohen argues that a new détente—cooperation in place of conflict—with Russia is imperative due to the unprecedented dangers of the new Cold War, with conflicts from Ukraine and the Baltic region to Syria fraught with real dangers of direct military action between the two nuclear superpowers. President Trump’s summit meeting—as they were called in the 20th century—with Russian President Putin, in Hamburg on July 7, was therefore good news. In effect, the two leaders became détente partners, or at least aspiring ones. The bad news is the unprecedented attacks by a very large part of the US political-media establishment not only on the meeting but on any kind of détente.\nThough we do not know all that was discussed and agreed upon in Hamburg—détente partners have always kept some “secrets” to protect the diplomatic process of cooperation—Cohen thinks the “summit’s” four main achievements were: formalizing and symbolizing the new détente partnership between the American and Russian presidents; agreement to cooperate in Syria against terrorist forces there, not only in the limited ways announced, but in more expansive ways, which meant agreeing with Moscow that Syrian President Assad must remain at least until ISIS is fully defeated; creating a bilateral US-Russian channel for negotiating a settlement of the Ukrainian civil and proxy war, thereby bypassing, or reducing, the role played thus far by Germany and France, which has largely failed; and agreeing to discuss ways to limit the dangers of cyber technology in international affairs. Though Trump was forced to talk back this agenda item, no doubt it remains on the US-Russian agenda, a subject of negotiation, as it should be, considering the ways in which cyber attacks could undermine nuclear security on both sides.\nCohen and Batchelor then discuss the prospects of each of these agreements. Cohen points out that Putin is under pressure at home to retaliate in kind, however belatedly, to Obama’s “sanctions” imposed in December 2016— in particular, the seizing of two real estate properties owned by Russia in the United States and the expulsion of 35 purported Russian intelligence agents posing as diplomats. To do so now would further jeopardize the new Trump-Putin détente process, so Putin is hoping Trump will at least return the properties to Russia.\nNeither Cohen nor Batchelor is unduly optimistic about the prospects of the Trump-Putin détente. Major political problems exist on both sides, but particularly in Washington. Cohen points out that if, as some informed commentators think, “Russiagate” is mainly the product of some US intelligence agencies and their allies in the mainstream media and in Congress, outright attempts to undermine any détente are likely. Was it merely coincidence, he asks, that new “Russiagate” leaks to media appeared on the eve of the Trump-Putin meeting and immediately after it?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the research study on rat mothers and their impact on baby brain development.", "output": "Rat mothers that nurture their pups aren't just being good moms -- they're also influencing how the babies' brains form, according to a new study in the journal Current Biology. When researchers at New York University monitored half a dozen rat mothers and their newborns, the scientists discovered the pups' brains had bursts of activity as they were groomed or fed.\nIn mammals, a mother's sensory stimulation -- such as keeping the young warm or providing milk -- \"helps sculpt and mold the infant's growing brain,\" Regina Sullivan, a neurobiologist at NYU and an author of the study, says.\nThe researchers observed nearly 100 hours of video as mama rats cared for their pups. By simultaneously monitoring the rats' brain functions, the biologists report that neural activity during grooming increased by about 100 percent. There were similar upswings when the pups drank milk, and also changes when the mom left the nest.\nIt's not just young rats that can benefit from a caring mom. For all mammals, the first stages of life are critical for neural development, as permanent pathways are hard-wired into our brains. \"The study also helps explain how differences in the way mothers nurture their young could account, in part, for the wide variation in infant behavior among animals, including people,\" Sullivan says.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to relate to someone. Can you provide 14 detailed steps?", "output": "1. Look for similarities in personality, experiences, or values. Find activities or interests you both enjoy. Take time to focus on those and find out why the person likes what she likes.\n\nIf you just met someone and want to relate to her, stick to small talk to find common interests. For example, you could talk about the sports teams in your area that have been winning or about any new movies that came out.\n\nAsk open-ended questions to learn more about her interests and experiences. For example, you might ask “What do you do in your spare time?” or “How did you decide on that career?”\n2. Take time to hear and understand both the words and emotional content of what the other person is saying. If you can listen well, you'll be able to connect to the other person better.\n\nFocus your attention on the other person. Avoid distractions like checking your phone or preparing what you're going to say once he is done talking.\n\nAvoid judging or criticizing.\n\nSummarize what he has said to you to show your understanding. You can say, “It sounds like you're feeling…” or “I'm hearing that you're feeling... is that right?”\n3. Empathy means being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes and see her perspective. If you work on trying to understand where the other person is coming from, you will better be able to relate to her. Understanding that your experience of life is not everyone else's and realizing that everyone is just doing their best with the knowledge they have will increase your empathy and allow you to better relate to others, even those who are very different from you.\n\nBuild empathy by listening to the other person and validating her perspective. If possible, you can get know her situation better by spending time with her in her environment — such as with her family, in her home, going to events that are important to her, learning her history, and so on.\nMaybe you have an easy time expressing your emotions and the other person is very closed off, for example. It might be hard for you to understand why she can't take emotional risks, until you get to know her better and realize that her family never says \"I love you\" or talks about their feelings; whereas in your family, open communication was encouraged.\n4. Show true interest in learning more about the other person. If you're fake or not really interested in relating to him, he will be able to pick up on it. Don't force the conversation. Instead, try to:\n\nAsk him questions about himself, but be mindful of getting too personal too soon.\nEncourage him to relate and connect by also sharing things about yourself.\nMake plans with him or exchange contact information. Schedule time with him to get to know him better.\n5. Accept that you don't have to like or agree with everyone you meet. Some differences of opinion can actually make life more interesting, or open your eyes to different ways of thinking. Take time to learn the other person's perspective.\n\nIf someone really irritates you or is different from you and you're having difficulty relating to her, determine what really bothers you about her.\n\nFocus on her positive attributes or what she contributes.\n\nAvoid trying to change her.\n6. Part of relating is feeling a connection, which usually comes from a certain level of intimacy and trust. This does not happen overnight. Give your relationship with the other person time to grow and progress — don't try to force a level of intimacy when you haven't reached that point. Remember that some people are an open book, while others will need more time to reveal themselves to you.\n\nIf the other person says he is not comfortable with sharing something, don't push it. Say something like, \"Okay, no problem. Just know I'm here if you ever want to talk about it.\"\nShow the person over time that you are trustworthy by always following through with your promises, keeping his private business private, admitting when you are wrong, and showing empathy.\n7. Show your concern and care by offering her a safe space to talk about her mental health condition. Encourage her to talk about her feelings and try to listen to her without judging. Ask meaningful questions and be consistent about checking in, as many people with mental health disorders might have difficulty with emotional expression.\n\nYou might ask, “How I can support you right now? What do you need?”\n\nAvoid asking questions that have a judgmental tone, such as “Why do you feel that way?”, “What's wrong with you?”, or “Shouldn't you be doing better by now?”\n\nTactfully ask about specific feelings or symptoms that you might not understand, such as what flashbacks or nightmares are like for someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD. You might say something like, \"I have never experienced that before. Would you be comfortable telling me what that's like for you?\"\n8. Make time to research and learn everything you can about his condition. You'll be better able to understand his perspective and help him if you know about symptoms, treatment, and what to expect for his specific diagnosis.\n\nLook for online resources. The National Alliance on Mental Illness has many resources available for family and friends of people struggling with mental illness.\n\nLook for books at your local library related to his diagnosis. Seek out reliable sources, such as books written by licensed counselors or medical doctors. Consult your librarian or the library's online portal if you need help.\nTalk to his doctor and/or offer to go to doctor's appointments with him.\n\nJoin a support group. Find online forums or local support groups for yourself. For example, if a loved one is struggling with an addiction and you're having difficulty relating to them, find an Al-Anon support group.\n9. Be patient with the other person and understand that even if she does seek treatment, she may struggle with her symptoms or diagnosis for a long time. She won't be cured overnight. Expect setbacks to occur and try to remember that the mental illness is not her fault.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to have some healthy expectations, as expecting too little of someone with a mental illness can slow down her recovery process and enable her.\n\nEncourage the other person to get active or stay involved in her treatment.\nDon't expect too much of yourself, either. Offer your help with any small tasks that you can help with, but don't do too much and burn yourself out. This will lead to resentment and frustration with the other person.\n10. When someone has a mental illness, he may have difficulty connecting or relating to you in “normal” ways. Keep in mind his unique symptoms when scheduling time with him. Don't take it too personally if the other person says hurtful things, is irritable, or doesn't want to spend time with you.\n\nFor example, if a person has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he is currently in a manic episode, he may have a lot of energy and racing thoughts. Since he is already over-stimulated, try to spend time with him in quiet surroundings, allow him to take short naps if he needs to, and provide small snacks for him since he may have difficulty remembering to eat or sitting still to eat.\n\nIf a person has been diagnosed with depression, encourage him to go for a walk or get moving. He may not be motivated, but physical activity with someone else will boost his mood.\n11. The best way to relate to someone who's been experiencing poor physical health is to show you care by spending quality time with her. Distract her and make her feel supported rather than isolated by her illness. Try to:\n\nMake regular contact in-person and in other ways, such as writing to her or calling her. Don't avoid her out of awkwardness or discomfort.\nDo something fun with her while you're there, such as watching a favorite movie, going for a walk, or reading to her.\nMake her laugh. Don't be gloomy every time you go visit.\nTalk about shared, fun memories or experiences you had together.\n12. Don't try to make assumptions or read the other person's mind about what he needs. Check in on him to better understand how he is feeling.\n\nAsk about his feelings in the face of any diagnosis, whether terminal or not. You might ask, \"Are you scared?\" or \"Are you feeling worried about what's going to happen next?\"\nAsk about any experiences or sensations of discomfort. You might ask, \"Are you comfortable? Can I get you another pillow?\"\nAsk what he needs from you. For example, he may need help with paperwork, finances, cooking, or errands.\n\nIf the other person has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, you might ask what his preferences are about end-of-life care. Inquire about treatment he is considering and how treatment is going.\n13. You might not know exactly what to say to someone who is sick or dying, but that's okay. Try to just be accepting of how she is feeling. Be willing to listen to tough or uncomfortable emotions, such as fear or anger.\n\nLet your friend be negative if she needs to be. Don't force her to be positive or look on the bright side.\n\nDon't try to fix the problem or offer medical advice.\n\nAvoid making vague statements like saying, “You're so strong.” While this may be encouraging for some people, others may feel exhausted or invalidated.\n14. Don't be afraid to provide physical comfort to someone. Your reaction may be to avoid touching someone who is sick or dying, but touch can be very comforting to someone, especially if he is no longer able to talk. You can: \n\nHug him.\nHold his hand.\nGive him a back rub.\nWet his lips with a sponge.\nStroke his hair.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe the San Francisco Jewish Community Federation's support for radical, right-wing, Islamophobic, bigoted, and McCarthyite groups and the implications for the community.", "output": "The Federation’s tax filings reveal a litany of radical-right and anti-Muslim groups that have received its support for years. The Federation says its review process has recently been strengthened but refuses to account for its funding of notorious Islamophobic hate groups.\nFollowing the revelation last week in The Forward that the San Francisco Jewish Federation gave $100,000 to Canary Mission, the shadowy website that blacklists and intimidates students and professors who criticize Israel, the Federation assured its constituents that it was a “one-time grant” that would never happen again. But Canary Mission is just the tip of the iceberg.\nAn extensive review by +972 of the Federation’s tax filings shows that the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco and the Helen Diller Family Foundation, which the former controls and which it used to fund Canary Mission, have bankrolled an extensive list of extremist, far-right, anti-Muslim organizations in recent years.\nAmong the extremist, radical right-wing, and anti-Muslim groups that received funds from the SF Federation, both directly and through the Diller Foundation, and some of which have received substantial and repeated grants over the years, include: Project Veritas, The AMCHA Initiative, The American Freedom Law Center, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, The David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the work of Islamophobic Dutch politician Geert Wilders (through the International Freedom Alliance Foundation). Others include the Clarion Fund, the Center for Security Policy (Frank Gaffney), the Middle East Forum (Daniel Pipes), the Tea Party Patriots Foundation, and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\nThe AMCHA Initiative, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the SF Federation and the Diller Foundation in recent years, operates similarly to Canary Mission, except that it primarily goes after faculty, not students.\nThe David Horowitz Freedom Center, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years, has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as promoting anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes.\nThe American Freedom Law Center and Pamela Geller’s American Freedom Defense Initiative both target Islam as a threat to Western civilization. The former advances “anti-Sharia” legislation and filed an amicus brief in support of Trump’s Muslim ban. The latter, which has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group, was responsible for Islamophobic bus campaigns in several cities, and has been represented by the American Freedom Law Center.\nWe review each grant recommendation at the time that it is submitted to the Federation, to determine if the organization adheres to the Federation’s granting guidelines. This applies to organizations across the political spectrum. We aim to make the best decisions with the information that we have at the time. Because organizations are dynamic, an organization that previously received a grant from the Federation may not be in compliance with the Federation’s grantmaking guidelines today, and vice versa. Also, per our statement, we strengthened the implementation of our review process in 2017 and continue to be committed to executing our grant review with a standard of care in regard to our guidelines.\nPhilp added that the Federation does indeed deny grants when they violate its guidelines but would not address any of the grants to the organizations listed in this article or why they were approved.\nThe San Francisco Jewish Community Federation is one of the largest Jewish charities in the United States with a budget of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. Furthermore, it is located in, and presumably represents, one of the most progressive cities and communities in the United States. Whether the SF Federation’s financial support of radical, right-wing, Islamophobic, bigoted, and McCarthyite groups aligns with that community’s values is ultimately up to its members.\n“if you’re a racist the world should know.” unless you set up a 501c4 to dissociate your name from your beliefs.\n“It is pretty clear that the organized Jewish community – unless pushed – is never going to be as rigorous at enforcing boundaries on the right as it is on the left. This comes from an extremely misplaced sense of what is a threat to our community.\nWe students see the damage that Canary Mission is doing on our campuses.\n+972 gets funded by the German green party.\n$14,500 – A grant from Heinrich Böll Stiftung Israel.\nWhy am I not surprised that this Federation supports hate groups?\nDaniel Gold (“I hope your website goes down”) perfectly expresses the real ethos and mission and ethics of Canary Mission and its supporters in the Federation.\nThis congregation sounds very much like what I have heard from my fellow Southerners throughout the years (except in our case, our racism has extended to Jews as well as all Others who do not fit within our identity circle).\nOur reputation is known world wide.

We don't make such a distinction for other platforms for playing by chatting.*\nPutting it another way: are we expecting to have video-game-roleplaying experts now? No, we aren't! And a singular tag for them to be experts in would be absurd anyway: no-one can be expert in that tag because the scope of video games is ridiculously large. Expertise in roleplaying within one video game can't translate to expertise in roleplaying within a different video game… unless the video game itself is irrelevant, in which case so is the tag. For the same reason that we have system tags, we would need specific-video-game tags, which development would make it obvious how off topic the whole thing is.\nAs a secondary problem, it will likely encourage people to misinterpret the tag and submit questions about CRPGs.\n\n* Though we do have, e.g., roll20, that's because questions specific to that software's features are on-topic by its own merits, like anydice's relationship to statistics, or both to tools.\n\nA:\n\nIf we must have a tag with “video game” in the name, it should have the hyphen between the two words.\nAnd roleplay-in-video-games* would be better and clearer, seeming less like a tag about CRPGs and more obviously about using them as a platform.\n\n* We appear to have standardised our tags on roleplaying rather than hyphenating it, despite our title.", "output": "Tag gone.

This equates to about six or more standard drinks for men and four for women.\nThe study, published in the Lancet Public Health Journal, found that between 2008-2016, 1.1 million of the total 31.6 million people discharged from hospital had been diagnosed with dementia.\nOver that same time period, 945,512 people were diagnosed with alcohol use disorders, the vast majority of which suffered from alcohol dependency.\nDr Michaël Schwarzinger, who lead the research, said heavy drinking also increased the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, atrial fibrillation and heart failure which in turn could lead to vascular dementia.\nHe added that smoking, depression and low educational attainment, which are also connected to chronic drinking, were also risk factors in developing dementia.\nDr Sara Imarisio, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, warned that even moderate drinkers were at risk of brain damage and said the French study had failed to reveal “the full extent of the link between alcohol use and dementia risk” as it only examined people admitted to hospital because of chronic drinking.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I’d be happy to slaughter them.\n“If Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have ...,” he said, pausing and pointing to himself.\nU.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Adama Dieng, expressed alarm and urged the Philippines leader to exercise restraint in his use of language, a U.N. statement said.\nDieng also called on Duterte to support an investigation into the reported rise in killings resulting from his anti-drug campaign, the statement said.\nIn August, Duterte threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the United Nations after it called for an end to the killings.\nIn Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Anna Richey-Allen, had repeated concerns about reports of extrajudicial killings but offered no response to Duterte’s comment referring to Hitler.\nHow relations between the U.S. and the Philippines evolve will depend more on what Duterte does than on what he says, administration officials have said.\nU.S. officials had said they would use the defense chiefs meeting in Hawaii to clarify comments by Duterte that throw into doubt his commitment to military ties with the United States, including joint exercises and patrols.\n“And like all alliances it depends on the continuation of a sense of shared interests. So far in US-Philippine history we have had that. We would look forward to continuing that but that’s something that we continue to discuss with the Philippine government,” he said.\nSince Duterte took office on June 30, more than 3,100 people have been killed since then, mostly alleged drug users and dealers, in police operations and vigilante killings.\nDuterte, who was elected in May on the back of a vow to end drugs and corruption in the country of 100 million people, has insulted Obama and in a number of remarks he has undermined the relationship between Manila and Washington.\nJewish groups quickly condemned Duterte’s Hitler comments.\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Digital Terrorism and Hate project, called them “outrageous”.\n“Duterte owes the victims (of the Holocaust) an apology for his disgusting rhetoric,” Cooper said.\nDuterte has said there will be no annual war games between the Philippines and the United States until the end of his six-year term, and his hostility may make Washington’s strategy of rebalancing its military focus toward Asia in the face of an increasingly assertive China more difficult to achieve.\nMurray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Obama was “taking the long view” in dealing with Duterte.

{"input": "What is a Playfair cipher?", "output": "The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher. The Playfair is significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. Frequency analysis can still be undertaken, but on the 25*25=625 possible digraphs rather than the 25 possible monographs. Frequency analysis thus requires much more ciphertext in order to work. For a tutorial on breaking Playfair with a simulated annealing algorithm, see Cryptanalysis of the Playfair Cipher.\nIt was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment. A typical scenario for Playfair use would be to protect important but non-critical secrets during actual combat. By the time the enemy cryptanalysts could break the message the information was useless to them .\nThe coastwatchers regularly used the Playfair system. Evans deciphered it with the key ROYAL NEW ZEALAND NAVY [note that this is key square ROYALNEWZDVBCFGHIKMPQSTUX] and learned of Kennedy's fate. [...] About ten hours later, at 10:00 p.m. Kennedy and his crew was rescued.\nNote the ciphertext above has some errors in it, see this comment for a more correct version.\nThe 'key' for a playfair cipher is generally a word, for the sake of example we will choose 'monarchy'. This is then used to generate a 'key square', e.g.\nAny sequence of 25 letters can be used as a key, so long as all letters are in it and there are no repeats. Note that there is no 'j', it is combined with 'i'. We now apply the encryption rules to encrypt the plaintext.\nRemove any punctuation or characters that are not present in the key square (this may mean spelling out numbers, punctuation etc.).\nIdentify any double letters in the plaintext and replace the second occurence with an 'x' e.g. 'hammer' -> 'hamxer'.\nIf the plaintext has an odd number of characters, append an 'x' to the end to make it even.\nThe algorithm now works on each of the letter pairs.\nFor a tutorial on breaking Playfair with a simulated annealing algorithm, see Cryptanalysis of the Playfair Cipher.\nObtaining the key is relatively straightforward if both plaintext and ciphertext are known, however we want to find the key without knowing the plaintext. Guessing some of the words using knowledge of where the message came from, when it came from, etc. can be a huge help in reconstructing the key square. It should be recognized that guessing some of the plaintext and using that to reconstruct the keysquare is by far the easiest way to crack this cipher.\nCryptanalysis of the playfair cipher is much more difficult than normal simple substitution ciphers, because digraphs (pairs of letters) are being substituted instead of monographs (single letters). If we use frequency analysis of english digraphs, we can use this information in the same way as we used the monograph frequencies, however, there are ~600 digraphs and only 26 monographs. We need far more ciphertext for the digraphic system to make reliable key choices compared to the monographic system.\nWhen cryptanalysing by hand, the following trick can be used. A Playfair digraph and its reverse (e.g. AB and BA) will decrypt to the same letter pattern in the plaintext (e.g. RE and ER). In English, there are many words which contain these reversed digraphs such as REceivER and DEpartED. Identifying nearby reversed digraphs in the ciphertext and matching the pattern to a list of known plaintext words containing the pattern is an easy way to generate possible plaintext strings with which to begin constructing the key. A good tutorial on reconstructing the key for a Playfair cipher can be found in chapter 7, \"Solution to Polygraphic Substitution Systems,\" of Field Manual 34-40-2, produced by the United States Army.\nThe cipher message contains an even number of letters.\nA frequency count will show no more than 25 letters (with no letter J).\nIf long repeats occur, they will be separated by an even number of characters. Repeated sequences will usually be an even number of characters.\nWhen Solving by computer, an easy way of finding a key is to start with a random square of letters. Minor changes are then introduced (i.e. swapping letters in the key) to see if the candidate plaintext is more like standard plaintext than before the change (e.g. using markov models, or trigram frequency counts). If the new square is deemed to be an improvement (plaintext has higher likelyhood), then it is adopted and then further mutated to find an even better candidate. Eventually, the plaintext or something very close to it is found by chosing the key that provides a plaintext with the highest likelyhood.\nLecture 3 \"Cryptanalysis of the Classical Ciphers\", by Dr. Alex Biryukov.\nSimon Singh's 'The Code Book' is an excellent introduction to ciphers and codes, and includes a section on playfair ciphers.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "\"Paragraph: \"We may be months — at least — away from a vaccine to protect against COVID-19, but in the meantime the public is turning its eyes to drugs that could be used to treat it. Among the first to be lauded as a possible solution was the antiviral drug remdesivir, which attacks the coronavirus to prevent it from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial run in April found that patients who took the drug were more likely to recover from the disease — and do so faster — than patients who took a placebo pill. But as excitement about remdesivir amps up, criticism has followed over the price that Gilead Sciences, the drug’s manufacturer, wants to charge for it. U.S. insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, will pay $3,120 for a five-day course of the drug, while other developed countries will pay about a third less because they’ll purchase from generic manufacturers to which Gilead has licensed production. The move has angered many, including the progressive advocacy group and think tank Public Citizen, which tweeted on June 29, 2020 about the price declaration, writing, \"\"Taxpayers spent $70,000,000 to develop this drug. It should be in the public domain. Instead, Big Pharma is robbing us blind.\"\" Parts of the tweet, course, are opinions. But the $70 million claim is stated as a fact. How much did taxpayers spend to develop remdesivir? Let’s dig in. To back up the organization’s claim, Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen’s Access to Medicine director, sent a May 7, 2020 post published on their site titled, \"\"The real story of remdesivir.\"\" Amid the worldwide Ebola outbreak in 2015, the U.S. government partnered with Gilead to identify a drug that targeted the Ebola virus and was successful in blocking the infection in Rhesus monkeys. That drug would later come to be known as remdesivir. In 2017, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report noted that an entity within the Department of Defense would cost-share with Gilead for \"\"continued development of this product,\"\" noting its antiviral activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses. The Department of Defense has spent $34.5 million so far on this effort. Also in 2017, the National Institutes of Health issued a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to speed the development of remdesivir. And as the novel coronavirus made its way into the world, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of NIH, announced it would funnel $30 million into the aforementioned clinical trial for remdesivir. Since the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health are funded through federal taxes, these three payments add up to what Public Citizen claimed. Public Citizen wrote that taxpayers paid $70 million to develop remdesivir. Three separate projects from agencies that are funded by taxpayer dollars, adding up to $70 million, have commenced since 2015.

{"input": "What are the 12 fundamental steps to consider when attempting to persuade people with subconscious techniques?", "output": "One of the most significant skills everyone should learn is the key to persuasiveness, because it is useful in countless situations. At work, home, and in your social life, the ability to be persuasive and influence others can be instrumental for achieving goals and being happy.Learning about the tricks of persuasion can also give you insight into when they're being used on you. The biggest benefit of this is that money will stay in your pocket as you  realize just how sales people and advertisers sell you products that you don't necessarily need. Here are several techniques that work on a subconscious level.\n1. Use framing to influence thought.: “The glass is half empty.” That’s how a pessimist would \"frame\" the objective fact of a half a glass of water. Framing is simply a way to alter how we will sort, categorize, associate and ultimately give meaning to events, objects or behaviors.\n\nThe headline “FBI agents Surround Cult Leader’s Compound” creates a mental picture vastly different than “FBI agents Raid Small Christian Gathering of Women and Children.” Both headlines might be accurate but the words used alter the associated internal images and feelings and thereby change or alter the meaning that a person will give to the objective events.\nFraming is frequently used by skillful politicians. For instance, politicians on both sides of the abortion debate cite their positions as \"pro-life or pro-choice\" because \"pro\" has better connotations than \"anti.\" Framing subtly uses emotionally charged words to shift people towards your point of view.\nTo frame a persuasive argument, select words that conjure images (positive, negative or neutral) in the minds of your audience. Even with other words nearby, a single framing word can still be effective.\nAnother example is illustrated by the difference between saying \"Having a cell phone will keep me out of trouble\" and \"Having a cell phone will keep me safe\". Ponder which word is more effective for your message: \"trouble\" or \"safe\".\n2. Use the mirroring technique.: Mirroring is the practice of mimicking the movements and body language of the person you are trying to persuade. By acting as the person listening does, you create a sense of empathy.\n\nYou can mirror hand gestures, leaning forward or away, or various head and arm movements. We all do this subconsciously, and if you pay attention you'll probably notice yourself doing it.\nBe subtle about it and delay 2-4 seconds between the other person's movement and your mirroring. Mirroring is also known as \"the chameleon effect\".\n3. Promote the scarcity of something.: Scarcity is frequently used by advertisers to make opportunities seem more appealing because they have limited availability. The assumption is that if a product is scarce, there must be a ton of demand for it! (Buy one now because they're selling out fast).\nBe aware that this is a technique of persuasion to which you are frequently exposed and take it into account when you make your purchase decision.\n4. Use reciprocation to create an obligation.: When someone does something for us, we feel compelled to return the favor. So, if you want someone to do something nice for you, why not do something nice for them first?\n\nIn a business setting, maybe you pass them a lead.\nAt home, you might offer to lend your lawnmower to a neighbor.\nIt doesn't matter where or when you do it, the key is to complement the relationship.\n5. Use timing to your advantage.: People are more likely to be agreeable and submissive when they're mentally fatigued. Before you ask someone for something they might not readily agree to, consider waiting until they've just done something mentally taxing. This could be at the end of the work day when you catch a co-worker on their way out the door. Whatever you ask, a likely response is, \"I'll take care of it tomorrow.\"\n6. Use congruence to obtain a wanted outcome.: We all try, subconsciously, to be consistent with previous actions. A technique used by salespeople is to shake your hand as he is negotiating with you. In most people's minds, a handshake equates to a closed deal, and by doing this before the deal actually closed, the salesperson is more likely to actually close it.\nA good way to use this yourself is to get people acting before they make up their minds. For example, if you were out and about with a friend and you wanted to go see a movie but the friend was undecided, you could start walking in the direction of the theatre while they are considering it. Your friend is more likely to agree to go once he or she is walking in the direction you set.\n7. Use fluid speech.: When we talk, we often use little interjections and hesitant phrases such as \"ummm\" or \"I mean\" and of course there is the ubiquitous \"like\". These little conversation fillers have the unintended effect of making us seem less confident and sure of ourselves, and thus less persuasive. If you're confident in your speech, others will be more easily persuaded by what you have to say.\n8. Use herd behavior to influence a decision.: We constantly observe to those around us to determine our actions; we have the need for acceptance. We are far more likely to follow or be persuaded by someone we like or by someone who we see as an authority.\n\nAn effective way to use this to your advantage is to be seen as a leader -- even if you don't have the official title.\nBe charming and  confident and people will place greater weight on your opinion.\nIf you're dealing with someone who isn't likely to see you as an authority (such as a superior in the workplace, or your significant other's parent) you can still take advantage of herd behavior.\n\nCasually praise a leader who that person admires.\nBy triggering positive thoughts in that person's mind about a person they look up to, they'll be more likely to associate those qualities with you.\n9. Get or borrow a Man's best friend.: To give people the impression that you're loyal, and to inspire them to be loyal to you, put up a picture of you with a dog (it doesn't even have to be your own dog). This can make you seem like a team player, but don't go overboard; putting up too many pictures can make you seem unprofessional.\n10. Offer a drink.: Give the person who you're persuading a warm drink (tea, coffee, hot cocoa) to hold while you're talking to them. The warm sensation of the drink in their hands (and their body) can subconsciously make them feel like you're an emotionally warm, likable and welcoming person. Giving them a cold drink can have the opposite effect! In general, people tend to feel cold and crave warm food or drinks when they're feeling socially isolated, so fill that need in order to make them more receptive.\n11. Ask \"Yes\" Questions.: Begin the conversation with questions that generate a \"Yes\" response. \"Nice day today, isn't?\" \"You're looking for a great deal on a car, aren't you?\"\n\nOnce you get someone saying yes, it's easy to get them to continue, up to and including \"Yes, I'll buy it.\"\nThe best counter to this is to make non-committal answers, but make sure your wife knows WHY you don't think she looks all that nice today.\n12. Break the touch barrier.: Whether you're closing a deal or asking someone on a date, touching them (in a subtle and appropriate way) can improve your chances by subconsciously activating the human desire to bond.\n\nIn a professional it is usually best to 'touch\" someone verbally by offering reassurance or praise as a physical touch can be interpreted as sexual harassment.\nIn romantic situations, any soft touch from a woman will usually be taken well; men will require  further reading in order to avoid making a woman feel uncomfortable.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Please provide an overview of the Eric Braverman missing person case.", "output": "Twitter users have started the hashtag #WheresEric in reference to Eric Braverman, the former CEO of the Clinton Foundation, because some think he has been a possible missing person since before the November 2016 U.S. election. Braverman’s last public activity, accessible via the internet, was an October 12 retweet.\nA common understanding of the events surrounding Braverman’s possible disappearance centers around his abrupt resignation from the Clinton Foundation in January 2015, which many thought was caused by his discovery of internal corruption at the non-profit organization. Braverman named was CEO in July 2013 during the immediate aftermath of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State which ended February 2013.\nA popular Youtube channel run by a man named George Webb has been tracking Braverman’s story and features daily video updates. Webb thinks Braverman has been missing since October 24, which was two days after it became public knowledge that he was suspected of being a traitor to the Clinton Foundation.\nHillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta thought Eric Braverman was the source of information leaks to the media, according to a leaked email sent March 8, 2015, which was published on October 22 of this year by WikiLeaks. This email was one week after a March 1 POLITICO article which detailed his struggle against the tenured Clinton staff, titled “Eric Braverman Tried to Change the Clinton Foundation. Then He Quit.” The article was described as “Not a pretty read” and forwarded to Podesta less than 24 hours after it was published.\nWhile these events occurred in 2015, many believe that the ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation may be a factor in Eric Braverman’s lack of public activity. The Podesta email releases by WikiLeaks came at the height of campaign season in October, and featured proof of many theories related to Hillary Clinton’s corruption that occurred during the tenure of Braverman at the Clinton Foundation.\nThe Benghazi scandal unraveled during that time, leading up to Clinton’s testimony before Congress and the subsequent investigations. Near the end of 2014, the discovery of Clinton’s private email server began to cause problems and eventually broke into public view in March 2015, right after Braverman’s resignation.\nOne of the most damaging emails revealed what has been called a “pay to play” mechanism, where the Clintons sold influence with the U.S. government to wealthy foreign interests. In January 2015, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and John Podesta discussed a problem related to the deal Hillary Clinton made with the King of Morocco for $12 million.\nAugust 2014 emails revealed Clinton sent Podesta a memo that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were funding ISIS. While it is clear that Clinton would have known about the Saudi and Qatari links to Islamic State, it is not confirmed if Clinton wrote the memo herself.\nThe New York Times admitted in April 2015 that untold millions flowed to the Clinton Foundation after a series of deals allowed uranium mining rights to be transferred to Russian state-owned interests. The Russian takeover of the conglomerate Uranium One was approved during Clinton’s tenure at the State Department despite national security concerns which should have prompted more scrutiny. The full scope of the scandal was being discovered late in Eric Braverman’s tenure at the Clinton Foundation.\nOne independent media outlet claimed to have made attempts to contact Braverman by phone and email, both of which were unsuccessful. The same organization claimed to receive no response after contacting Yale University officials about Braverman, who has taught courses on government and policy in the law school and other departments.\nBraverman is still listed on Yale’s website for Spring 2017 classes in the School of Management and the law school. The Free Thought Project was not able to reach Yale University for comment before publishing this report due to the holiday season.\nThe Free Thought Project spoke with Nathan Williams, the Managing Director of Public Relations at the Yale School of Management, who commented “we have nothing further to add to your story” and referred us to the University’s main Public Affairs office. He repeatedly stated he had no comment to specific questions regarding the completion of Braverman’s Fall 2016 courses or the expectation of beginning the Spring 2017 courses.

Packing horizontally means the things at the bottom are hard to get to.

What you need to aim for is a balance between weight and organisation.

It also will be part of Burger King’s two-for-$5 menu. Close \n  \n Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW) is putting its Yumbo ham-and-cheese sandwich back on the menu after a 40-year hiatus, aiming to entice customers with a taste from its past. \n  \n The Yumbo, which debuted in 1968 and was officially retired in 1974, will cost $3.69 and be available for a limited time, the Miami-based company said today in a statement. It also will be part of Burger King’s two-for-$5 menu. \n  \n Burger King has had success with the reintroduction of chicken fries earlier this year and is trying to boost sales by adding simpler menu items that are easy for workers to prepare. Customers have been asking about the Yumbo for years, and Burger King decided it was time to bring the sandwich back, said Eric Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer for North America. \n  \n “It got to the point where it’s one of those things we can no longer ignore,” he said. \n  \n Burger King didn’t specify how long the Yumbo will be on the menu at its approximately 7,360 North American restaurants. \n  \n The burger chain reported stronger-than-projected same-store sales last month, posting a third-quarter gain of 3.6 percent for the U.S. and Canada. Analysts had estimated a 2.5 percent increase. Burger King also is planning to acquire Canada’s Tim Hortons Inc. in a bid to become the world’s third-largest fast-food company. \n  \n To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.net \n  \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net Kevin Orland ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — Burger King said bringing back its \"Chicken Fries\" helped sales jump in the U.S. and Canada by the biggest amount in two years. \n  \n FILE - This Wednesday, June 20, 2012 photo shows a burger and fries at a Burger King in Richardson, Texas. Burger King reports quarterly financial results Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2014. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) (Associated Press) \n  \n The Miami-based chain said Tuesday that global sales rose 2.4 percent at established locations during the third quarter, including a 3.6 percent increase in the U.S. and Canada. McDonald's previously reported a 3.3 percent decline in the U.S. for the same time, citing heightened competition. \n  \n Alex Macedo, Burger King's president of North American operation, said in a phone interview that the chain's strategy of focusing on fewer, \"more impactful\" new menu items is paying off. \n  \n Burger King had announced in August it was bringing back Chicken Fries for a limited time in response to \"ongoing guest outcries reached a point where they could no longer be ignored.\" The offering — which are deep-fried pieces of chicken in the shape of french fries — had been introduced in 2005 and taken off the menu in 2012. \n  \n The return of the Chicken Fries is among the many marketing pushes Burger King has made since investment firm 3G Capital took the chain public again in 2012. Some efforts have flopped; the chain recently said this summer that most its franchisees would take its lower-calories \"Satisfries\" off the menu after less than a year. \n  \n To boost its profits, Burger King has also refranchised company-owned restaurants in the U.S. and has been striking deals with local operators to open more stores around the world. It currently has nearly 14,000 locations globally. \n  \n After factoring one-time charges primarily related to its purchase of Tim Hortons, Burger King Worldwide Inc. lost $23.5 million, or 7 cents per share. Adjusted earnings were 27 cents per share, in line with Wall Street expectations. Burger King said this summer it would buy the Canadian chain for about $11 billion, creating the world's third-largest fast-food company. \n  \n Total revenue rose to $278.9 million, short of the $281.8 million Wall Street expected. \n  \n Shares of Burger King fell 4 percent to $31. |||||\"\nIn this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

{"input": "What is Alex Azar's record on drug pricing?", "output": "His record suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Monday that his nominee for HHS secretary, Alex Azar will “be a star for … lower drug prices!” But the record of the former top executive for Eli Lilly, which tripled the price of a top-selling insulin drug while he led its U.S. operation, suggests a different story.\nLilly is one of three drug companies targeted by a class-action lawsuit that accuses the company, then under Azar’s watch, of exploiting the drug pricing system to ensure higher profit for insulin and has been fined in Mexico for colluding on the pricing of the drug .\nAzar, who spent almost a decade at Eli Lilly, rising to become president of the drug giant’s U.S. operations before leaving earlier this year, doesn’t deny drug costs are a consumer issue. But his record there and as a top official in George W. Bush’s administration suggests he’s unlikely to push pricing policies that would hit pharmaceutical companies’ pocketbooks.\nIn recent years, Azar has defended pricing practices, and argued against the approaches to reduce costs to consumer s as Trump endorsed during his campaign, such as allowing the government to negotiate drug prices and importing medicines from oversees.\nInstead, Azar has followed the pharma messaging playbook on drug pricing — deflecting attention to other parts of the health system, and even other countries, blaming them for the high drug costs paid by U.S. patients. He’s also justified drug prices as the cost of innovation.\nTrump’s focus on drug pricing in announcing Azar’s nomination didn’t win over doubters, who no longer believe he is serious about going after the industry he once slammed as “getting away with murder.” But it will make it easier for critics to pounce on what will likely be the toughest barrier for Azar to overcome during his confirmation process in the Senate.\nSen. Bernie Sanders said Monday he will “vigorously oppose” the nomination of Azar.\n“During Mr. Azar’s tenure at Eli Lilly, this multi billion-dollar corporation dodged taxes while charging Americans outrageously high prices for life saving prescription drugs,” Sanders said.\nSanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings commenced an investigation into Eli Lilly’s rising prices for insulin last year, spurring attorneys generals in Washington and New Mexico to look into the matter. The lawmakers questioned why the prices of the diabetes medicine whose main patent expired 75 years ago have seen huge jumps in recent years, with competitors often raising prices in tandem. One of Eli Lilly’s insulins, Humulin R U-500, rose 325 percent in price from 2010 to 2015.\nCummings tweeted that picking Azar is “like a fox guarding the hen house,” and a “slap in the face,” to Americans waiting for action on lower drug prices.\nAzar contends the outrage over drug pricing “erupted because we have seen a complete fundamental restructuring of health insurance,” with a shift to high-deductible plans that puts the burden of drug costs on employees and individuals, he said at a conference in May.\nWhile Azar makes a valid point, changing insurance policies without addressing drugmakers’ markups of existing drug prices, or high launch prices for new medicines, “is avoiding the elephant in the room.” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies drug prices at Harvard Medical School.\nEven Azar acknowledged in his speech that if insurance companies reduced consumers’ out of pocket charges for medicines, those costs would show up elsewhere, likely in premium increases.\nAzar has also attacked government regulators and payers for devaluing pharmaceutical innovation, suggesting that if the U.S. cuts pharma profits, it will see decreased investment in new drugs and fewer new cures.\n“The narrow focus of costs of medicine to the exclusion of innovation would be self-defeating in the long run,” Azar said in a 2014 speech.\nSarpatwari worries such views will lead Azar to promote the idea that making it quicker and easier for drug makers to introduce new medicines will reduce pharmaceutical costs. Researchers have found that drug companies don’t price their products any cheaper when FDA lets them use the accelerated approval process or other tactics to speed drugs to market. Former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf recently said that despite claims by the Trump administration that faster drug approvals lead to lower cost drugs, there is no direction relationship between the cost of development and price of drugs.\nNonetheless, in June, Azar told Fox Business that getting more new drugs to market to increase competition among brands would help bring U.S. prices down. Yet there’s only one example the drug industry can point to in the U.S. where brand competition has led to lower prices — and many where competitors simply raise prices in tandem. For example, Democrats recently launched a probe into the rising price of multiple sclerosis drugs where drugs introduced decades ago have raised prices to match their newer competitors.\nAnd while Azar expresses support for competition, one of the major factors keeping generic versions of insulin off the market have been drug company tactics known as evergreening — making incremental tweaks to their insulin versions or the devices that deliver it, to extend their monopolies for decades.\nAn article published in The Lancet in late 2015 found that most of the recent innovation in the insulin market has centered on improvements in delivery devices, blocking generics by agents that are indirectly related to the drug.\nAzar has also opposed other ideas to encourage competitive drug pricing. He’s spoken out against studies known as comparative effectiveness research, used to determine which drugs are most cost-effective for treating patients with a disease. He argues that all options should be available since different patients may need different medicines. The problem however, is that if payers must make all drugs available, they have little leverage to negotiate lower drug prices with industry.\nThe result is that despite Trump’s tweets praising Azar as a champion for lower costs , few fighting for lower drug prices are pinning their hopes on action by Azar.\n“This nominee has impeccable big pharma credentials but non-existent credentials when it comes to concerns on drug prices,” said Peter Welch, co-chair of the House Democrats Drug Pricing Task Force.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Thousands of mothers in every state in America have signed up to join the march in person or online where they are. Public gatherings to view the march are being organized in several states.\n…Mom’s March for America isn’t a physical march walking down the street, shouting, and carrying signs. It is a cultural march toward a higher standard of decency, civility, and liberty.\n“The Mom’s March isn’t about politics, parties, or presidents,” says Kimberly Fletcher, “it’s about standing for, and promoting, the principles and values America was founded on—the principles and values that made us the freest, most prosperous nation on earth.\nDawn Wildman, Director of the Coalition for Policy Reform, will be at a viewing event in San Diego.

Increased return rates should act as a deterrent to irregular migration,\" notes the document.\nLeaked by London-based civil liberties group Statewatch, the draft conclusions are to be discussed at a home affairs ministerial in Luxembourg on Thursday (8 October).\nMinisters want the European Commission to come up with new legislative proposals, if necessary, on how to speed up the process.\nThousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other countries are arriving on a daily basis in the EU. The past few weeks have seen EU leaders and ministers attempt to cobble together a coordinated response.\nThe EU already has a law on returns but it is not being applied. The Commission has threatened to take member states to court on the matter.\nUp to 500,000 people in the EU are ordered to leave every year but only around 40 percent are sent back.\nThe return bottleneck is due to either the lack of readmission agreements with countries outside the EU or because the agreements are not being respected. The EU has 17 readmission agreements.\nThe draft gives the Commission six months to come up with tailor-made solutions for more effective readmission with each. It says a \"balance of incentives and pressure\" should be used to make sure the countries stick to the rules.\nThe document notes \"all tools shall be mobilised to increase cooperation on return and readmission\".\nFor states in Africa, the document notes that people can be returned even without a readmission agreement.\nA 15-year-old treaty between the EU and Africa, Caribbean and Pacific group of states – known as the Cotonou Agreement – contains an article that \"commits all participating states to readmit their own nationals without further formalities\".\nMinisters also want national authorities to issue special \"EU laissez-passer\" documents to all unwanted asylum seekers and refugees.\n\"The idea that returns can be fast-tracked through issuing EU laissez-passer to return refugees to third countries is reminiscent of the apartheid pass laws\", said Statewatch director Tony Bunyan.\nThey want the return system promoted and broader cooperation with states where people are leaving from to enter the EU.\nThis includes connecting all EU-funded networks and programmes like EURINT (European integrated approach on return towards third countries), ERIN (European reintegration instrument network), EURLO (European return liaison officers), EMLOs (European migration liaison officers), ILOs (Immigration liaison officers) and the EU's border agency Frontex.\nThe European Commission, for its part, said in early September the networks need to \"deploy mobile task forces\" to help issue the travel documents.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What are some tips to get unstuck?", "output": "1. Sometimes, just powering through isn’t a great solution. If you find yourself hung up on a problem or task for longer than 15 minutes, step away and work on something unrelated for a while to mentally reboot. When you return, you'll feel more creative and ready to take on the challenge.\nFor example, if you’re putting together a tedious spreadsheet and the numbers start swimming before your eyes, switch gears and work on something else. Return some emails, file some paperwork, or reorganize your desk.\n2. Setting aside one continuous block of time to complete a task or project can be unproductive, especially if you need to be creative or find a solution to a problem. Instead, try to schedule multiple blocks of time over the span of several days to get it done. That way, you can mentally reboot in between sessions of intense focus.\nFor example, if you’re working on a presentation, don’t cram all of your work into a single day! Schedule blocks of time over the course of a few days and chip away at the work slowly but surely.\n3. If you’ve fallen behind on a project or you’re just having trouble getting started on a big task, it helps to break it into smaller tasks that feel more doable. Make a list of each task to help you get organized and then start chipping away at it, one task at a time. When you complete something, check it off and move on to the next task.\n\nFor example, if your boss asks you to write a position manual for your department, break the task down into smaller tasks that aren’t so overwhelming.\nAn example task list:\n\nResearch and note-taking\nCreate the outline\nWrite the introduction\nWrite chapters 1-3\nComplete chapters 4-6\nReview and revise\n4. Working in the same surroundings every day gets dull and repetitive. A change of scenery can kickstart those creative juices and get you going again! If you usually work in an office, try working outdoors or at a local coffee shop. If you can't leave your office or work space, work in the conference room for a few hours or switch to a different desk temporarily. Other options:\n\nWork at a standing desk if you typically sit\nMove your office furniture around\nAdd a plant to your desk to brighten your space\nSit on a balance ball instead of a desk chair for a few hours\n5. You always want to turn in good work, but being a stickler for perfection can drag you down into an unproductive space where you’re just spinning your wheels. Focus on giving the project your best effort rather than chasing a false idea of perfection. Do your best in the amount of time you have and wrap it up. Tomorrow is another day.\nFor example, if your boss wants your report on their desk by the end of the day, don’t toil into the night until you get it absolutely perfect. Do the best you can in the time that you have and turn it in on time.\n6. Even a short break to get some fresh air can help you refocus. Get up, walk away from your desk, and do something completely unrelated to work. Go for a walk, meet a friend for lunch, or sit in the sun for a few minutes and relax your mind. Don’t look at any screens or check in on social media during this time. You can also:\n\nCall in sick for a day to focus on self-care\n\nSet aside time to doodle or daydream to give your mind a break\nTake a short nap to refresh yourself\n7. If you can't seem to shake off the stuck feeling no matter what you do, you may be burned out completely. Listen to what your gut is telling you. It might not be an easy or fast option, but you can always change jobs or career paths if you want to. You might consider:\n\nGoing back to school\nSwitching positions within the same company\nLooking for other jobs that you're qualified for\nStarting your own business\n8. It’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of memories, especially if you’ve experienced a trauma or you’re grieving a deep loss. Try to keep in mind that you can't undo the past. At some point, you have to accept what happened so you can move forward and find peace. You deserve to have peace and happiness in your life.\n\nFor example, if you’re blaming yourself for a mistake you made, forgive yourself. Remind yourself every day that you're human and you aren't perfect. No one is! Continuing to blame yourself won't result in growth or change.\n\nIf you’re feeling regret, accept that you can't change what happened.\nIf you’re always thinking “what if,” try applying that to the future instead of the past. What if...you allowed yourself to move on?\nForgive people who’ve angered or mistreated so you can move forward.\n9. Tuning in to your five senses—sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing—is an easy way to connect to the present. It requires no tools and you can do it anywhere! If you’re stuck in a cycle of thoughts or feelings, force yourself to switch gears and notice the world around you. Clock every detail that you see.\n\nGaze up at the sky. What color is it? Are there clouds?\nListen to the sound of leaves rustling in the wind.\nRun your fingers through your cat’s soft fur.\nSavor a piece of dark chocolate.\nBreathe in the scent of pine trees in your backyard.\n10. Find a quiet place to sit or stand. Then, inhale for a count of 7 through your nose, hold for 7 counts, and exhale through your mouth as you count to 7. Try to do this simple breathing exercise at least 7 times in a row. Once you feel relaxed and your mind isn’t cycling negative thoughts, go ahead and stop.\nYou can do this anywhere, anytime, and as many times per day as you’d like.\n11. Change is uncomfortable, so be ready for that feeling and try to lean into it. Start with little changes in your daily life so that you don't get overwhelmed. Keep in mind that even small changes accumulate—over time, they can make a substantial impact in your life. Once you get used to small changes, work your way up to bigger stuff. Try things like:\n\nChanging up your daily routine\nMoving furniture or redecorating your home\nTalking to someone new on your commute\nTrying a new hobby\n\nTaking a class on something that interests you\nGoing to the gym twice a week\n12. Your life purpose is the thing that makes you feel most alive in this world. It’s what you feel passionate about and are willing to fight for. Perhaps you thought you knew your purpose, but it doesn’t inspire you anymore. That doesn’t mean you have no purpose! You have to find your new purpose. Ask yourself questions like:\n\nWhat activities do I look forward to the most?\nWho inspires me the most, and why?\nWhat am I skilled at?\nWhat makes me feel good about myself?\nWhat activity makes me lose track of time?\nYou can also read self-help books, listen to inspiring podcasts, watch or listen to Ted talks, and anything else that moves you.\n13. Unhealthy thought patterns can be difficult to change on your own. A therapist or mental health professional can help you figure out why you’re stuck and help you learn healthy ways to get unstuck. Therapy is a safe and confidential space where you can share thoughts and process things that you’ve been through. \n\nKeep in mind that feeling stuck or hopeless can be a symptom of depression. A therapist can help you with that.\nAsking for help isn’t weak. Sometimes it’s one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you know how can I get rid of bacne?", "output": "Oh, great! Another pimple—said no one ever. Acne isn’t just limited to your face and can actually pop up on other parts of your body, including your back. If you’re dealing with acne on your back, a.k.a. bacne, you may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed showing your skin. Fortunately, there are things you can do to clear up your bacne and keep it from coming back.\n1. It’ll make it easier for you to reach and scrub your back.: One of the most difficult parts of cleaning your back is reaching it! Use a scrub brush with a handle and gently scrub your entire back whenever you shower or bathe to remove dirt and excess oil from your pores, which can help keep it clean and clear up any bacne you’re dealing with.\nDon’t scrub your back too hard or you could irritate your skin.\n2. Use an emollient foam wash daily to kill acne-causing bacteria.: A benzoyl peroxide emollient foam wash is a specially designed body wash that will unclog the pores on your back and clear out any bacteria that could potentially cause acne. Add some to your scrubbing brush when you bathe and scrub your back well with it to help control bacne and reduce flare-ups.\n\nYou can find a benzoyl peroxide emollient foam wash at your local pharmacy or department store.\nA few popular emollient foam wash brands include Panoxyl, GOJO, and Cetaphil.\n3. It also works to unclog pores and destroy acne-causing bacteria.: A salicylic acid cleanser penetrates deep into your pores and dissolves dead skin-cell buildup. Apply some cleanser to your scrubbing brush and scrub the skin on your back well whenever you bathe to help get rid of bacne.\nSome people may react differently to benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, so choose whichever one works best for you and doesn’t cause any skin irritation.\n4. You can rinse it off after to prevent bleached fabrics.: No matter what cleanser you use, allow it to sit on your skin for 3-4 minutes after you apply it so it has plenty of time to kill acne-causing bacteria. Then, rinse your back entirely to prevent potential skin irritation and to avoid possibly staining or discoloring your towels and clothing.\nWaiting a few minutes allows the cleanser to soak deeper into your pores, which can both help treat and prevent bacne.\n5. Choose a scrub that will remove oil, dead skin, and grime.: Look for one that combines a chemical exfoliator, like lactic acid and a physical exfoliator, such as micro-dermabrasion granules. Gently massage the scrub into your damp skin just before you shower 2-3 times a week to help prevent breakouts.\nIf your skin is irritated, stop using a scrub and allow it to heal.\n6. Remove trapped dirt and oil from your pores.: Choose cleansing pads saturated with salicylic acid to help fight breakouts. Wipe your back in between showers to clean your skin and treat any existing bacne you may have.\nIf you have trouble reaching your back with the cleansing pads, try asking a friend to help you!\n7. Use an acne mask to treat bacne before it gets worse.: If you only have a few pimples, you can target them directly to knock them out. Choose a skincare mask that contains ingredients such as sulfur, camphor, salicylic acid, and tea tree oil. Apply the mask directly to the affected area according to the directions on the packaging.\nYou may need a friend to help apply the mask if you can’t reach your bacne.\n8. You can go to a dermatologist or use an over-the-counter option.: A chemical peel is a procedure that removes the outermost layers of your skin and can be an effective way to treat bacne quickly. For the best results, make an appointment with a licensed dermatologist. But you can use OTC chemical peels as well. Just follow the directions on the packaging carefully when you apply the chemical peel to avoid injuring or irritating your skin.\n9. They can help boost your skin’s health and fight off bacne.: Fermented foods such as kimchi, yogurt, miso, and kefir are chock full of probiotics, which can really improve the health of your skin’s biome. If your skin is healthy, it can fight off bacne and keep it from coming back.\nYou can also take probiotic supplements to add more to your diet.\n10. Materials like cotton or moisture-wicking items can help prevent bacne.: Tight or non-breathable clothing can actually trap sweat, oil, and bacteria inside your pores. It can also cause friction that can further irritate your hair follicles. To avoid getting bacne, swap out your clothes for looser materials that allow your skin to breathe.\n11. Rinse or towel off after a workout or if you’ve been sweating.: Sweat can clog your pores and make your bacne worse. Whenever you work up a good sweat, take a quick shower to rinse it off. If you can’t bathe, at least wipe your skin with a clean cloth to dry it off so you aren’t soaking in your sweat for too long.\nYou can also change clothes if you worked up a good sweat so you aren’t leaving sweat on your skin for too long.\n12. It can cause scars and could lead to an infection.: It may be tempting to pick at your bacne, but you can actually make the problem worse. You could introduce additional bacteria that could lead to a more serious problem such as an infection. Use cleansing products and allow your body to fight off the acne on its own.\nPopping pimples on your back can also be really painful and irritate your skin.\n13. If you can’t get rid of it on your own, see a professional.: If you’ve tried everything, but nothing seems to be working, make an appointment to see a dermatologist or ask your doctor for a referral. They may be able to recommend treatments or prescribe stronger medication that can help get rid of your bacne.\nFor instance, your doctor may prescribe an acne medication such as Accutane, which can help treat serious cases of bacne.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What can you tell me about the benefits of silence?", "output": "We live in a loud and distracting world, where silence is increasingly difficult to come by -- and that may be negatively affecting our health.\nIn fact, a 2011 World Health Organization report called noise pollution a \"modern plague,\" concluding that \"there is overwhelming evidence that exposure to environmental noise has adverse effects on the health of the population.\"\nWe're constantly filling our ears with music, TV and radio news, podcasts and, of course, the multitude of sounds that we create nonstop in our own heads. Think about it: How many moments each day do you spend in total silence? The answer is probably very few.\nAs our internal and external environments become louder and louder, more people are beginning to seek out silence, whether through a practice of sitting quietly for 10 minutes every morning or heading off to a 10-day silent retreat.\nInspired to go find some peace and quiet? Here are four science-backed ways that silence is good for your brain -- and how making time for it can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative.\n1. Silence relieves stress and tension.\nFlorence Nightingale, the 19th century British nurse and social activist, once wrote that “Unnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care that can be inflicted on sick or well.” Nightgale argued that needless sounds could cause distress, sleep loss and alarm for recovering patients.\nIt turns out that noise pollution has been found to lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks, as well as impairing hearing and overall health. Loud noises raise stress levels by activating the brain's amygdala and causing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, according to research.\nAn unpublished 2004 paper by environmental psychologist Dr. Craig Zimring suggests that higher noise levels in neonatal intensive care units led to elevated blood pressure, increased heart rates and disrupted patient sleep patterns.\nJust as too much noise can cause stress and tension, research has found that silence has the opposite effect, releasing tension in the brain and body.\nA 2006 study published in the journal Heart found two minutes of silence to be more relaxing than listening to \"relaxing\" music, based on changes in blood pressure and blood circulation in the brain.\n2. Silence replenishes our mental resources.\nIn our everyday lives, sensory input is being thrown at us from every angle. When we can finally get away from these sonic disruptions, our brains' attention centers have the opportunity to restore themselves.\nThe ceaseless attentional demands of modern life put a significant burden on the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is involved in high-order thinking, decision-making and problem-solving.\nAs a result, our attentional resources become drained. When those attention resources are depleted, we become distracted and mentally fatigued, and may struggle to focus, solve problems and come up with new ideas.\nBut according to attention restoration theory, the brain can restore its finite cognitive resources when we're in environments with lower levels of sensory input than usual. In silence -- for instance, the quiet stillness you find when walking alone in nature -- the brain can let down its sensory guard, so to speak.\n3. In silence, we can tap into the brain's default mode network.\nThe default mode network of the brain is activated when we engage in what scientists refer to as \"self-generated cognition,\" such as daydreaming, meditating, fantasizing about the future or just letting our minds wander.\nWhen the brain is idle and disengaged from external stimuli, we can finally tap into our inner stream of thoughts, emotions, memories and ideas. Engaging this network helps us to make meaning out of our experiences, empathize with others, be more creative and reflect on our own mental and emotional states.\nIn order to do this, it's necessary to break away from the distractions that keep us lingering on the shallow surfaces of the mind. Silence is one way of getting there.\nDefault mode activity helps us think deeply and creatively. As Herman Melville once wrote, \"All profound things and emotions of things are preceded and attended by silence.\"\n4. Getting quiet can regenerate brain cells.\nSilence can quite literally grow the brain.\nA 2013 study on mice, published in the journal Brain, Structure, and Function, involved comparing the effects of ambient noise, white noise, pup calls and silence on the rodents' brains. Although the researchers intended to use silence as a control in the study, they found that two hours of silence daily led to the development of new cells in the hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory and emotion.\nWhile preliminary, the findings suggested that silence could be therapeutic for conditions like depression and Alzheimer's, which are associated with decreased rates of neuron regeneration in the hippocampus.\nAre You Living Your Eulogy or Resume?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Give your opinion on the Oakland Raiders drafting Josh Jackson to fill the holes in their secondary. Respond in 572 words.", "output": "Coming into the 2018 NFL draft, some of the biggest needs the Oakland Raiders must address are on defense. More specifically, however, it’s the holes in the secondary that need immediate attention.\nOakland has since cut cornerback David Amerson and fellow corner Sean Smith is still dealing with legal troubles and T.J. Carrie is currently listed as a free agent. The Raiders have loads of untapped potential in last year’s rookie Gareon Conley but after an injury-plagued season, there is no question he needs a consistent running mate moving forward. Enter, Josh Jackson.\nThe former Iowa Hawkeye standout has the necessary skills to provide an immediate lift to a secondary that ranked No. 24 in passing yards allowed last season. Much to the dismay of Raider Nation, Oakland’s defense couldn’t manage a single interception till a Week 12 matchup versus the Paxton Lynch led Broncos.\nYou can now help support The Raider Ramble, check out some of our new merchandise!\nJackson, however, has excellent ball skills as he tallied 27 passes defended and nabbed eight interceptions in his junior season. Jackson stands in at 6-foot-1 and has long arms to help get his hands on most passes thrown in his direction. Opposing passers completed a mere 41.3 percent of passes when throwing towards Jackson and he was able to make a play on the ball on 25.7 percent of his targets per NFL.com.\nOne of Jackson’s strong suits is the ability to high point the ball and win 50/50 balls. A trait Oakland could garner from as the team deals with a myriad of talented receiving threats in the AFC West. When it comes to the big stage, that is where Jackson shines. In Iowa’s upset victory over Ohio State, Jackson was a vacuum for the football as he intercepted three passes and returned two for touchdowns. Jackson’s coverage skills were on full display throughout the season and after Week 4, he didn’t allow a single touchdown, effectively shutting down one side of the field.\nOn the flip side for Jackson, he does possess weaknesses as well. Although one of his strengths is his aggressiveness and anticipation, Jackson can rely too heavily on his instinctive play and be fooled by route fakes at the line of scrimmage. There is also concerns with the inexperience of Jackson as he only has 14 career starts for the Hawkeyes.\nUltimately, if Jackson is available when the Raiders are on the clock in the first round, general manager Reggie McKenzie should be taking a long look at this stud corner from Iowa. Jackson may not be the most polished cornerback, albeit he has the size and length that NFL defensive coordinators drool over and opposing quarterbacks have nightmares about. Pairing Josh Jackson with Gareon Conley would create an exciting young cornerback duo that Raider Nation has been longing to see.\nI like Josh Jackson but not at either 9th or 10th pick overall. If we traded down to like 15th or 16th pick and got him and another draft pick, i would love the move. I think Denzel Ward is a better corner prospect at the 9th/10th pick but if he is gone i think we could trade down and pick him up later in the draft. Plus, i think that we need to stop drafting corners in the first round. Big Reg doesn’t have a good track record of secondary players in the 1st round…….", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Story: Todd Jensen recently inherited the old Jensen family home. He and his wife, Anne, were busy with repairs and remodeling. It was a wonderful inheritance, as the home, built in 1910, was surprisingly modern in design. So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well … Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen. Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.” Charlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue. Todd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.” Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.” In which room was great-grandfather murdered?", "output": "Charlene looked into her empty cup and began to speak. “The murder was not in Anita’s room. She was locked in for the duration of the argument and killing. It was not in Harry’s room, either. An empty room would contain no chair for Earl to be found slumped over in. The same goes for the master bedroom – it contained a stool for great-grandmother, but no chair. Edward’s room would not still have bloody carpet on the floor in 1983 from a 1925 murder – no matter how hard you would try to clean it up, you would not keep it for over half a century. So, it had to be the bathroom, where there was a chair available to place great-grandfather and nothing but tile and enamel on the floor and walls. It would have been very easy to clean any kind of spill, blood included, in that bathroom.”\n\nPortion of a letter dated May 25, 1925 by Mildred Jensen:\n\nYesterday I hired a man to paper the dining room. I told him I wanted to paste this letter on the wall and paper over it, as a time capsule for future generations. He thought that was a nice idea and enthusiastically agreed to do as I requested.\n\nHe would be shocked if he knew what I am about to say, as would other family members (not to mention the police). Simply put, our son Edward murdered his father after a violent argument. Edward got a young girl pregnant and his father threatened to disown him. Edward stabbed him in the neck with a hunting knife. They were arguing in the upstairs hall and Earl slapped Edward. Edward lost all reason, went to his room to retrieve his knife, came back to the hall and pushed his father into the bathroom where he stabbed him. Fortunately for Edward – and the family’s reputation – Earl bled to death on the tile floor where it was easy to clean up.\n\nOur family was prominent – very prominent – in those days. It did not take much to convince our family doctor to state that Earl died of natural causes – a heart attack when becoming unduly agitated with our son.\n\nI saw the argument and Earl’s murder with my own terrified eyes. I could not bring myself to turn in Edward or to put our family through two messy scandals.\n\nStill, my wish is that somebody, someday, will know the truth through this letter.\n\nEarl Jensen was murdered by his own son in the upstairs bathroom. Edward and I cleaned his body, put fresh clothes on him and placed the body in a chair by the sink, making it look like he had gone into the “reading room” to remove his clothes and prepare for bed. We covered the knife wound with makeup. Doc Hartley, when he saw the body, asked no questions (quite possibly because he did not want to).", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

(Nasdaq: SPLS) today gave an update on the investigation into its previously announced data security incident involving a small percentage of its retail point-of-sale systems.\nStaples’ data security experts detected that criminals deployed malware to some point-of-sale systems at 115 of its more than 1,400 U.S. retail stores. Upon detection, Staples immediately took action to eradicate the malware in mid-September and to further enhance its security. Staples also retained outside data security experts to investigate the incident and has worked closely with payment card companies and law enforcement on this matter.\nBased on its investigation, Staples believes that malware may have allowed access to some transaction data at affected stores, including cardholder names, payment card numbers, expiration dates, and card verification codes. At 113 stores, the malware may have allowed access to this data for purchases made from August 10, 2014 through September 16, 2014. At two stores, the malware may have allowed access to data from purchases made from July 20, 2014 through September 16, 2014.\nAs a result, and in light of Staples’ commitment to protecting its customers, Staples is offering free identity protection services, including credit monitoring, identity theft insurance, and a free credit report, to customers who used a payment card at any of the affected stores during the relevant time periods. Additional information about the incident, including dates of potential access and how to sign up for free credit monitoring, can be found at http://staples.newshq.businesswire.com/statement.\nDuring the investigation Staples also received reports of fraudulent payment card use related to four stores in Manhattan, New York at various times from April through September 2014. The investigation found no malware or suspicious activity related to the payment systems at those stores. However, out of an abundance of caution, Staples is offering free identity protection services, including credit monitoring, identity theft insurance, and a free credit report, to customers who used their payment cards at those stores during specific time periods.\nOverall, the company believes that approximately 1.16 million payment cards may have been affected. Specific stores and dates can be found here.\nTypically, customers are not responsible for any fraudulent charges on their credit cards that are reported in a timely fashion. Staples customers who shopped at the affected stores during the relevant time periods should review their account statements and notify their card issuers of any suspicious activity.\nStaples is committed to protecting customer data and regrets any inconvenience caused by this incident. Staples has taken steps to enhance the security of its point-of-sale systems, including the use of new encryption tools.\nStaples makes it easy to make more happen with more products and more ways to shop. Through its world-class retail, online and delivery capabilities, Staples lets customers shop however and whenever they want, whether it’s in-store, online, on mobile devices, or through the company’s innovative buy online, pick-up in store option. Staples offers more products than ever, such as technology, facilities and breakroom supplies, furniture, safety supplies, medical supplies, and Copy and Print services.

{"input": "What are the 17 fundamental steps to consider when attempting to remove acrylic nails?", "output": "1. Use nail clippers to  trim the tips of your acrylic nails short.: Cut off as much of the acrylic as you can—the more you can cut off now, the easier the rest of the process will be. If cutting is difficult due to the thickness of the nails, use a coarse nail file to file them. Make sure you don't cut any of your nail bed.\n2. File the topcoat and nail polish off of your nails.: Use a fine-grade buffer or a nail file to remove as much product as possible. Use long strokes that run the length of the nail, and keep  filing until the product is removed or the smooth, shiny layer gives way to a more matte surface.\n\nClipping your nails will help the acetone dissolve the acrylics more easily.\nThis may take some time, depending on the size of your nails and how much product is on them, so sit tight and persevere.\nTake care not to file or damage your natural nail as you do this.\n3. Soak 10 cotton balls in acetone.: Fill a medium glass bowl halfway with acetone. Then, drop 10 cotton balls into the acetone, making sure each is completely saturated.\nAcetone is highly flammable and produces potent fumes. Make sure the room is well ventilated, and keep the acetone away from heat or sources of flames.\n4. Cut out 10 squares of foil that are 5 in × 5 in (13 cm × 13 cm).: While the cotton balls soak, cut out 10 squares of tinfoil. Make each square large enough to wrap completely around your finger. They don’t have to be neat!\n5. Apply petroleum jelly to the skin surrounding your nails.: Acetone is hard on skin, so it's important to protect your fingers. Rub a generous amount of petroleum jelly on the tips of your fingers and the cuticles–even up to the first knuckle, if you’re feeling especially cautious. Be careful not to apply the petroleum jelly to the nails themselves, which may hinder removal.\nUse a cotton-tipped wooden applicator if you need help applying the petroleum jelly more precisely.\n6. Secure the cotton balls to your fingers with tin foil.: Place a cotton ball in the center of a tin foil square, then place the 2 together on top of a nail, with the cotton ball touching the nail. Then, wrap the tin foil around your nail to secure the cotton ball. Repeat this for each nail.\n\nYou can use a non-plastic tape to fasten the cotton balls if you don't have aluminum foil–acetone will dissolve plastic tape!\nYou can also simply soak your nails in a bowl of acetone for 30 minutes if you know that acetone doesn't irritate your skin.\n7. Take the foil bundles off your nails after 30 minutes.: Unwrap the tinfoil and gently but firmly pull the cotton ball and acrylic away from your natural nail. The acetone has loosened the acrylic from your nail, and the acrylic nail will come away without much fuss.\n\nIf you soaked your acrylic nails in the bowl of acetone, gently pry the nails off using an orange wood stick.\nIf the acrylic nails are still firmly stuck, repeat the process and let your nails soak for another 20 minutes and attempt to remove them again.\n8. Sand off the leftover acrylic and shape your nails with the nail filer.: The acrylic will be soft from the acetone bath, so take the opportunity to buff the rest of it away, until there’s no more residue left on your nails. Then, use nail clippers and a nail file to smooth the sharp edges and round out your nails. After,  buff your nails lightly with a fine-grade nail buffer, moving from the base of the nail to the tip, to give them a nice, smooth sheen.\n\nIf the acrylic begins to harden again while you're buffing, use a cotton ball soaked in acetone to dampen it.\nTo avoid damaging your nails, file in one direction only, and avoid using a back-and-forth sawing motion.\nThe top few layers of your nails may have been removed with the acrylic. Buff and file gently so as not to tear or damage them further when file and buff them.\n9. Wash your hands and apply lotion to moisturize them.: Acetone can cause skin to become extremely dry, so restore a little moisture to your fingers. Wash your hands with warm water and mild hand soap. Then, dry your hands and rub them with body oil or a moisturizing lotion. Rub the moisturizer into your nails, cuticles, and skin to keep them hydrated and to  help them recover from the acrylics.\n10. Pry up the bottom edge of an acrylic nail with a floss pick.: Use a floss pick or a cuticle stick to gently lift the edge of the nail closest to your cuticle. Insert the pick between the acrylic nail and your natural nail, and loosen as much of the acrylic nail as possible.\n\nWhen using this method, work slowly and carefully. Removing acrylic nails without chemical assistance (like acetone) may cause damage to your nails.\nSoak your nails in acetone using the acetone method for easier removal with dental floss.\n11. Slide the floss under the loosened edge until the nail comes off.: Use the floss end of the pick, and slowly and gently move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. As you work, apply slight pressure in the direction away from your cuticle in order to work the floss along the underside of the acrylic nail. Continue this way until the acrylic nail comes off, and repeat the process for each nail.\n\nUse another finger to hold the base of the nail in place so that it doesn’t wiggle uncomfortably as you floss it away.\nYou can also use standard floss, but you may need a partner to help you.\n12. Buff your nails and apply Argan oil to restore them.: Use a buffer to clean up your natural nails and remove any acrylic residue. Then, apply Argan oil, cuticle cream, or moisturizer in order to strengthen your nails.\n13. Clip the acrylic nails as short as possible with a nail clipper.: Use the edge of the clipper to cut into the edge of the nail. Cut as close to your natural nail as possible, and then work your way across the acrylic nail until the tip of the nail is removed.\nIn many cases, the acrylic nail will snap off as soon as you make your first cut with the nail clipper.\n14. File away the top coat and polish with the electric filer.: Set your electric nail filer to about 12,000 rpm (rotations per minute). Then, carefully lower the filing bit to the base of the nail, just below the cuticle. Graze the filer across the surface of the nail, so that a thin layer of polish, color, or whatever product is applied to the nail is sanded away. Continue to do this, following the contour of the nail.\nMove the filer in one direction–towards you–as opposed to moving it back and forth across the nail.\n15. Use light, rapid back-and-forth motions to remove the acrylic.: Once you’ve filed away all the product applied to the acrylic nail, begin to make swift, gentle, brushstroke-like movement across the surface of the nail to remove as much acrylic as possible. When you begin to see the natural nail beneath, reduce the filer’s rpm to about 7,000, and continue to remove as much acrylic as possible.\n\nOnce the nail is suitably thin, clip the excess acrylic off the tip of the nail.\nIf at any time you become uncomfortable using the electric filer, opt to use the acetone method to soak off the rest of the nail. It’ll be much easier with much of the acrylic removed already.\n16. Use a manual filer to remove the rest of the acrylic.: Once the bulk of the acrylic has been removed, set the electric filer aside, and use a hand-filer to remove the rest. Use rapid, back-and-forth movement across the entire surface of the nail, until the acrylic has been completely removed and your natural nail is entirely exposed.\n17. Wash and moisturize your hands.: Wash your hands with warm water and mild hand soap to remove any dust or residue. Then, dry your hands thoroughly and apply body oil, argan oil or a moisturizing lotion. Rub the moisturizer into your nails, cuticles, and skin to keep them hydrated.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Describe Donald Trump's record on improving the economy.", "output": "Donald Trump has not made the economy great again.\nDonald Trump is convinced that he has done wonders for the economy. The president is especially proud of the surging stock market, which he crowed about Friday morning on Twitter.\nBut if you look beyond the frothy heights of the Dow and S&P 500, there’s little sign that Trump has accomplished much. Yes, he’s presiding over a gradual, fairly steady expansion left over from the Obama years. And he hasn’t tanked the economy, like some feared he might. But there’s little proof he’s done anything special to significantly boost it.\nThis isn’t a dig at Trump’s record, exactly. Aside from rare exceptions, like passing a massive stimulus bill in the middle of a recession, there typically isn’t much a president can do to dramatically alter the course of the economy on a year-to-year basisi. But it’s worth keeping in mind that Trump’s tenure has been fairly ho hum the next time someone claims he really is making the economy great again.\nStart with the labor market. On Friday, the government reported that U.S. employers added 148,000 workers to their payrolls in December. That figure will be revised a couple of times. But for now, it’s a shrug-worthy number capping off an unremarkable year of job growth. Overall, the country added 171,000 new jobs a month in 2017, down from 187,000 in 2016 and 226,000 a month in 2015. It’s not as if things sped up towards the end of the year, either, as Trump settled into the White House.\nSome of this slight slowdown is to be expected. Unemployment is low, at 4.1 percent. And the closer the U.S. gets to full employment, the fewer jobs we need to create in order keep everyone who wants to work employed. The point is, there hasn’t been some sort of dramatic hiring surge under Trump. We’re just seeing more of the same.\nMeanwhile, the tightening labor market still isn’t leading to much faster wage growth. Average hourly earnings for all workers rose 2.5 percent in 2017, compared to almost 2.9 percent in 2016. Once you take inflation (last recorded for November) into account, average pay has barely jumped at all.\nThere are other signs of lingering softness in the labor market, too. The employment rate for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is still a good deal below its pre-recession peak. It’s rising, but it seems like some Americans who should be working are still on the sidelines.\nIn short, job growth is trucking along unremarkably and wage growth has actually slowed at a time when we’re still digging our way out of the crater left behind by 2008. A golden era this is not.\nWhat about the blue collar jobs Trump promised to bring back? On the one hand, the U.S. did add 71,000 more manufacturing jobs this year than last. But it added 62,000 fewer construction jobs. Does this have anything whatsoever to do with the president’s regulatory pruning and tax-cutting? Who knows. But it’s not exactly boom times for hard hats.\nThis seems to be an overstatement at best. While it’s true that business investment has picked up the pace this year, much of that has been due to rising oil prices, which have led drillers to restart their rigs after shuttering them during the crude crash of 2015 and 2016. As economist Dean Baker notes, at least 43 percent of this year’s increase in business investment has come from the oil and gas industry—which the Bureau of Economic Analysis labels under the category “mining exploration, shafts, and wells.” Without all that oil drilling, investment has been good, but not necessarily something to write a sweeping article about. (Also, it’s worth noting that investment would have looked a lot strong under Obama if oil hadn’t been such a drag).\nThat brings us back to the Dow. While Trump surely isn’t responsible for every point that stock indexes have tacked on during his presidency—we’re in the middle of a long runup in global asset prices that’s been supported by loose central bank policies—I do think he probably deserves some credit. Corporations will be more profitable thanks to the massive tax cuts. Investors don’t have to worry about any big new regulations that might slow down business. It’s a recipe for high share prices.\nObviously, it’s a bit early to tell what the full effects of Trump’s economic policies have been. We don’t even have GDP data for all of 2017 yet. The big tax cut just passed, and might yield a bit more investment by businesses. But as of now, there’s just no sign that Trump has delivered any kind of dramatic change. Donald Trump inherited a pretty good economy. Unlike the rest of his presidency, he’s managed not to muck it up.\n*Correction, Jan. 5, 2017: This post originally implied that the 84 percent of all stocks owned by the top 10 percent of U.S. households did not include retirement accounts such as 401Ks.

{"input": "Could you please explain how to implement Dependency Injection pattern using Dagger 2?", "output": "The main purpose of Dependency Injection pattern which is implemented by Dagger 2 is that DI separates the creation of a client’s dependencies from the client’s behavior. In practice it means that all calls of new operator, newInstance() and others shouldn’t be invoked in places other than Dagger’s Modules.\nThe purpose of this post is to show what we can do, not what we should do. That’s why it’s important to know what we give in return for separating creation from behavior. If you want to use Dagger 2 for almost everything in your project you will quickly see that big piece of 64k methods count limit is used by generated code for injections.\nAnd with this approach we act against DI and profits given by it. Calling Adapter constructor inside Activity class means that every time when we need to change something in its implementation (new constructor argument, maybe completely new implementation which shows grid instead of list), we have to update Activity code.\nSometimes taking a shortcut like this is intended (we know that this code won’t be extended more in the future). But today we’ll try to make all adapter related code a part of dependency injection approach. As an example we’ll extend our GithubClient app - its screen which shows list of repositories for given username.\nTo make it more complex and closer to real apps our Adapter will have three different view types: normal, extended and featured.\nHere you can see starting code base for our example. For me this is how the first iteration of implemented Adapter looks like in most cases.\nIt’s not as straightforward as in previous example. As you can see our ViewHolders have mandatory argument which is View object (RecyclerView.ViewHolder class has only one constructor: public ViewHolder(View itemView)). It means that every time when we want to create new object, we need to provide view (which is created during runtime so we cannot configure this in advance in Module classes).\nThis problem is known as an Assisted Injection and was wider described on StackOverflow and Dagger Discuss group.\nFinal solution (until there is no official way of doing this in Dagger 2 framework) is to inject Factory object which takes those dependencies as an arguments and creates intended object. In mentioned StackOverflow thread you can see how to do this by hand, but also Google provides us a solution to generate those factories automatically.\nNow our code is a bit cleaner but still we call constructors inside it.\nFinal step in our refactoring is to initialize our Factory objects in Module class to get rid of constructors calls in Adapter class. We can simply inject them as a RepositoriesListAdapter constructor parameters. But it would mean that every time when we decide to add/remove new type of ViewHolder we still would need to update Adapter code by hand.\nInstead we can make use from Multibinding. Thanks to this feature Dagger allows us to bind several objects into a collection (even when the objects are bound in different modules).\nNo constructors, no if-else statements. Everything is done by proper Dagger graph configuration.\nAnd that’s all - our adapter and its ViewHolders are now a part of Dagger 2 graph. We are another step closer to inject everything in our code. With AutoFactory and Multibinding it will be much simpler.\nFull source code of described project GithubClient is available on Github repository.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)?", "output": "Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder that’s characterized by extreme perfectionism, order, and neatness. People with OCPD will also feel a severe need to impose their own standards on their outside environment.\nThey find it hard to express their feelings.\nThey have difficulty forming and maintaining close relationships with others.\nThey’re hardworking, but their obsession with perfection can make them inefficient.\nThey often feel righteous, indignant, and angry.\nThey often face social isolation.\nThey can experience anxiety that occurs with depression.\nOCPD is often confused with an anxiety disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, they aren’t the same.\nPeople with OCPD have no idea that there’s anything wrong with the way they think or behave. They believe that their way of thinking and doing things is the only correct way and that everyone else is wrong.\nWhat are the causes of OCPD?\nThe exact cause of OCPD is unknown. Like many aspects of OCPD, the causes have yet to be determined. OCPD may be caused by a combination of genetics and childhood experiences.\nIn some case studies, adults can recall experiencing OCPD from a very early age. They may have felt that they needed to be a perfect or perfectly obedient child. This need to follow the rules then carries over into adulthood.\nWho is most at risk for OCPD?\nThe International OCD Foundation (OCDF) approximates that men are twice as likely as women to be diagnosed with this personality disorder. According to the , between 2 and 7 percent of the population has OCPD, making it the most prevalent personality disorder.\nThose with existing mental health diagnoses are more likely to be diagnosed with OCPD. More research is needed to demonstrate the role that OCPD plays in these diagnoses.\nAdditionally, those with severe OCD are more likely to be diagnosed with OCPD.\nWhat are the symptoms of OCPD?\nOCPD is diagnosed when symptoms impair your ability to function and interact with others.\nWhat’s the most important thing I can do for someone with OCPD?\nThe most important thing you can do is recognize that the behavior that someone with OCPD exhibits is part of their personality, which is an enduring characteristic of the psychological makeup of that person. Before clashing with them over the way they want something done (or if you see that they have redone something that they asked you to do because they feel that your work doesn’t meet their unique standards), be certain to ask yourself “is this issue important enough to me to argue or fight with them over it?” Also, if you find that they prefer to do something themselves, don’t take it personally. Recognize that this trait is part of who they are and remember that it’s not a negative reflection on you.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of mental health counseling. During CBT, you meet with a mental health professional on a structured schedule. These regular sessions involve working with your counselor to talk through any anxiety, stress, or depression. A mental health counselor may encourage you to put less emphasis on work and more emphasis on recreation, family, and other interpersonal relationships.\nYour doctor may consider prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to decrease some anxiety surrounding the obsessive-compulsive cycle. If you’re prescribed an SSRI, you may also benefit from support groups and regular treatment from a psychiatrist. Long-term prescription use isn’t usually recommended for OCPD.\nRelaxation training involves specific breathing and relaxation techniques that can help decrease your sense of stress and urgency. These symptoms are common in OCPD. Examples of recommended relaxation practices include yoga, tai chi, and Pilates.\nThe outlook for someone with OCPD may be better than the outlook for other personality disorders. Treatment can help give you greater awareness of how the symptoms of OCPD can adversely affect others. If you have OCPD, you may be less likely to become addicted to drugs or alcohol, which is common with other personality disorders.\nAs with other personality disorders, finding the treatment that works for you is the foundation of success. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help improve your ability to interact and empathize with your loved ones.\nHow can a spouse or loved one support someone with OCPD?\nPeople with OCPD are typically reluctant to change their behaviors. They often see others as the problem instead.\nMost individuals that get treatment for OCPD are encouraged to do so by a spouse or loved one. However, it can be very difficult to approach someone with OCPD about their behaviors. It can also be helpful for significant others and loved ones of people with OCPD to seek support for themselves.\nThere are multiple forums and support groups that a spouse or loved one of someone with OCPD can join. The International OCD Foundation keeps a list of support groups for those coping with OCD, OCD tendencies, and personality disorders such as OCPD.\nFind information on personality disorder types, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.\nPeople with perfectionism hold themselves to impossibly high standards.

{"input": "How can I develop my business's mobile app using a cross-platform framework?", "output": "Are you thinking about developing your business presence on Mobile? And looking for a team of dedicated mobile developers. In this article, we will give you a walk through on why Xamarin framework is the best for your mobile development needs. Xamarin is the latest tech tool for startup businesses everywhere that need a cross-platform mobile app.\nCross-platform mobile refers to the development of mobile apps that work on multiple mobile platforms. For example, a cross-platform mobile application runs easily on different mobile operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows, BlackBerry. There are many Cross-platform frameworks that exist such as Qt, Xamarin, Phonegap, Ionic, React Native to support cross-platform development. In this post below, We are going to talk about Xamarin in particular and the reasons to use Xamarin for cross-platform development.\nXamarin is a cross-platform framework for mobile app development that brings .NET and C# to both Android and iOS platforms. Xamarin is amazing in the sense that it is full .NET based and is able to produce true Android and iOS mobile apps concurrently.\nWikipedia defines Xamarin as: Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned San Francisco, California based software company founded in May 2011 by the engineers that created Mono, Mono for Android and MonoTouch that are cross-platform implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and Common Language Specifications (often called Microsoft.NET).\nMost cost and time-efficient cross-platform framework for mobile app development.\nIf you have not tried Xamarin yet, you are missing a great deal on the latest tech enabler in the industry. With Xamarin framework, we can cover all major mobile platforms like Android, iOS and Windows without diluting the quality and performance as a rule.\nXamarin has two methods for building cross platform mobile applications: Xamarin Forms – You can use Xamarin.Forms when you want to design your app one time which will be shared across all platforms with some minor code changes. Xamarin Native – You can use native when you want to design separate applications for each platform with a help of Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Windows.\nXamarin Native has a large variety of UI and third party components library. Xamarin Forms has little third party components library.\nXamarin Native supports Non-Portable .NET Libraries Xamarin Forms does not support some of the third party component libraries.\nXamarin Native apps are better suited for large quantity of data and it is also effective for frequent data update. Xamarin Forms apps are not ideal for large quantity of data and not effective for frequent data update.\nXamarin is an excellent powerful platform that supports Cross-platform mobile development at a fractional cost. Xamarin Cross Platform Development has gained massive popularity during the recent years. Xamarin platform makes a significant savings in development time, maintenance and overall client costs. Apart from these benefits, Xamarin apps also deliver a great performance and user experience. To find out whether or not Xamarin is the right platform for you, let’s have a quick conversation with our mobile development consultants. We build complete solutions, not just a collection of features. If you want to leverage the advantages of Xamarin to transform your startup business, drop a mail to us, and we will get in touch with you.

{"input": "Team using Waiting for Release column on their kanban board\n\nMy team is using Kanban board but they seem to prefer to collate a couple of tickets then 'do a release' as appose to releasing each ticket. i.e. they move tickets through the workflow and then put them in a waiting column for days on end and then they do sporadic releases.\nThis obviously seems sub-optimal but then again its just another queue column so maybe its not the end of the world. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions about this and also any guidelines about the WIP of this queue column 'Waiting for release'", "output": "It is not clear if your team is doing production support or software/ app dev.  Assuming it is app dev, there are a few questions to consider - \n\nWhat is the customer's need for the releases your team is making?  If there is no pressure from customer to do a release or if the pressure is sporadic or infrequent, then there is nothing much your team can do about it.  However, over longer periods of time, across multiple customers, if your team is - or becomes - challenged with having to maintain multiple versions of your product, there is a cost to that.  It is then up to them - or some business function like sales or support - to have the conversation with your customers that they need to accept new releases at a certain frequency or they may be at a risk of not getting the support they might need on an old version of the product.\nIs there an internal stakeholder - such as Product Owner or Sales or Management - who anyway needs to see what work the team has competed - and done so satisfactorily - at least from a quality and market requirements perspective? If yes, it might be worthwhile for them to deploy new or updated code to an internal staging/ demo server so they can do demos to your stakeholders - or let them get their hands dirty and help validate the new/ updated features of the product.\n\nIf it is a production support environment, there may be some SLA (service level agreement) goals to be met (response time, resolution time, etc.) - which would again need some pre-defined frequency of releases in order to meet those SLAs. Again, without more information, it would appear your team is not facing SLA violation issues and unhappy customers.\nBased on these, there certainly are guidelines for you to follow about how to model your Kanban board so it matches your current business processes - and helps you improve, as Daniel pointed out above.\n\nWIP Limits are meant to encourage people to finish work at hand before taking up new stuff.  If these are not implemented, you might have a situation where half-done tickets lie around in intermediate in-progress or done stages waiting for some external dependency (customer input, shared resources, etc.) and the team, instead of resolving them, takes up new tickets.  Pretty soon, you can have a slow-moving Kanban board with low flow and throughput and high lead times.\nInstead of calling the last column \"waiting for release\", it could simply be better named - either \"Deployed to Staging\" or just \"Completed\" - so it is clear to everyone concerned that no more work is pending other than putting it out in a release.  \n\nHowever, just to be clear - Kanban is not prescriptive in nature - and it simply asks you to start with what you have - and look for improvement opportunities.  If your unpredictable release schedule is a (perceived) problem, it can be easily fixed by defining an explicit policy to do releases every 1, 2 or 4 or 6 weeks, whatever is acceptable in the business context. If it is not, and everyone knows what \"Waiting for Release\" means, there's no need to change anything!\nI'd like to share the example of our own Dev team (we are a Kanban product developer - SwiftKanban), which has a somewhat similar situation.  We have both SaaS and on-prem customers.  We do SaaS releases every 4-6 weeks - that cadence is well established. But, our on-prem customers may take new releases as late as once in 3 months only - and we have little control over that - it is really based on their own cost of deploying a new release from a vendor.  \nSo, we follow a process similar to what I described above - and this is what our Kanban board looks like - \n\nAs you might be able to tell, our internal staging server (just to the left of the green Production column) is Ganesha - and we deploy new features, bug-fixes and other enhancements on a fairly continuous basis.  This server is used as an \"internal production\" server where we run our company operations - such as Marketing, HR, etc.\nSo, cards sitting in the Ganesha column are cards that are done and deployed.  We have no WIP Limit here - but our policy is to deploy a new release to production when we have approximately 20 items completed.  All other columns on the board have WIP limits as needed - based on the number of people working on each stage.  \nLike I said, we deploy to our SaaS production regularly every 4-6 weeks.  Our customers can take up new releases every 1-3 months whenever they are ready.  So you could easily set a WIP limit on a similar column and use that limit to ensure that the team deploys to production when the WIP Limit has been reached.  It is really up to your team and your customers as to what makes sense!\nHope this helps.  ", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Spots fill up fast, so decide on a date as soon as you can. You can make a reservation for up to 11 people at a time with individual tours.\n5. To book a visit, fill out the form on CERN's website. You'll need to include your name, your email address, the country you live in, and your phone number. You'll also need to include the number of people in your party, as well as the date (and an alternative date) you'd like to visit.\nIf you are reserving spots for more than 11 people, you'll need to reserve a group tour. You can make a reservation for up to 48 people, using the form on the website.\n6. School tours are generally half a day, and you can request a specific tour, though tours are dependent on what's available. Also, it's not likely you'll be able to visit the collider itself. On the other hand, school tours sometimes include performing experiments. You can even use provided materials to help get your students ready for the visit.\n\nOnly 12 to 48 people can visit at once, including teachers and students. The tours are free. In general, students must be 13 and older. H\nAny teacher can fill out the reservation form online. You'll need information like the number of people attending, contact information, your preferred language, and the preferred date.\n7. You cannot wear high heels or any type of sandal to visit CERN, so pay attention to your footwear. Sturdy, flat shoes are the best plan, though you can wear low heels that are squared off rather than pointed.\n8. CERN is in both France and Switzerland. While you're taking your tour, you might go across this border, so it's important to carry your passport with you. If you traveled from another country, inquire if you need a visa to visit either of these countries.\n9. Luggage isn't allowed on the premises at CERN, so you'll need to leave it behind. However, you can bring purses and other small handbags, as well as cameras. Small backpacks are also fine.\nPets should also be left behind.\n10. Some areas of CERN may not be accessible to you under certain conditions, so you need to let them know in advance of your tour. For instance, if you have limited mobility, are pregnant, or have a pacemaker, you may not be able to visit some areas. If you have a ferromagnetic implant, you also need to let them know. \nAlso contact them if you have anyone under 16 in your group.\n11. You will have a scheduled time for your tour, but you need to get there 20 minutes ahead of time. That way, you can get checked in and be ready to start your tour right on time. \nYou'll begin by visiting reception at 385 route de Meyrin, CH-1217 Meyrin - Geneva, Switzerland.\n12. While at CERN, try not to disturb those who are going about their jobs. Don't be too loud, and don't take pictures of them without permission. Also, listen to any safety instructions given by tour guides or guards. CERN also asks that you act respectfully in general while in the facility.\nSmoking is not allowed anywhere at CERN.\n13. Before or after your tour, you can also take a spin around CERN's permanent exhibits. The exhibits are free, and you can explore them by yourself. The two exhibits are Microcosm (which gives an overview of the experiments at CERN) and the Universe of Particles (which discusses particles and contemporary physics).\nThe permanent exhibits are both near reception.\n14. If you prefer, you can eat in CERN's cafeteria. It has many options to choose from, so everyone in your group should be happy. They only take cash, but if you find yourself without any on hand, ATMs are located just outside the cafeteria.\n15. To round off your day, spend some time in the souvenir shop. You can get a wide variety of souvenirs that are only available on site. With a souvenir in hand, you have proof that you visited CERN.\n\nIn the souvenir shop, you'll find things like pins, pencils, stickers, hoodies, hard hats, notebooks, umbrellas, and a wide variety of other paraphernalia.\nYou can use credit cards at the souvenir shop.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Please explain how the MDC and their actions in Zimbabwe lead to the positive economic figures seen in 2009-2013, even though external debt to GDP halved and the current account balance nearly quadrupled.", "output": "It was just a few years ago, when the MDC managed the country’s purse strings.\nHard as it may be to believe, Zimbabwe was once the freest economy in the world. Not in the dim, distant past, but just a few years ago. Between 2009 and 2012, the economy grew at 8% a year, albeit off a bombed-out base.\nZimbabwean Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentarian Eddie Cross, who is also an economist, says Zimbabwe’s brief experimentation with economic liberalism deserves far more attention from other countries in the region – including from Zimbabwe’s current rulers.\nThe miraculous turnaround happened between 2009 and 2013 when the MDC had control of the finance ministry, during a period when the ruling Zanu-PF was forced to share power with the MDC – an arrangement known as the Government of National Unity (GNU).\nIn 2009 then finance minister Tendai Biti stood up in parliament and in a 30-minute speech announced that he was lifting exchange controls and scrapping pricing and controls that had been implemented by the previous government. The result was an economic flowering the likes of which had not been seen before or since. “In that moment, Zimbabwe became the freest economy in the world,” says Cross in a recent article.\nShortages of fuel and food vanished and once-empty supermarkets were stacked to the roof. Where did the hundreds of millions of US dollars come from to make this possible? Inflation, which was doubling prices every few hours, fell to minus 7%. Zimbabwe’s inflation was the lowest in the SADC region over the period. Zimbabweans could scarcely recognise the country in which they were living. Entrepreneurs were making money hand over fist.\n“What did the GNU leadership do to make these dramatic changes? They simply gave Zimbabweans economic freedom,” says Cross.\nThis all came to an end in 2013 when Zanu-PF regained absolute control of the government and reverted to form with out-of-control spending and economic restrictions.\nPrior to 2009, Zimbabwe’s economy had been devastated with rampant money printing and a world-record annual inflation rate of 231 000 000%, reached in June 2008. This came to an abrupt end when the country adopted hard currencies such as the US dollar and rand as the primary means of exchange.\nThe results were immediate and dramatic, and government revenues shot through the roof.\nCross says there is a lesson here for all Africa countries: should SA follow the Zimbabwean model (indeed, should Zimbabwe follow its own example), a new era of economic prosperity would eventuate.\nCross told Moneyweb: “What authorities fear the most about relaxing exchange controls is that they will run out of foreign exchange. This is false, and Zimbabwe has proved it. We did away with exchange controls and prices stabilised. The great fear of running out of money to pay for imports was proven to be wrong. We had millions more dollars to pay for imports than we had before.\nUnder the GNU, entrepreneurs were free to import what they liked without restriction or the need for import licences.\nIt goes without saying that any discussion of Zimbabwe’s economy during the GNU recovery should be prefaced with a red label warning. A country analysis by the World Bank says the country’s GDP virtually halved between 2000 and 2008 due to a string of political and economic crises. This, says the bank, was “the sharpest contraction of its kind in a peacetime economy”, raising poverty rates to more than 72%, and leaving a fifth of the population in extreme poverty.\nUniversity of Zimbabwe economist Tony Hawkins pointed out that for all the positive outcomes of economic liberalisation, the country’s savings had been wiped out by hyperinflation and “dollarisation” of the economy. Since 2010, savings had turned negative. No country can grow without foreign investment – which has averaged around 17% of GDP between 2009 and 2015, well short of the 30% needed to create the millions of jobs the government has promised.\nReserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya noted in the bank’s 2013 annual report that economic activity had started to decelerate due to external shocks and concerns over the upcoming elections. The economic miracle was coming to an end. In a 2017 country report, the International Monetary Fund says Zimbabwe’s economy remained hidebound by a lack of structural reform and government spending that is crowding out the private sector.\nCross says President Emmerson Mnangagwa has started out by making all the right sounds “but has failed to change the situation on the ground where 95% of all Zimbabweans are. The messaging at Davos was designed for an elite audience and an impact was made, but that will not win him an election that is now just around the corner. That will be decided on real bread and butter issues.\nSome 70% of the new voters roll is under the age of 35, while the cabinet age is well over 60. Mnangagwa remains a minority figure in his party, having alienated and expelled many of the faithful. Zimbabwe could end up with a coalition government, though few in the MDC would embrace this with enthusiasm. Their memories of an obstructionist Zanu-PF during the GNU are still painfully fresh.\nWhoever rules after the June election, Cross says Zimbabweans want a return to the freedoms they enjoyed between 2009 and 2013. Exchange controls need to be taken away from the Reserve Bank and returned to the commercial banks, import restrictions must once again be abandoned, and a local currency free from political manipulation must be reintroduced.\nSounds impressive, but I do not understand one thing. The second chart shows the current account balance nearly quadrupling during this period while the external debt to GDP halving. How is this possible with 10% growth?\nOf all the people you quote “Eddy Cross” who has passed his sell by date. You writing to prop up the MDC.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Advice for carrying out the \"Stay in Bed\" technique with our 2-year-old\n\nMy two-year old has always had trouble settling and sleeping through the night, but recently the problem seems to have become an awful lot worse. It all came to a head one night a few weeks ago after he woke at midnight and didn't drop off again till 4am, despite our best efforts with the \"controlled crying\" technique. That was when we knew we had to do something proactively, and soon.\nAfter seeking advice from various different sources (including this forum), we opted to try Supernanny's \"Stay in Bed\" technique. She describes it in her book and there are various clips of it on the TV show (e.g. this clip~ 24 mins & 29mins ). She says it is the best approach for a child of his age. \nBasically it involves making sure your child has eaten and drunk well and carrying out a calming bed-time routine, putting your child in bed and sitting in the room with them, sitting side-on and without making eye-contact. The first time he gets out, you say \"It's bedtime.\" and put him back. The second time, you say \"Bedtime\". Any subsequent times, you say NOTHING- ignore the screams, the questions, the begging for food, drink, etc- just lift him up and put him back.\nIt's all very well. But I've been doing it for almost a week, and so far the number of times I have had to put him back to bed (in chronological order) have been: 40,23,21,4,8,18. Last night he woke at 3am and (despite me sitting silently in his room after he woke) would not settle till 5am.\nOn the TV show, the technique always works very quickly and effectively when done correctly. But as far as I can see, I have followed everything to the letter, and I certainly have not once said a word to him when I shouldn't. The only doubt I have is that sometimes I lie down, rather than sit when I come in after he's woken in the middle of the night (can you blame me?)- don't know if that's important.\nHas anyone got any advice on what I may be doing wrong, or maybe just some encouragement that it can take a long time?\nOne last point- I know there are loads of contrasting techniques out there, and I'm sure each has its merits. But I'd really rather stick with this technique now I've started, rather than start trying another one. Simply because changing it is distressing and confusing for him.\n\nA:\n\nMy wife and I never worried a whole lot about whether our daughter actually SLEPT after bedtime.\nOur rule was that after bedtime, she had to be quiet, leave us alone, and stay in her room. We enforced that rule just like any other, and allowed nature to manage her sleeping. We modeled the same behavior ... after bedtime the lights were lowered and the house quieted. We closed her door and turned our TV low if it was on at all.\nShe would read, play with dolls/animals, draw, whatever, as long as she was quiet and left us alone. And she would go to bed when she was sleepy.\nShe is almost 20 now, and the habit is still ingrained. She manages her sleep far better than I did when I was 20. Once the house has quieted down for the evening, she quiets down too. Even if she is up late doing school work, she is quiet and lets us alone.\n\nA:\n\nAs a note of encouragement, it sounds like the technique is working.  The number of times putting baby back to bed is decreasing, despite a rather difficult night. It looks like you have stuck with it for 6 nights.  I hope things continue improving tonight, but toddlers have their up and down nights, with any sleep or bedtime technique.  Toddlers can be stubborn, and so it may take longer for this to work than with infant sleep training and putting to bed.  I agree with others that giving this 2 full weeks, and then evaluating the improvement is best.\nAlso, with TV shows, there is a lot of editing!  The techniques may be great, and it sounds like this one is, but I don't believe that the technique even works for SuperNanny as easily as they make it look.  My roommate was on a \"reality\" buying you first house show, and it was all staged.  He had already bought the house before they started shooting, so they had him pretend to go through other houses like he was still hunting, change clothes and pretend to go appliance shopping (at the sponsor's store who actually gave him the appliances), and the pretend to decide to buy the house he'd already bought.  So, watch the shows for the tips, but don't believe you're doing something wrong if it's not as easy as it looks.", "output": "If he has transitioned to a toddler bed it is the only reason he needs to wake and get up. It is a major deal to little ones. It's different and offers a new exciting freedom. He will test the boundaries of that just like he will test the boundaries of everything else. \nKeep up the hard work! One week, while torturous, is not very long for a little one to adjust and get used to a major change. Some kids may only need a couple redirections back to bed but most will need several weeks to months. It is quite common to see a decrease in the undesired behavior and then a spike here and there. Sometimes a REALLY bad spike indicates the dance is about to end. An extinction burst happens when a child's undesired behavior has been ignored and redirected to the desired behavior and the child full heartedly resists( major spike in awakenings, tantruming, etc) Many people give up at this point but it is the most crucial time to stay consistent. Once you move through the burst, the new behavior will have replaced the old. ", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The western lowland gorilla is the most numerous species of western gorilla but is still considered to be critically endangered in the wild.\nThe western lowland gorilla is found inhabiting the tropical jungles and forests of western and central Africa, along with lowland swamps and secondary forests. The western lowland gorilla is found throughout Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon and is also the most likely gorilla to be seen in the world's zoos.\nThere are two separate sub-species of western gorilla which are the western lowland gorilla and the cross river gorilla. Although only slightly different in appearance, the two western gorilla species are distinguished by their differing skull and tooth sizes, and the cross river gorilla is also much rarer than the western lowland gorilla with only a handful thought to be left in the wild.\nThe western lowland gorilla is one of the great apes, a group that includes orang-utans, gorillas, humans and chimpanzees. As with the other great apes, the western lowland gorilla has a number of features which makes living in the jungle a bit easier, including having opposable thumbs which come in handy when the western lowland gorilla is peeling fruit.\nThe western lowland gorilla is an omnivorous animal, but the majority of it's diet is made up of eating fruit which the western lowland gorilla is known to travel vast distances through the forests to find. The western lowland gorilla also eats leaves, nuts and berries, along with insects and occasionally small animals such as lizards and rodents. The western lowland gorilla has also been observed using basic tools in the wild in order to more effectively gather food.\nDue to it's large size, the western lowland gorilla has few real predators in it's native African forests, with large cats such as leopards and the odd crocodile being the only real natural threat to the western lowland gorilla. The biggest threat to the western lowland gorilla is habitat loss caused by deforestation and also being hunted by humans. Parts of the western lowland gorilla's territory have also been taken over by civil unrest in recent years, which, along with poaching, has had a truly devastating affect on wild populations.\nThe western lowland gorilla tends to live in groups which are led and protected by the alpha male. The alpha male western lowland gorilla also mates with the females in his group, producing generally single offspring, known as babies. The western lowland gorilla babies remain with their mother until they are a few years old and become independent.\nToday, the western lowland gorilla is classified as one of the world's critically endangered species with an estimated 95,000 western lowland gorilla individuals thought to be left in the jungles of Africa.\nThe largest primate in the world!\nLess than 5,000 in the wild!\nIsolated populations found in the mountains!\n\"This was an excellent source that helped me during my research project!

{"input": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.\n\"Signs of aging have been partially reversed in mice, according to research led by scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The study indicates that rejuvenation, long considered science fiction, may one day become reality. \n  \n Mice genetically engineered to replicate progeria, a disease of accelerated aging, lived 30 percent longer after receiving the treatment. And normally aged mice experienced improvement in pancreatic and muscle function, along with better wound healing. \n  \n The results suggest that aging in humans may likewise be a plastic process that can be controlled, said noted stem cell scientist Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte, who led the study along with Salk Institute colleague Alejandro Ocampo. \n  \n The study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, is a proof of principle, the scientists cautioned. Years of research lie ahead before any therapy can be tried in people. The complete study can be found at j.mp/belmonteaging. \n  \n The researchers accomplished this feat in mice genetically engineered to make four proteins that reprogram adult cells to an embryonic-like state. \n  \n A decade ago, the Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka used these proteins -- Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc -- to make what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPS cells. These act very much like embryonic stem cells, but can be made from common adult cells such as those in skin. Pluripotent means the cells can become nearly any type of cell in the body. In 2012, Yamanaka shared a Nobel Prize for his work. \n  \n Two groups of mice were tested. One were mice that were normally aged to 12 months (most breeds of mice can naturally live to about 18 months to 2 years). \n  \n The second consisted of mice genetically engineered to model a fatal childhood disease, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. This disease is characterized by heart disease, joint stiffness, hair loss and other conditions generally experienced by older people. Those affected usually die before adulthood. \n  \n A full reprogramming would have been fatal to the mice, because the adult cells would have lost their function. However, the scientists engineered the mice to produce these “Yamanaka factors” only when given the antibiotic doxycycline, providing an on-off switch. \n  \n When the mice were exposed to the Yamanaka factors for two days a week, every week, they experienced changes in the DNA that removed some of the characteristic “epigenetic” marks of aging. These marks are chemical groups added to or removed from the core DNA molecule. These modifications or their removal turn genes off and on, but don’t change their underlying sequence. \n  \n Signs of safety \n  \n Izpisúa Belmonte said the improvement in the progeria model mice is notable because the treatment didn’t repair the mutation in the DNA, but only altered the epigenetic pattern of gene activation to more closely resemble that of younger cells. \n  \n Also notably, the animals didn’t develop tumors, a known risk with cellular reprogramming, said Pradeep Reddy, another Salk researcher and study co-author. \n  \n Izpisúa Belmonte said reprogramming works in discrete stages, so a brief exposure doesn’t erase the cells’ identity, but rolls them back to a more youthful state \n  \n “We know from in vitro studies that the factors need to be there for more time to induce full reprogramming,” he said. “So the cells never go back to a pluripotent state.” \n  \n Amy Firth, a stem cell researcher at the University of Southern California, said the work is “exciting.” \n  \n “I used to work at the Salk Institute as a postdoc, so I was very familiar with Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte’s research,” said Firth, assistant professor of medicine at the Eli and Edythe Broad CIRM Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC. “It’s great to see some new data.” \n  \n The study is solid, because the researchers approached the issue from several different avenues to demonstrate rejuvenation through the reprogramming factors, Firth said. \n  \n The researchers not only demonstrated rejuvenation in cells, but went to whole animals to demonstrate actual benefit, she said. \n  \n Kristin Baldwin, a stem cell scientist at The Scripps Research Institute, reacted similarly to Firth in describing the Salk team's feat. \n  \n \"It's an exciting, remarkable study, showing that you can in vivo tinker with the marks of aging a little bit ... so that you do seem to improve the function of the cells,\" said Baldwin, an investigator at TSRI's Dorris Neuroscience Center. \n  \n Baldwin said she and colleagues approached the aging problem from the opposite direction in a study published Dec. 12 in the journal Nature Biotechnology. It’s available at j.mp/ipsaging. \n  \n That study examined epigenetic markers of age in artificial embryonic stem cells. Called induced pluripotent stem cells, they are created from adult or \"somatic\" cells in the body, such as from skin and blood. These IPS cells act much like human embryonic stem cells, but weren’t derived from a human embryo. \n  \n Researchers in that study found the age markers were retained to varying degrees in IPS cells, suggesting they might not be fully restored to a youthful state. This means some of these cells might not be well suited for therapy, such as replacing a patient’s injured or diseased tissues. \n  \n Baldwin said the problems can be dealt with by careful screening of IPS cells. If one lineage of cells is unsuitable, scientists can create another set of cells, and continue until they find an acceptable line. \n  \n Other factors in aging \n  \n Aging involves other changes besides the epigenetic ones, Baldwin and Izpisúa Belmonte said. These include DNA damage from radiation or mutagenic chemicals, shortening of the protective chromosome ends called telomeres, and the accumulation of cellular debris. \n  \n What the study helps demonstrate is that a substantial amount of aging appears linked to these epigenetic changes, Izpisúa Belmonte said. \n  \n \"The caveat, which is what we showed in our study, is that they're not going to be able to reverse the somatic mutations that are accumulating during aging,\" Baldwin said. \"Nobody knows how much of those contribute to the negative effects of aging.” ||||| The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body’s cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock’s hands are always set back to zero at conception: However old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Ten years ago, the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka’s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. \n  \n Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. \n  \n But at the Salk Institute, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. The cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell, which is open to all fates, and an adult cell, which is committed to being a particular type of cell, before rebuilding the missing limb. \n  \n This partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process, and that a small dose of the Yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state. \n  \n With Alejandro Ocampo and other Salk researchers, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of Yamanaka factors to mice. The solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four Yamanaka genes, and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water, applied just two days a week. \n  \n The Salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely, so as to get quick results. “What we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging, healthier organs, and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. \n  \n Photo \n  \n The team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but, because the mice are still living, could not yet say if longevity was extended. \n  \n Dr. Izpisua Belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process. The clock is created by the epigenome, the system of proteins that clads the cell’s DNA and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n When an egg develops into a whole animal, the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell, say, activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells. This process lets the embryo’s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body. \n  \n The epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. \n  \n Only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging. If the epigenome is damaged, perhaps by accumulating too many marks, the cell’s efficiency is degraded. \n  \n Dr. Izpisua Belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited. “At the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them,” he said. \n  \n What the Yamanaka genes are doing in his mice, he believes, is eliminating the extra marks, thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state. \n  \n The Salk biologists “do indeed provide what I believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity,” Dr. Vijg said. \n  \n But he cautioned the fast-aging mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging. \n  \n Dr. Guarente said it was more likely that the Yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly, but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells. This gene activation is a natural function of the Yamanaka factors. It is these embryonic pro-health genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice, Dr. Guarente suggested, and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity. \n  \n Thomas A. Rando, an expert on stem cells and aging at Stanford, said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process, and that “if that’s what’s happening, this is the first demonstration of that.” \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the Yamanaka factors. The use of chemicals “will be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications,” he said. |||||\"", "output": "In the future, we may be able to treat aging itself, rather than just the diseases that come with it, the Guardian reports. “Our study shows that aging may not have to proceed in one single direction,\" researcher Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte says. \"With careful modulation, aging might be reversed.” According to the New York Times, the study—published Thursday in Cell—is science's first attempt at combating aging by rejiggering the genome. In the study, researchers genetically engineered mice to produce four proteins that revert cells back to their embryonic state, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. They then created an on/off switch for the proteins to keep cells from permanently reverting to their embryonic state and becoming useless. After six weeks of treatment, mice genetically engineered to have the rapid-aging disease progeria lived 30% longer. Mice without progeria had better functioning hearts, pancreases, and muscles, as well as improved healing of wounds, following treatment. Basically, they seemed younger. The study's results were described by outside experts as \"exciting\" and \"huge.\" While similar treatments for humans are likely at least a decade away, researchers believe they could be used to slow down the body's internal clock and control at least some aspects of aging.

The more placid South Korea appears, the more US troops look like the only real obstacle to unification.\nWestern media applaud Moon’s soft-line declarations, and they like it when the South Korean man in the street says he finds Trump scarier than Kim Jong Un. But there is a danger of Kim taking all these things the wrong way.\nYou’ve written that some South Koreans admire the North, or at least, feel a sense of shared identity. Why is that? And can this persist in the current climate?\nMany intellectuals here admire the North for standing up to the world. It’s a right-wing sort of admiration, really, for a resolute state that does what it says. More common than admiration are feelings of shared ethnic identity with the North. We are perhaps too blinkered by our own globalism to understand how natural they are.\nBut the average South Korean’s pan-Korean nationalism is rather shallow. Most people here want to see symbolic shows of reconciliation with the North – like a joint Olympic team in 2018 – but they don’t want unification, least of all under Kim Jong Un’s rule.\nAnd they want the US Army to stay here in case he gets the wrong idea. It’s understandable enough, but this crisis will soon force them to pick one side, and one side only. “No ally is better than one’s own race,” President Kim Young Sam (president of South Korea from 1993 to 1998) said, which no West German chancellor would have dreamed of saying.\nWhile the failures of the Vietnam War loom large, the US bungling of Korea is rarely discussed in “western media”. What’s the national memory of that war in both Koreas, and how is that impacting the current state of affairs?\nThat memory impacts the current situation less than one might think. Foreigners assume that because of the war, the two sides must dislike each other more than West and East Germans did. The opposite is the case. Some of my students say, “The North would never attack us, we’re the same people,” as if the war never happened. And North Korea would now be just as committed to unification if it hadn’t.\nYou mention the Vietnam War. In some ways that’s the more relevant and topical event right now. Kim Il Sung (leader of North Korea from its inception in 1948 until he died 1994, and the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un) was struck both by Washington’s decision not to use nukes on North Vietnam and by its general reluctance to go all out to win.\nI’m sure the ease with which bare-footed Vietcong marched into Saigon in 1975 now strengthens Pyongyang’s conviction that the “Yankee colony” will not last long after the colonisers pull out.\nIn South Korea, meanwhile, conservatives are now loudly invoking the story of South Vietnam’s demise. They say, “There too you had a richer, freer state, and it fell only a few years after US troops pulled out. Let’s not make the same mistake”. They point worriedly to President Moon Jae-in’s own remark that he felt “delight” when predictions of US defeat in Vietnam came true.\nHow likely is a war?\nI agree with those who say North Korea knows a nuclear war is unwinnable. I also think it fancies its chances of a peaceful takeover too highly to want to risk a premature invasion while US troops are here.\nOn the other hand, the North’s legitimacy derives almost wholly from its subjects’ perception of perfect strength and resolve. This makes it harder for Pyongyang to back down than it was for Moscow during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.\nAlso, the North’s ideology glorifies the heart over the mind, instincts over consciousness, which makes rash decisions more likely to be made, even quite low down the military command structure. There is therefore a significant danger of some sort of limited clash at any time. But that has always been the case.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Uhmazing puts a spotlight on everyday people with amazing talent, great personality, and absolute dedication to their craft. It’s so intense … you can’t take it. When kudos is not enough … it’s Uhmazing!\nHere … comes … Robbie!!!\nYass!!! Finally! Universe … I present to you (drum roll) … THE one and only … Robbie Turner! (crash cymbals) (focus spotlight) (standing ovation) (applause) (fangirling) (weep on your knees) (throw tips).\nThe fabulous Robbie Turner is one of Seattle’s top notch drag entertainer. It is an understatement, I know. She is a certified triple quintuple sextuple threat (clean your mind, it’s not that!); she can sing, act, dance, host, I bet you … sew!, and do comedy. Oh, and it’s all second nature. No big deal, just oozing with talent … (shrugs) yah. And she’s got the shows to prove it too! Yes, that’s right … “shows”, plural. She is a very polished queen in so many ways … attitude, look, style, and shtick.\nTangent time: I didn’t know who is Robbie Turner until that fateful night on March 16, 2013 9:13PM PST. (“dream” wavy effect) (echoing narration) I went to R Place in Seattle, WA that warm Saturday night to attend the club’s MARCH DRAGNESS event which featured performances by an All Star Lashes cast and headlined by RuPaul’s Drag Race (RPDR) Season Five star, Detox Icunt. I printed my VIP ticket years before, lol only days … many days before, and I wanted to make sure I get the best seat … second row and window seat, – for safety and easy viewing (who wants to watch a drag show straight-on anyway? Rookies. It’s not a movie, you will want to see their best profile and contouring … at three quarters! But I digress.). So I dragged my companion to the club forty five minutes before the doors opened to do reconnaissance and terrain assessment, lol. It’s war! It got packed, fast! Drama ensued. Anyway, Lashes cast and guest performers did their thing one after the other … there where ten performances excluding Detox’s. The performances were all fantastic, and nobody broke a leg. Anyway, Robbie Turner (or “RT” for this piece) caught my attention. It’s not that she was painted for the gawds or that she did an amazing Liza Minnelli performance … no, not those. It’s her shtick and the subtle nuances that she makes. I learned later on that it’s her “trademark” to jump onto unsuspecting male audience members (or security staff), hump their neck, and/or drag them to the stage and make them join her in an impromptu dance routine that involves lifting her, spinning her, carrying her around, and/or miming phone conversations with her. From where I was seated, I thought it was an amazing spectacle. But deep down inside, I was terrified … my family jewels retracted, lol. #stageFright! … is there anything worse? Bring me a great white shark! I mean, I need rehearsals, scripts, and cue cards to do anything remotely on stage (cough). So I applauded her and the lucky patrons who had their 95 seconds taste of fame. Other than that cutting edge performance … I thought she was so hilarious … Robin Williams (RIP) will dig her bits. No pun intended. I was laughing out loud, like for real. I cried, literally. Great comedy topic … lesbians, Christians, donations, gay marriage, audience’s life story, etc. It’s unpredictable! It sounded fresh, clean, and amusing. It had just the right amount of toilet humour (or green joke). Her comedic timing is excellent … and the faces that she made were icing to the gag … (baulling). I’m telling you, she can do a joke without uttering a word! I’ve seen this happen. Bottom line is … I was impressed.\nRobbie Turner is a well-rounded drag entertainer, but I think her biggest HUGEST strength is her comedic timing – her natural gift of comedy. All she really need is an audience and a microphone. Bam! There’s your show. No script needed. I would dare say she can go head-to-head with Bianca Del Rio at funny. Trust!\nTangent time: One time, Shangela and Alyssa Edwards did a gig at R Place (March 15, 2014), and for some reason, (I won’t tell) … it took Shangela a while to get ready for her number. So, RT took the microphone and did her thing to stall the show. Thank you Shangela! It was one of the funniest impromptu stand-up I’ve ever seen! I was crying and had cramps as a result.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you have any advice on how to win the peg game successfully? Maybe a step-by-step guide with 10 steps?", "output": "You may have come across the \"Peg Game\" in a number of restaurants throughout the country. The game consists of a small wooden triangle board with 15 holes in it and 14 pegs. Starting with one empty spot, the player is supposed to jump pegs until there is only one left. Some of these games state that if you can complete them, you're a genius- so here's an easy strategy to win the game and impress your family and friends!\n1. Learn the rules.: Like checkers, the point of the game is to jump pegs and remove them from the game. The rules are simple:\n\nTo jump a peg, it must have an empty space next to it.\nYou can use any peg as a jumper, as long as the peg you jump is directly adjacent to it and has an open space next to it.\nEvery peg you jump must be removed.\nYou win when there is only one peg left.\n2. Understand the board.: Each space on the board has a number from 1 to 15. The top point of the triangle is position 1, and the bottom right is position 15. This list will use this numbering scheme when describing moves, so keep it in mind.\n3. Learn the theory behind the puzzle.: There is an intricate mathematical theory that explains the puzzle. This isn't all necessary to win the game, but there are some highlights to keep in mind that will help you solve the puzzle.\n\nMathematically, you can mess the game up with two bad moves. That means that after just two bad moves, the puzzle becomes impossible to solve. Make your moves count!\nPlan your moves carefully. If you move randomly there is a 50% chance you'll end up with an unsolvable puzzle within two moves.\n\nThere are 6,816 solutions to the puzzle. All those solutions, however, are just modifications of two main solution patterns.\n4. Begin the game.: Start with position 1 empty. This would be the top point of the triangle. There are other methods of solving the puzzle, but this one is the most common and easiest.\nIn the following videos, grey circles indicate empty holes, red circles indicate pegs you will be moving, and blue holes indicate pegs that are not in play.\n5. Make the diamond shape.: This basic pattern can be repeated throughout the board, helping you win the game.\n\nTake the peg in position 4 and jump it over the peg in position 2. It will then be in position 1.\nUse the peg in position 6 to jump position 5. It will now be in position 4.\nUse the peg in position 1 to jump position 3. It will now be in position 6.\nThese moves will give you the diamond base.\n6. Make two groups of pegs.: As you'll see, the next set of moves will divide the pegs into two groups, one on each side of the triangle.\n\nMove the peg in position 7 to position 2, jumping position 4.\nMove peg 13 to position 4.\nNext, move peg 10 to position 8.\nYou should now have two groups of pegs, with 5 pegs on the left side and 3 on the right.\n7. Separate the triangle in two.: This next set of steps will make a curved line across the triangle, dividing it into two parts.\n\nMove peg 2 to position 7. Then take that same peg and move it to position 9.\nNext, move peg 15 to position 13.\n8. Move your last pegs to the bottom row.: These moves will leave you with three final pegs, all in the bottom row.\n\nMove peg 12 into position 14.\nNext move peg 6 to position 13.\nYou should now just have three pegs left in the bottom row.\n9. Complete the last moves.: Move peg 14 to position 12. Then make the last move, peg 11 to position 13.\n10. Win the game.: The ending peg should be in the 13th hole. Congratulations! You've just completed the Peg Game.\n\nYou can take this game when you go for babysitting.\nIt will be fun and exciting for the kid.\nThe parents will appreciate that you have come with something to keep the kid engaged.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.\n\"As Californians grapple with the Gov. Brown’s mandatory water reductions, the question is being asked, what is the responsible use of water during a drought of this magnitude? \n  \n As a company with a century-long history of operations in California and more than 1,500 employees across the state, Nestlé Waters welcomes the dialogue about our company’s water use in California. Some are understandably curious about our operations and the sources of the water we bottle. \n  \n I know some believe that drought conditions should bring the bottling of water to an end. Experts on water use who have studied the issue have recognized, however, that bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought. \n  \n Nestlé Waters operates five California bottling facilities, using a total of 705 million gallons of water per year. To put that amount in perspective, this is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses. \n  \n We adhere to all local, state and federal regulations regarding our operations, all of which are in good standing, including our permit to transmit water in the San Bernardino National Forest. Recent accounts have inaccurately described our permit as “expired.” Like several hundred other special permit holders in the San Bernardino National Forest — and some 3,000 nationwide — whose permit is under review, our permit remains valid and, according to federal law, “does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.” \n  \n Regardless of the fact that we are a small water user, everyone should be part of the solution, including Nestlé Waters. There is a need for greater transparency as well as comprehensive and balanced oversight of all water users. We take our role as a water steward seriously and support conservation efforts to safeguard the long-term environmental sustainability of California. \n  \n We know there is more to do and we strive for high standards and best practices for our operations. That is why we are implementing a top-to-bottom review of our drought contingency plans, actively seeking new ways to improve our operations in California to save water across Nestlé facilities, as we have done globally. \n  \n We agree that how California manages its groundwater supplies is of critical importance. Water use regulations should exist to both protect the health of environmental habitats and to ensure fairness to all users. \n  \n In light of the governor’s mandatory water reductions of 25 percent in communities across the state, we at Nestlé Waters are doubling down on our drought-mitigation efforts. Our largest plant is Silver LEED-certified, and we have made investments in all our facilities to further reduce water use. Our latest conservation measures include a waste-water recovery project expected to save annually 25 million gallons of water. We supported the recent water bond to improve infrastructure and protect and restore watersheds and ecosystems and we believe that California’s new groundwater management legislation is a step in the right direction. This legislation takes an important step forward; however, we must be diligent in its implementation and pursue timely improvements in both measurement and oversight to ensure the sustainability of California’s groundwater basins. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n Which still raises the question, how should bottled water be viewed among conversations around the use of California’s water resources? \n  \n Whether from the bottle or the tap, using water for human hydration is one of its highest uses. There is a real need to have the right water at the right time at the right place. \n  \n The reality is demand for bottled water is higher than it has ever been, in large measure because people are looking for healthier alternatives to juices, soft drinks and in some cases, beer and wine. On top of that, the production of these beverages requires two to eight times as much water as bottled water, and that does not include the additional water necessary to grow the ingredients in those products. \n  \n As a company with a California heritage of more than 100 years, we understand that what we do matters; we care about the impact and contribution we make. We are committed to being a good steward of water resources and engaging in a thoughtful dialogue on the role of water in California’s unparalleled environment and economy. \n  \n Tim Brown is chairman, president and CEO of Nestlé Waters North America. ||||| California is in the third year of what may be the worst drought in 400 years, and its citizens are being fined for wasting water on their own lawns. Meanwhile, Nestlé, which owns a bottling plant on the reservation of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, is pulling undisclosed amounts of water from the ground -- and they're doing it legally. \n  \n Nestlé is exempt from local water agencies, so they don't need to reveal how much water they're taking. But the water agency estimates that they're taking an average of 244 million gallons of water a year. This water is purified and sold as bottled water under the Nestlé Pure Life label. \n  \n With the scarcity of water as it is, Nestlé should show more compassion for poor communities. They are significantly contributing to the area's water shortage. The water they pumped last year alone would have been enough to supply 400 homes. Clean water should be a basic right, not a priviledge afforded to the wealthy! Please sign the petition to urge Nestlé to stop stealing water from California's poorest communities! ||||| Join KPCC's AirTalk with host Larry Mantle weekdays for lively and in-depth discussions of city news, politics, science, the arts, entertainment, and more. Call-in number: 866-893-5722 \n  \n “Absolutely not. In fact, if I could increase it, I would.” \n  \n This was the answer Nestlé Waters North America CEO Tim Brown gave when Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, asked him whether he would ever consider moving his company's bottling operations out of California during an interview on Wednesday with Larry Mantle on AirTalk. \n  \n \"If I stop bottling water tomorrow,\" said Brown, \"people would buy another brand of bottled water. As the second largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others aren’t filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we’re very happy [consumers] are doing it in a healthier way.” \n  \n As the Golden State wheezes its way through a historic drought, criticism for bottled water companies operating factories here has been harsh. Just over a week after a Mother Jones investigation, Starbucks announced that it would be moving bottling operations for its Ethos Water brand from California to Pennsylvania because of severe drought conditions. A day before the Mother Jones story broke, Brown wrote an op-ed in the San Bernardino Sun on why the bottled water industry isn't contributing to the drought. \n  \n On Tuesday, Nestlé said that it is investing $7 million on technology and upgrades that would turn its Modesto milk factory into a “zero water” by extracting water from the milk production process and using it in factory operations. \n  \n “We have these cooling towers [for milk] that use water,” says Brown. “Previously, that would have been fresh water that we would’ve drawn out of the municipal supply. Now, we can use our own water that had come previously from the milk. That water, normally, would’ve gone into the waste stream. Now it can be reused or recycled.” \n  \n Brown says Nestlé outfitted its factory in Jalisco, Mexico with the \"zero water\" technology last year and doing so at the Modesto factory will save almost 63 million gallons of water annually. He added that they've found another 26 million gallons they could save a year at Nestlé USA plants in Bakersfield and Tulare. \n  \n \"That's adaptation,\" says Brown. \"Regardless of whether we were in the bottled water business or not, we would need to be doing things like this to operate in a water-scarce environment.\" \n  \n Famiglietti, who teaches Earth system science at UC Irvine in addition to being NASA JPL's top water scientist, says Nestlé has a strong reputation when it comes to environmental stewardship. But he says bottling water still takes 30 to 50 percent more water than turning on the tap, and he's concerned companies like Nestlé or Starbucks might be using and bottling thousands of acre-feet of water in California. \n  \n Famiglietti warns that while it may not seem like much, it's more than a drop in the bucket. \n  \n “An acre-foot [nearly 326,000 gallons] is enough water to supply an entire family for a year. So, in this time when we’re being asked to flush our toilets less and less, we have to ask the question: Is this really an environmentally, ethically correct thing to be doing right now?” \n  \n Still, Nestlé’s Brown says being water-conscious extends far beyond the bottled water industry. \n  \n “Everybody in every facet of water in California has to find better design, better use, better ways to be more efficient. We have to look at design and how we touch water in a water scarce environment. There’s been 17 droughts in the last 48 years. We’re in this one, there will be more, and we all have to look at how water is going to move throughout the state.” \n  \n The upgrades to Nestlé's Modesto plant are expected to be finished by the end of 2016. Nestlé Waters North America has five bottled water facilities in the state of California, and its brands include Arrowhead, Pure Life, Poland Spring, and Deer Park. \n  \n Meanwhile, as the drought here in California trickles on, Famiglietti suggests that the greater problem lies not in the bottled water industry or even in the drought. \n  \n “I think that we also have, with the greater water crisis here that we face in California, a human behavior problem. We need to change our behavior with respect to water and our understanding of how much water we actually have available to us, not only in California, but around the country.” \n  \n Guests: \n  \n Jay Famiglietti, hydrologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a professor of Earth System Science at UC Irvine \n  \n Tim Brown, CEO of Nestlé Waters North America ||||| Nestlé boss says he wants to bottle more water in California despite drought \n  \n The boss of Nestlé Waters has said the company wants to increase the amount of water it bottles in California despite a devastating drought across the state that has triggered demonstrations at the corporation’s bottling plant. \n  \n  \n  \n Tim Brown, chief executive of Nestlé Waters North America, said the company would “absolutely not” stop bottling in California and would actually like to “increase” the amount of ground source water it uses. \n  \n  \n  \n Asked in a local radio interview if Nestlé would consider following Starbucks’ lead and stop bottling water in California during the drought, Brown said: “Absolutely not. In fact, if I could increase it, I would. \n  \n  \n  \n “The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water,” Brown said in a discussion with a Nasa hydrologist on 89.3 KPCC radio. “People need to hydrate. As the second largest bottler in the state, we’re filling a role many others are filling. It’s driven by consumer demand, it’s driven by an on-the-go society that needs to hydrate. Frankly, we’re very happy they are doing it in a healthier way.” \n  \n Brown admitted that Nestlé currently wastes about 30% of the 700m gallons of water a year it draws from the ground in California. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to reduce water waste at its bottling plants in Bakersfield and Tulare by 12%. \n  \n  \n  \n More than 82,000 people have signed a petition calling on Nestlé to stop bottling from a spring in southern California, and protesters armed with plastic pitchforks have blocked the entrance to a Nestlé plant in Sacramento. \n  \n  \n  \n Despite the protests, Brown said: “We feel good about what we’re doing delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California.” \n  \n  \n  \n Starbucks has announced plans to stop sourcing its bottled water from California after embarrassing revelations that its “water conservation” Ethos brand bottled water was sourced from the drought-stricken state. \n  \n  \n  \n “It seems hard to imagine, but more than 1bn people on our planet can’t get clean water to drink,” Starbucks says on its website. “Ethos® Water was created to help raise awareness about this terrible crisis and provide children with access to clean water.” Five cents from the sale of each Ethos bottle, which costs about $2, goes towards Starbucks’ Ethos Water Fund supporting water, sanitation and hygiene education programs across the world. \n  \n  \n  \n The company said it would move Ethos production to Pennsylvania for the duration of the drought. “We are committed to our mission to be a globally responsible company and to support the people of the state of California as they face this unprecedented drought,” John Kelly, Starbucks’ senior vice-president of global responsibility and public policy, said last week. \n  \n Walmart, which also bottles water in California, has refused to move its production out of the state. “The drought in California is very concerning for many of our customers and our associates,” a spokesman said. “We share those concerns and are tracking it closely. Our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We have and continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers who count on us across California.” \n  \n  \n  \n Sustainability charity Food & Water Watch has called for a moratorium on all water bottling across the state. “It’s the worst drought we’ve seen in a long time, and it’s irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that’s supposed to be a public resource,” a spokesman said. “We’re calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.” \n  \n  ||||| WASHINGTON, DC and VEVEY, CH – May 12, 2015 – Nestlé is investing in innovative technology to help reduce the amount of water it uses in California at the five water bottling plants and four facilities where food or petcare products are manufactured. \n  \n “Technology we have already deployed successfully elsewhere in the world to help address the challenges of water scarcity will improve our water use efficiency, relieving pressure on California’s water resources,” says Nestlé’s Head of Operations José Lopez. \n  \n Last year in Mexico, Nestlé opened its first ‘zero water’ plant, which extracts all the water it needs from milk used to manufacture dairy products. \n  \n Work is underway to transform the Nestlé USA milk factory in the city of Modesto into a ‘zero water’ factory, meaning the plant will not use any local freshwater resources for its operations. \n  \n The project should save nearly 63 million gallons (238,000 cubic meters) of water each year, equivalent to 71% of absolute withdrawals in 2014. \n  \n Around $7 million has been invested in the project which is due to be completed by the end of 2016. \n  \n At the Nestlé USA factories in Bakersfield and Tulare savings of more than 26 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of water each year have been identified, potentially reducing the plants’ absolute annual withdrawals by 12% compared to 2014 levels. \n  \n And planned investments this year in conservation measures to reduce the amount of water used in Nestlé Waters’ bottling plants in California are projected to save 55 million gallons of water (208,000 cubic meters) a year, a reduction of nearly 8% compared to 2014 levels. \n  \n Further measures to reduce potential water wastage at these plants are under consideration, and as these are identified there will be further updates. \n  \n Technological solutions \n  \n Nestlé uses a phased approach to reduce water in its factories. \n  \n First, engineers look for ways to optimize the processes. \n  \n Second, they look for opportunities to reuse the water, for example using cooling water in vacuum systems. \n  \n In the third phase, such as in the zero-water factory, they deploy innovative methods to extract water from raw materials and then recycle it. \n  \n In California Nestlé will apply a methodology called ‘Water Target Setting’ which not only identifies opportunities to reduce water usage but also the most appropriate technology to be implemented. \n  \n This approach has been used in more than 80 factories worldwide, identifying opportunities to reduce water usage by 10%-30% depending on the location. \n  \n For example at a Nestlé factory in the UK an anaerobic digestion system which converts solid and liquid sewage waste into clean water and natural gas has reduced the plant’s water footprint while at the same time cutting the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, and reducing solid waste significantly. \n  \n Going further \n  \n Nestlé is carrying out assessments of its facilities in California as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational performance and the impact of its plants on the watersheds in which they operate. \n  \n The state of California uses nearly 50 billion cubic metres (13 trillion gallons) of water a year, of which Nestlé’s nine plants use less than 4 million cubic metres (1 billion gallons). \n  \n “Our water bottling operations in California have come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks,” says Mr Lopez. \n  \n “We are focused on how to adapt our bottling and our manufacturing operations, and our supply chain, to make them more resilient and more resistant to drought conditions,” he says. “We will test innovative solutions, prove they are efficient and effective and will share what we learn with others.” \n  \n The World Resources Institute is helping Nestlé to better understand water risks to the company’s food and bottled water manufacturing operations in their localities and to identify water stewardship opportunities. \n  \n Work is also underway to implement the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) international standard in each of Nestlé’s nine California factories, within two years. \n  \n The standard is a set of rigorous criteria for how water should be managed in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically beneficial. \n  \n These efforts represent Nestlé’s long term commitment to the state of California. \n  \n Water use reduction targets \n  \n Globally, Nestlé has already cut its total water withdrawal in absolute terms by almost one-third over the past 10 years, and has publicly committed to do more. \n  \n It aims to reduce its withdrawal per tonne of product by 40% by 2015, compared to 2005. \n  \n It currently has 376 water-saving projects underway in its factories worldwide, which are projected to save around 1.84 million cubic metres of water this year. \n  \n About Nestlé in the United States \n  \n Nestlé in the United States is committed to being a trusted leader in nutrition, health and

In fact, despite demonstrations and a slew of online petitions (like this, this, and this) aimed at getting Nestlé to stop what it's doing, the company would, in a perfect world, boost the 700 million gallons of water it now uses. \"If I could increase it, I would,\" says Tim Brown, who heads Nestlé Waters North America, in an interview with radio station KPCC. \"The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water. We feel good about what we're doing, delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California,\" he said, per the Guardian. (In the same interview, NASA JPL's top water scientist points out that bottling water requires as much as 50% more water than turning on the tap.) Brown says Nestlé wastes some 30% of the groundwater it draws from the state, but the company this week announced plans to cut that figure by 12% at its Bakersfield and Tulare bottling facilities—two of five in the state—for a savings of 26 million gallons. That isn't nearly enough to help combat \"the worst drought we've seen in a long time,\" says charity Food & Water Watch. \"It's irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that's supposed to be a public resource,\" a rep says. \"We're calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.\" In an editorial for the San Bernardino County Sun in late April, Brown argued that \"bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought\" and noted that the 700 million gallons Nestlé uses \"is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses.\" (Another big company is similarly under fire.)", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Are Nielsen TV ratings accurate?\n\nI remember I read somewhere that the US Nielsen rating was calculated by something like 25,000 households. That sounds extremely small compared to the number of people that actually have TVs.\nWhat's more - these ratings are then broken into demographics.\nAlso, aside from the sample size, there is statistical bias. I would think that someone who actually wants to participate in one of these things would be different to just your average person. There's probably a good deal of measurement error, as you are reliant on people keeping log books etc.\nYet, these ratings are what TV channels use to auction off their advertising time and decide on which shows they choose to keep or cancel.\nAre there any evidence supporting why TV ratings are a accurate mesasure of how popular or watched a show is?\n\nA:\n\nAccording to Nielsen:\n\nElectronic metering technology is at the heart of the Nielsen ratings process. Our tools capture not only what channel is being watched, but also who is watching and when, including “time-shifted” viewing.\nNielsen’s TV families represent a cross-section of representative homes throughout the U.S. Their viewing is measured by our TV meters and Local People Meters which capture information on what’s being viewed and when and, in the major U.S. markets, specifically who and how many are watching. Additionally, we collect more than two million paper diaries from across the country each year during “sweeps.”\n\nThe method that the asker calls into question is Nielsen's traditional diary based ratings calculations. (Although note that even the automated data collection is only permitted in households that have been invited by Nielsen). Put simply, the diary ratings work like this: A call center places calls to households in target market areas and ask for permission to send a \"ratings diary\". If the household agrees, they will be sent one diary for each working television in the household (up to five), and each diary will contain a cash (the amount varies) as an incentive to complete the diary. The notion that \"only certain types of people\" would take time to complete the diaries is strictly opinion, but it isn't a far stretch to think that perhaps more retired or unemployed people would find this arrangement ideal.\nThe diaries usually contain fourteen pages (although if the household has digital video recording hardware two additional pages are included, allowing for the previously mentioned 'time-shifted' viewing to be recorded). Each page can hold twelve hours worth of viewing.\nI found this picture of an actual diary page by searching Google images:\nhttp://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k170/Bittybell/Scans/NielsenDiary-2.jpg\nAs you can see, the household is expected to provide the following information for every fifteen minutes during the survey period (of seven days):\n\nI. Whether or not the tv is on\nII. The call letters of the station, or the name\nIII. The channel number\nIV. The name of the program\nV. Who is viewing the program\n\nThe household can indicate an above response by drawing a vertical line under the information that they wish to \"carry down\" to lower grids.\nWhile theoretically perfect in it's design, the diaries are rarely filled out with 100% accuracy. So how are the books interpreted? An office in Venice, FL collects all of the diaries via US mail, and specially trained temporary employees enter the data into computer terminals. If data on the diaries conflicts (basic example: what if the channel number does not match the supplied call letters?) a stringent set of guidelines is used to come up with the appropriate data, and sometimes the data cannot be used. The information entered into the terminals is double checked by separate employees who's only job is to verify. The Nielsen company claims that this results in over 99% accuracy.\nOne personal criticism of the system as it exists now is this: sometimes households misinterpret how to fill out the diaries. As simple as they seem, some people struggle with them. If the employee receives a filled-out diary with information that seems \"sketchy\" at best (for example: a user mistakes the \"tv on\" column for the \"tv off\" column and indicates that the tv is always on), the procedure is to enter the data regardless (in some occasions). The method is scientific (they can't prove the user was confused, what if they really DID mean to do this?), but I'm unconvinced they've really taken into account the margin of human error on the household's end.\nThe truth is that nobody can provide a definite answer in regards to whether or not the ratings are 100% accurate, the numbers are just too high. In my opinion they're as accurate as they're going to get until Nielsen adopts a strictly electronic form of television viewership monitoring.", "output": "I work for one of Nielsen's competitors, doing TV ratings.\n\n25,000 households. That sounds extremely small compared to the number of people that actually have TVs\n\nAt heart, this is a question about sampling. How can a small sample accurately reflect the entire population? And how accurate is \"accurate\"? Nobody is really interested in the precise number of viewers; they want a measurement that is accurate enough for practical purposes. So the sample can be much smaller than the total population, if the sample is large enough, and is representative of the whole population.\nWe (and I assume Nielsen too) do not arbitrarily or entirely randomly select people to be panellists. We collect demographic data about the panellists and have the corresponding data for the whole population, found using an \"establishment survey\". We recruit panellists so the demographics of the panellists reflect the demographics of the whole population. This can make recruitment difficult for some demographic groups. This is what BARB (the UK TV ratings organization) says:\n\nPanel homes are selected via a multi-stage, stratified and un-clustered sample design so that the panel is representative of all television households across the whole of the UK. A range of individual and household characteristics are deployed as panel controls to ensure that the panel remains representative.\n\nOnce we have some measurements for the panel, we do not simply scale the numbers up to the whole population. First, some \"weighting\" is done. This compensates for (usually short term) deviations of the demographics of the panel from the demographics of the population. So, for example, if it transpired one day that, due to technical problems, the raw measurements came from too few HD-TV households, those panellists that were from HD-cable housholds would be given more weight.\nBARB uses \"rim-weighting\":\n\nRim-weighting is applied to the panel data to incorporate numerous weighting and\n  grossing variables", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

He told NPR that MSL's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) Instrument discovered something extremely interesting, claiming that \"the data is gonna be one for the history books. It's looking really good.\" He went on to say that the discovery was made from a soil sample taken by the SAM Instrument. This was most likely one of the five scoop samples taken from Rocknest (imaged right).\nCould organics have been discovered? Or evidence of past or present life? Such a finding would shake the foundations of not only the scientific community, but of humanity's perception of themselves in the grand scheme of the universe. In a previous post (excerpted below) I delved into why finding life on Mars would be significant and what it would mean for us here on Earth.\nWe discover life on Mars that shares the same genetic code as life on Earth. The chances that DNA, a specialized, enormously complex molecule, evolved separately on two planets are astronomical. This would prove that life on Mars and life on Earth have a common origin. Understanding this would help humanity to understand more about the evolution of life on our planet.\nWe discover life on Mars that has a different genetic code from life on Earth. This would prove that life on Mars and life on Earth arose independently. If this is the case it must mean that life is common throughout the galaxy because two adjacent planets developing life independently implies that in the right conditions life develops. Such a discovery would lend credence to the adage that \"where there is water, there is life.\" The discovery of life with a different genetic makeup would help to renew the search for extraterrestrial life and likely increase the priority of discovering more life in the universe.\nObviously all this is speculation for now, but the discovery of extraterrestrial life is one that has been sought for since man first looked up at the stars. For now though we are left waiting until the official announcement is made, which Space.com has confirmed will be between 3-7 Dec at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting taking place in San Francisco.\nAfter all, if an announcement of life is to be made, what's another few weeks when we've been waiting thousands of years?\nJust how much less likely is it that DNA evolved independently on both planets than that the two planets gave rise to distinctly different coding chemistry? I have no idea, but isn't DNA, as complex as genes can be, an elegantly \"convenient\" adaptation, a relatively simple utilization of carbon links? Have biochemist designed alternate molecules capable of communicating instructions for assembling proteins? While inventing other molecules for carrying out DNA functions would be quite a trick, once the basic principle waswere discovered, I can't help wondering whether similar chemistry has been devised to accomplish similar ends. Or could DNA prove to be a widespread pattern wherever the proper components and processes occur together. I must be wrong, since you never read that DNA might turn out to be a common \"solution.\" Kindly set me straight.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain the concept of providing visual cues when loading an app in a slow or unreliable internet environment.", "output": "Who said construction sites have to look bad ?\nComing from a developed country it can be easy to take high speed internet for granted. Any site, video or song can be consumed on demand with ubiquitous 4G and WiFi networks.\nLast couple of months I have been traveling around remote northern parts of Australia and beautiful Bali. Finding a good internet connection in these places can be very challenging and sometimes even impossible. Connection is flaky and most of the time downright slow. Sharing a single WiFi access point with dozens of lovely hostel guests also doesn’t make the situation any better.\nIf we realize that in many places slow and unreliable internet is an inescapable fact of life we can start thinking about how we can enhance our apps to provide best user experience possible.\nPsst! I just wrote a new article about Angular CLI budgets that help you keep your app lean and fast so that it loads fast on slow networks… Check it out!\nAngular CLI used to display black “Loading…” text on the white background but as of version 1.5.0 we only get <app-root></app-root> in our index.html file. This means that our users will see only blank white screen until our app and all vendor libraries are fully loaded and Angular successfully bootstrapped. This can easily take anything from three to tens of seconds on slower networks.\nLets provide our user with visual cues that our app is not broken and is in fact loading. This will increase probability that user will wait and use our app instead of leaving and searching for some alternatives.\nADVANCED: Some of you are surely already thinking about PWAs and their support for better offline / flaky internet scenarios but even with PWA we still need some visual loading cue during the initial visit until everything was loaded and cached in the service worker.\nDuring the development of our app we’re used to working with raw source files, be it Typescript or Sass styles. However this is not the form in which our app is consumed by the browser.\nBuilding our app means that Angular CLI uses Webpack and a multitude of loaders to transpile and process all source files and assets to provide us with bundles which we then deploy to a server. Our app becomes available and can be requested by any user possessing correct URL.\nWhat happens when user navigates browser to our app?\nThis means that there can be considerable amount of time between displaying of index.html content and displaying Angular components after successful Angular app bootstrap.\nBrowser parses index.html file in top to bottom fashion and Angular CLI injects script tags with bundle references at the end of the body just before the closing </body> tag.\nThis enables us to provide layout and inline styles in our index.html which will be parsed and rendered straight away even before initiating requests to load our bundle files.\nOur loading animation consist of animated SVG spinner and logo in the middle. It’s implemented using inline style tag in the<head> and loading layout inside of the <app-root> component.\nCool, we have a spinner but logo is still just a class name on a div tag (<div class=”logo”></div> ) and won’t display anything useful just yet.\nThe easiest and most “Angular” way to display logo before app bootstrap when using Angular CLI is to add additional styles entry in our angular-cli.json file.\nThat way we can create new styles-app-loading.scss file in our src folder and set our logo as a background.\n🤫 Psst! Do you think that NgRx or Redux are overkill for your needs? Looking for something simpler? Check out @angular-extensions/model library!\nWe are using additional file for app loading style so that we can reference our logo image as css background. This works very well with Angular CLI which restricts our access to the underlying Webpack configuration.\nReferenced logo will get processed by Webpack loader as an asset. This means it will get copied to the dist folder with properly hashed file name for cache busting during the prod build.\nIn case of very small logo it is better to convert it into base64 string and inline it directly in index.html like this `<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,...the actual data...\" alt=\"My App Logo\">.\nThis solution displays logo immediately but is not well suited for larger logos because they will bloat size of index.html significantly.\nI did that without checking original logo file size and ended up with GitHub project with HTML as the most used language with around 70% share. That’s right it was the inlined logo in my index.html.\nCheck out how all of this works in practice in angular-ngrx-material-starter app and repository. To see the loading itself try using Chrome Dev Tools and throttle your network speed to Slow 3G 🐢.\nI hope you found this tutorial helpful and consider implementing it in your app. Please support this article with your 👏 👏 👏 to spread these tips to a wider audience!", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Have the recent election results changed ACA compliance rules for 2016?", "output": "This is the first in a series of articles regarding reporting under the Affordable Care Act in light of the election. Please enter your email above should you wish to receive future publications.\nThe election of President Trump on Wednesday morning created new complications and uncertainty in the already complex world of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and, in particular, ACA compliance in 2016. In this article we explore the four possible outcomes that may occur with regard to 2016 reporting. As the math below shows, the logical choice for all employers is compliance with the ACA reporting requirements in 2016.\nAfter the election, there are still only two possible courses of action for an employer to take with regard to ACA compliance. An employer has the option to comply with the law and regulations that remain unchanged despite the election. This is the best course of action for all employers to follow as there is no risk of an employer being subject to penalties for non-action. Alternatively, an employer could ignore the law and regulations and not comply with the ACA reporting requirements in 2016. The second option comes with significant financial risk.\nSimilarly, the government will have two courses of actions it could take after the election. The government could continue to enforce the ACA reporting requirements as required by law and the accompanying regulations. This is the government’s likely course of action because the government has already provided premium tax credits in 2016 to individuals. The funding mechanism for the premium tax credits is the section 4980H penalties which the government determines in part through the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C. Therefore, the ACA reporting by employers through the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C is necessary to determine which employers owe a penalty to fund the premium tax credits. Alternatively, and unlikely, the government could ignore the ACA reporting requirements and give any employer who does not comply with the law a free pass on any penalties. This unlikely scenario would pile on to an already enormous deficit, something Republicans have voiced concern over for years.\nCombining the two employer options with the two government options we are left with four possible outcomes for an employer. First, an employer could comply with the law and the government could enforce the ACA reporting requirements as required by law and the accompanying regulations. Complying with the law as it is currently written does not expose the employer to any risk.\nSecond, an employer could ignore the ACA reporting requirements and the government could enforce the ACA reporting requirements as required by law and the accompanying regulations. An employer can be penalized $260 per return for failing to file a correct information return (the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C filed with the IRS). Similarly, an employer can be penalized $260 per statement for failing to provide a correct payee statement (the Form 1095-C that must be furnished to certain employees by January 31, 2017). Each penalty is separately capped at $3,193,000. However, these penalties can be increased if there is intentional disregard for the filing requirements. If the government finds there was an intentional disregard for the filing of the Forms 1094-C or 1095-C, the penalties are each separately increased to at least $530 per return. The penalty can be greater based on other tax provisions that go beyond the scope of this article. To make matters worse, there is no cap on the penalty if there is an intentional disregard for the filing. In the worst case scenario, an employer intentionally does not provide the Form 1095-C to the individual or file the Form 1095-C with the government which could subject the employer to a penalty of $1,060 for just a single employee!\nIn a rational market, if the chances of x are equal to or greater than a half percent, an employer would choose to pay the $5 compliance fee rather than risk paying the $1,060 penalty. While this example may oversimplify things a little, it is clear that the delta between the penalty for noncompliance and the low cost of compliance makes the rational choice of compliance the clear strategy. Additionally, the chances of the IRS enforcing the penalties for not filing the Form 1095-C are much greater than a half percent making the decision that much easier for employers. If it turns out an employer did unnecessary compliance work, the employer would still have made the correct decision before all of the cards had been turned over.\nFinally, an employer and the government could both ignore the ACA reporting requirements. In this scenario, the employer would be rewarded by not paying the compliance fees in 2016. However, this is not a rational choice as shown in the equation above given the size of the penalty for noncompliance compared to the minuscule cost of compliance.\nWhile the future of the ACA is far from clear, the logical choice for every employer is to submit the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C by the January 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 deadlines. President Trump will not take office until January 20, 2017 and the Forms 1095-C for the 2016 tax year must be provided to employees on January 31, 2017. We are skeptical the government will move quickly to repeal the reporting portion of the ACA or retroactively repeal the reporting requirement which is imperative to fund the premium tax credits that have already been paid out in 2016. The ACA will surely evolve under President Trump, but noncompliance in 2016 is not worth the financial risk.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The five survivors—Forbes, American Flying Officer Johnny Hammond Ronald Reagan, Flight Sgt. Kirk Edwards Alan Hale, Sr., Flying Officer Jed Forrest Arthur Kennedy, and the injured Flight Sgt. Lloyd Hollis Ronald Sinclair—are quickly captured by the Germans. Interviewed by Gestapo Major Otto Baumeister Raymond Massey, Hammond creates a distraction by pretending to explain their bombers technology in technobabble doubletalk; then he suddenly knocks the major unconscious. Forbes then subdues the other soldiers and the group searches the majors office. They find papers showing a hidden Messerschmitt aircraft factory, and determine to get them to England. Setting out on their dangerous trip across enemy territory, they attack a patrol to obtain German uniforms, then sneak onto a hospital train heading for Berlin. Conveniently, Reichsmarschall Gorings private car is in the train, being transported for maintenance; they hide in the empty car, helping themselves to luxuries. Just before reaching Berlin, they are found in the car and thrown off the train; but this enables them to avoid Baumeister, who has traveled by air to overtake it.

Kaethe rejects an offer to accompany the men to England; the underground has more work to do.

{"input": "Explain why the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare failed.", "output": "He got distracted by a photographer he thought was standing too close to a soldier. He never finished his sentence.\nThe president’s attention deficit was a major problem throughout the legislative process that all-but-officially ended in failure on Tuesday. It was far from the only problem.\nHealth reform is hard even when politicians are trying to increase coverage. Republicans were trying to pass a bill that would have left tens of millions more people without coverage. Almost no experts and almost no interest groups liked the thing.\n“It’s a terrible plan. It doesn’t fix any of the problems with Obamacare, it makes those problems worse, and it creates entirely new problems,” said Jonathan Oberlander, a University of North Carolina professor who studies health policy and politics.\nWhen Republican Sen. Jerry Moran held a town hall in a tiny Kansas town in early July, he was met by a group of disability-rights activists who told him how the bill would hurt people like them.\nSimilar scenes greeted almost every other Republican member of Congress. Grassroots “resistance” groups made it impossible for Republicans to turn away from the potential human and political damage.\n“Some of these Republicans voted for a repeal back in 2015 because they knew it would have no consequence. They knew that it wouldn’t ever become law. And now they were faced with the prospect where, if they voted for this, it would harm their constituents — and then they were seeing those constituents, their faces, in their offices over the last two months,” said Angel Padilla, co-founder of the anti-Trump Indivisible network.\nTo get Obamacare passed, Barack Obama conducted a months-long parade of speeches, interviews, town halls and news conferences. Trump, renowned salesman, did almost nothing.\nWhen he did speak about health-care, he spoke in unhelpful generalities — or, astonishingly, bashed the bill as “mean.” As the initiative burned, he was using his Twitter platform to scold the media.\nFrom the beginning of the process to the end, he did not answer a single question about the specifics of his plan.\n“The president is the largest megaphone in the world. The bully pulpit is his greatest asset. And he just completely misused it to the point of malpractice,” said Rick Tyler, a MSNBC analyst and former communications director for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\nWith an approval rating below 40 per cent — 36 per cent, according to the most recent Washington Post poll — Trump just didn’t have the power to scare Congress into satisfying his whims. And his eagerness to pass any bill at all made it impossible for the White House to convince legislators that he cared about the policy specifics.\n“The reason that Congress was excited about this was he’ll sign whatever you’ll send him. But if he’s willing to sign whatever you’ll send him, he doesn’t have the credibility to message on what he’s asking for,” said Republican strategist and lobbyist Liam Donovan.\nParty unity was easy when members of Congress knew their repeal votes amounted to mere veto-fodder symbolism. When it came time to make law under a Republican president, they had to find a way to placate Medicaid-conscious moderates and damn-the-consequences right-wingers at the same time — losing two senators maximum.\nTrump calls Obamacare a “disaster” and a “catastrophe.” In reality, the law is flawed but functional.\nMillions of people buying insurance through Obamacare’s “individual markets” have experienced steep price hikes and limited choices. But millions have become insured for the first time, premiums have risen more slowly than they used to, and the number of health-related bankruptcies has plummeted.\nIn the absence of Obama himself, polling suggests more people support his Affordable Care Act than oppose it. It is hard to talk yourself into repealing a popular social benefit.\n“When you’re six years into a program, to change it when people are relying on it, there’s a fear that it may affect their own policies or their own families,” Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake told Politico.\nDuring his years-long run of anti-Obama obstruction, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell enjoyed a reputation as a master tactician. It is probably toast now.\nIt’s possible that nobody could have herded these cats into repeal-and-replace. But McConnell made a series of caucus-angering mistakes — writing the bill rapidly in secret, irritating hard-liners by attempting to privately promise moderates that the bill’s cuts would never take effect, and excluding Republican female senators from his health-care working group.\nThree female senators ended up killing the bill.\nOpposition to Obamacare galvanized the conservative grassroots into action in 2010 and the years following. But influential right-wing groups were so unenthused about the Republican bill that they did little or nothing to urge legislators to pass it.\nFacing immense left-wing pressure and scant right-wing pressure, Republicans stopped fearing that saying no would cost them their careers.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Story: Monday, March 31, 2008 The day began pleasantly enough in Oklahoma City. It was sunny, but as was often the case this time of year, windy and cool – much the same as it was on the day 27 years (and one day) ago, when the attempt was made on President Reagan’s life. There was a reason Johnny Woodward’s group did not meet on Tuesdays. They met every Monday morning for breakfast at Faye’s Café. The group, which now called themselves the ROB (Retired Old Boys) Club, dined in a private room. Johnny was especially grateful for the privacy this morning, as he did not wish for anyone to overhear what he was planning to discuss. During breakfast, he did not say or do anything that would cause the others alarm, although a couple of friends noticed that he was unusually tense. Johnny looked around the table at his four best friends. There were -- at one point in time -- six of them, including himself. But Eddie had died the same afternoon of the unsuccessful attempt on President Reagan’s life. Eddie had died on a Tuesday. And Johnny knew Eddie had been murdered. He knew also that the killer was at the table with them. Johnny didn’t completely understand his motive for doing what he was about to do. He was weary of carrying such a dark and burdensome secret all these years, but mainly he had come to realize that none of them were growing any younger, and that justice had to be carried out soon. He would not be able to live with himself any longer if the murderer continued to go on without suffering the consequences for what he had done. He also felt it would be right to allow Eddie’s family some measure of closure. He had covered for the killer long enough. After the dishes were cleared away and the coffee cups were refilled, the ROB’s favorite waitress, Mona, excused herself and, at Johnny’s request, shut the door to the private dining room. “Why did you have her do that?” asked Tim, who had worked for Johnny, as they all had, before retiring from the network department of the local school system. Johnny took a deep breath and replied, “Because we have something important to discuss.” Al, alarmed, asked, “And what would that be?” Swallowing the lump in his throat, Johnny continued, “You know yesterday was Eddie’s 27th anniversary. I have to tell you, he didn’t just die. One of us murdered him. Had it not been for the intense focus on the Reagan shooting that afternoon, I’m certain he would have been found out.” The table became eerily quiet. Al again spoke, asking, “How do you know this?” Johnny took a deep breath, “Does everyone remember where we were on that day? It was a Tuesday. It was a hectic day for me as my grandfather passed away that morning. Plus we had that big computer upgrade going on. President Reagan getting shot only added more stress to an already too long day.” “Yeah, I remember,” said Al, “we were all in the computer room. I remember we were all freezing in that cold room.” “That’s right, agreed Johnny, “and it was assumed Eddie died of a heart attack.” “Right after we heard Reagan had been shot.” Ray added. “I remember the computer room had a television set with cable, which was a novelty at the time and something Johnny got for us as a favor. When news of the shooting came on, everyone’s attention turned to the news. It was 1:40 p.m. and the upgrade was nearing completion.” Everyone focused intently on Johnny as he began to speak. “As you recall, that morning we gathered early for our upgrade. I arrived first to unlock the computer room and cabinets.” Johnny smiled, and then continued, “I would have had one of you do that, but back then only managers carried keys. Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades. By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels. It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison. As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.” Incredulous, Watson asked, “How do you know he was poisoned?” “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.” Al angrily asked, “So who did it?” Johnny took turns looking at them all. He said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.” Tim replied, sadly, “OK. Let’s go back to square one. When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.” Who is the murderer?", "output": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\n\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\n\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\n\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

If you are talking about a single she-cat, say 'koshka' (кошка).You pronounce the 'k' as in 'kind', 'o' as in 'boy', 'sh' as in 'shun', and 'ka' as in 'card'.: If you are talking about a single she-cat, say 'koshka' (кошка).You pronounce the 'k' as in 'kind', 'o' as in 'boy', 'sh' as in 'shun', and 'ka' as in 'card'.\n2. If you are talking about a single he-cat, say 'kot'.: It is the same as English 'cat' but with 'o' instead of 'a'. This 'o' sounds like the o in 'boy'.\n3. If you would like to call the cat using diminutive form (like Jake for Jakeson or Liz/Lisa/Beth for Elizabeth), you can use 'koshechka' (кошечка) for female and 'kotik' (котик) for male.: For 'koshechka', you pronounce it like 'k' as in 'kind', 'o' as in 'boy', 'sh' as in 'shun', 'ech' as in 'witch', and 'ka' and 'card'.\nFor 'kotik', you pronounce the 'k' as in 'kind', 'o' as in 'boy', 't' as in 'team', and 'ik' as in 'seek'.\n4.

{"input": "The Superman Man of Steel Series by John Byrne in the 1980s", "output": "This was the final book in the series, just before the relaunch of the Superman titles after Crisis on Infinite Earths.\nMan of Steel #6 \"The Haunting\"\n...But the opening splashes were.\nThis book starts with Clark returning to Smallville, flying in as Superman, then mingling with other passengers at the bus station in order to keep up appearances. Over dinner, he fills his parents in on his life in the big city, including his icy relationship with Lois Lane, who’s still mad over Clark scooping her in issue 2. Martha sensing that Clark has the hots for Lois tells him that he should go for it and pursue Lois romantically. Clark decides to make a move when he gets back to Metropolis.\n\"My mom says I'm cute!\"\nThat night, while sneaking a piece of Martha Kent’s famous rhubarb pie, Clark is confronted by an alien in the kitchen.\nTranslates to, \"Son, if you keep eating after midnight, you'll get fat!\"\nJor-El talks to Clark and he is suddenly in costume and transported to a holographic Krypton where he meets his mother, Lara.\nSuddenly, he is returned to Earth finding himself in the middle of a field with Lana Lang trying to calm him down. They haven’t seen each other since Clark went off into the world and became Superman.\nShe tells him about how she thought that he was going to propose after graduation but instead he talked of his responsibility to the planet and mankind. He revealed his powers to her and took her around the world. Then he left Smallville for good.\nLana says she was so bitter about the breakup that she though of outing Clark but eventually she realized that his powers do belong to the world and it’s selfish to think that Superman could belong to one person. This gets Clark reconsidering a relationship with Lois.\nHe heads to the spot where his parents found the rocket only to discover it missing. Jor-El returns and begins sharing the full knowledge of Krypton, it's history, science, and languages.\nClark begins feeling his humanity slip away but is jolted back when Jonathan wallops the hologram with a shovel, shorting it out. Perhaps, if Jonathan hadn’t arrived when he did, Clark would have turned into a cold, unfeeling Kryptonian.\nClark flies away to process all the information he received. He attempts to reconcile his his life as a human with his Kryptonian ancestry. Ultimately, he decides that Krypton made him Superman but Earth made him human.\nThat's how you end a miniseries!\nCan you even subscribe to comics anymore via mail?\nYes, this may be the most important issue in the series as far as fleshing out Byrne’s changes to the character. It establishes Superman’s humanity. Despite learning of the wonders of Krypton, he still thinks of himself as Clark, not Kal-El. He rejects their cold, super-rational culture for the more emotional culture of Earth. I think this is what makes the character interesting, \"Earth’s Mightiest Hero\" shouldn’t think of himself as an outsider or an alien, but as one of us.\nByrne’s Superman doesn’t sound like an episode of ancient aliens, where the benevolent extraterrestrials help us to become them or an Alien like Klaatu from the film, The Day The Earth Stood Still who attempts to save us from our destructive ways. This is his home and he’s just trying to leave it better than he found it.\nFinal Verdict for the Miniseries?\nI don’t think I will ever not love this series. It was the first multi-part series I was ever given and it was the beginning of my love for the character of Superman. I collected the comics, had Superman toys, did my homework by the light of a Superman desk lamp and even used Superman on my wedding save-the-dates.\nI still can't believe she agreed to this!\nI don’t feel the same way about the current New 52 Superman. He seems cold and alien,not human. I don’t get a particularly heroic or altruistic vibe from the current incarnation of the character. It seems like DC doesn’t know why Superman connects with fans in the first place. I think John Byrne did back in the 1980’s and perhaps the powers-at-be should take a look at this series when planning out Superman's future.\nSuperman during his mullet phase.\nIn honor of the release of Batman v. Superman, we’re jumping ahead to 1996 and one of my favorite Batman/Superman stories from my youth, Action Comics #719. When the Joker poisons Lois, the World’s Finest team-up to save her! See you next Wednesday!\nThese books are mostly candy ads.\nThe covers for this series were not adventurous, were they?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is the research that shows interactions of electrons in graphene can lead to viscous current flows and cause electrons to travel in the direction opposite to the applied voltage?", "output": "New work shows that interactions of electrons in graphene lead to viscous current flows, creating tiny whirlpools that cause electrons to travel in the direction opposite to the applied voltage — in direct violation of standard electrical theory. White lines show current streamlines, colors show electrical potential, and green arrows show the direction of current, for viscous (top) and normal (ohmic) flows.\nAnalysis predicts exotic behaviors such as “negative resistance,” based on fluid-like effects.\nElectrical resistance is a simple concept: Rather like friction slowing down an object rolling on a surface, resistance slows the flow of electrons through a conductive material. But two physicists have now found that electrons can sometimes cooperate to turn resistance on its head, producing vortices and backward flow of electric current.\nThe prediction of “negative resistance” is just one of a set of counterintuitive and bizarre fluid-like effects encountered under certain exotic circumstances, involving systems of strongly interacting particles in a sheet of graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The findings are described in a paper appearing today in the journal Nature Physics, by MIT professor of physics Leonid Levitov and Gregory Falkovich, a professor at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science.\nElectrons in graphene move in a neatly coordinated way, in many ways resembling the movement of viscous fluids through a tube where they are strongly affected by turbulence and vortices. This is due to interactions producing a long-range current-field response, quite different from the simple “individualist” behavior expected under ordinary circumstances, when electrons move in straight lines like pinballs bouncing among the ions, as described by Ohm's law, the researchers say.\nThe notion of electron viscosity had been suggested before in theory, but it had proven difficult to test because nobody had come up with a way to directly observe such phenomena. Now, Levitov and Falkovich say they have figured out a set of signs that can serve as an indicator of such collective effects in electron flows.\n“There was always a kind of dichotomy between what’s easy to do in theory and what’s easy to do in experiments,” Levitov says. “There was a search for an ideal system that would be easy for experimentalists to work with and also be a benchmark system with strong interactions that would show strong interactive phenomena.” Now, he says, graphene is providing many of the sought-after qualities of such a system.\nOn a graphene surface, Levitov says, “you have electrons behaving as relativistic particles coupled by interactions that are long-range and pretty strong.” With a possible exception of exotic fluids such as quark-gluon plasmas, he says, graphene may be closer to the notion of a perfect “strongly interacting fluid,” an important theoretical concept in quantum physics, than any other system we currently know.\nThe collective behavior of the charge carriers in such strongly interacting systems is quite peculiar. “In fact, it’s not so different from fluid mechanics,” Levitov says. The way fluids move can be calculated “with very little knowledge of how individual atoms of the liquid interact. We don’t care that much” about the individual motions; it’s the collective behavior that matters in such situations, he says.\nBut while that’s true in theory, he says, “the question is, even if we have it” — that is, this fluid-like behavior — “how do we detect it? Unlike ordinary fluids, where you can directly track the flow by putting some beads in it, for example, in this system we don’t have a way to view the flow directly.” But because of the two-dimensional structure of graphene, while electrons are moving through the material “we can get information from electrical measurements” done from the outside, where it is possible to place probes at any point on the sheet.\nThe new approach relies on the fact that “if you have a viscous flow, you expect the different parts of the liquid to drag on each other and produce whirlpools. They will create a flow that will drag on neighboring particles and will drive a vortex,” Levitov says. Specifically, a direct flow in the middle of a graphene ribbon will be accompanied by whirlpools developing along the sides. In those whirlpools, electrons can actually flow in the direction opposite that of the applied electric field — resulting in what the physicists refer to as negative resistance.\nWhile the whirlpools themselves can’t be observed directly, the backward movement of the electron flow in certain parts of the material can be measured and compared with the theoretical predictions.\nWhile Levitov and Falkovich have not personally carried out such experiments, Levitov says that some recent enigmatic findings do seem to fit the predicted pattern. In an experiment that has just been reported, he says “researchers saw something similar, where the voltage on the side turns negative. It’s very tempting to say” that what they saw is a manifestation of the phenomena predicted by this work.\nThe comparison of electron behavior in graphene to fluid dynamics “is not just an analogy, but a direct correspondence,” Levitov says. But there are important differences, including the fact that this fluid bears electrical charge, so it behaves not exactly like water flowing in a pipe but rather in a way similar to some plasmas, which are essentially clouds of charged particles.\nBecause this is early-stage work, Levitov says, it’s too early to tell whether it might ever have any practical applications. But one surprising implication of this work is that heat transport can couple strongly to charge transport. That is, heat can ride atop of charge flow and propagate in a wave-like fashion much faster than under ordinary conditions — perhaps as much as 10 to 100 times faster. This behavior, if achieved, might be harnessed at some point, perhaps in sensing devices with very fast response times, he speculates.\nThe work was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Israeli Science Foundation, the Russian Science Foundation, MISTI MIT-Israel Seed Fund, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies at MIT.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

He is visited by an old friend, Father Flanagan Spencer Tracy who runs a home for indigent men in Omaha, Nebraska. When the prison officials suggest that the condemned man owes the state a debt, Father Flanagan witnesses the condemned mans diatribe to prison officials and a reporter that describes his awful plight as a homeless and friendless boy who was a ward in state institutions. After the convicted man asks the officials to leave, Father Flanagan provides some comfort and wisdom. On the train back to Omaha, Father Flanagan is transformed in his humanitarian mission by revelations echoed in the words imparted by the condemned mans litany of hardships experienced as a child without friends or family as a ward of the state. Father Flanagan believes there is no such thing as a bad boy and spends his life attempting to prove it. He battles indifference, the legal system, and often even the boys, to build a sanctuary that he calls Boys Town. The boys have their own government, make their own rules, and dish out their own punishment. One boy, Whitey Marsh Mickey Rooney, is as much as anyone can handle. Whiteys older brother, in prison for murder, asks Father Flanagan to take Whitey — a poolroom shark and tough talking hoodlum — to Boys Town. Whiteys older brother escapes custody during transfer to federal prison. Whitey stays, though, and runs for mayor of Boys Town, determined to win with his dont be a sucker campaign slogan. When the boys instead elect handicapped Tony Ponessa Gene Reynolds and reject Whiteys shoddy campaigning, Whitey decides to leave. Only little Pee Wee Bobs Watson, the Boys Town mascot, catches up with him and pulls on his sleeve, pleading, “We’re going to be pals, ain’t we?” Whitey, nearly in tears refuses and pushes the child to the ground and tells him to go back. He then storms across the highway, and Pee Wee, caught in the tail wind, is too upset about his hero to think about oncoming traffic. When Pee Wee begins to cry, he is hit by a car, Whitey leaves, feeling guilty and hurt. He accidentally comes upon a bank robbery in Omaha and runs into Joe, who mistakenly shoots him in the leg. Joe takes Whitey to a church and calls Flanagan anonymously, after which Whitey is taken back to Boys Town. The sheriff comes to get Whitey, but Flanagan offers to take full responsibility for the boy. Whitey refuses to tell Flanagan about the robbery, because he has promised not to inform on Joe, but when he realizes that his silence could result in the end of Boys Town, he goes to Joes hideout. Joe, realizing with Whitey that Boys Town is more important than themselves, releases his brother from his promise. His cohorts want to kill Whitey, but Joe protects him until Flanagan and the boys arrive at their hideout. The criminals are recaptured and Boys Towns reward is a flood of donations. A now committed Whitey is elected the new mayor of Boys Town by acclamation and Dave resigns himself to go into more debt as Flanagan tells him of his new ideas for expanding the facility.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you know how can I relieve stress?", "output": "Stress. We all deal with it. Whether it arises from our jobs, family life, drama with friends, a relationship problem, or finances, stress is there. While a little stress is good for you, allowing you to grow physically and mentally, excessive and chronic stress is harmful. Prolonged stress can even lead to tension headaches and other health problems that limit your functioning at work, at school and in your relationships. Rather than letting your stress take over your life, try some methods of stress-management that you can apply to prevent and deal with stress before it jeopardizes your health.\n1. Your body has a very efficient reaction to dangerous events that pumps up your \"fight-or-flight\" response, allowing you to jump out of the way of an oncoming car and save your life. This reaction causes your heart to pound, your pulse to quicken, and your muscles to tense. But you may also unconsciously perceive that this reaction is necessary for non-life-threatening situations, such as traffic jams, looming deadlines, or family issues. You must learn ways to counter your body's stress response so that you can \"put the brakes\" on and allow your body to relax.\n2. You may be experiencing unproductive, negative thoughts that lead to worrying, which can trigger the release of stress hormones. This is a response that is appropriate if, say, you run into a stressful situation like a bear in your path, but may not be appropriate when traffic is making you late to work. Identify common stressful thoughts by noticing if they fall into these categories:\n\n\n: You have a strict list of things you \"should,\" \"must,\" or \"should not\" do, and feel stressed out or anxious when you do not follow these rules.\n\n\n: You expect the worst-case scenario or blow things out of proportion. Even small problems are \"horrible\" or a \"disaster.\"\n\n: You see things only in black or white, as good or bad. Instead of acknowledging the complexities (or \"gray areas\") of being human, things are either wrong or right and there is no in between.\n\n: You find yourself having an internal conversation about things you fear, such as \"What if my child is hurt?\" \"What if I fail?\" \"What if I'm late?\" and so on.\n3. Sometimes, a stressful situation is just a matter of perspective. Pessimism, for example, is an excellent example of avoidable stress we put ourselves through. Instead of focusing on the negatives and the problems that are causing you anxiety, concentrate on the positives.\n\nNegative thoughts lead to a negative mood state and positive thoughts lead to a positive mood state. When you feel down, pay attention to your thoughts. What have you been telling yourself? Try to spin negative thoughts into positives.\nFor example, you may think to yourself \"I'll never finish all my work.\" Change this thought by spinning it: \"If I work at a steady pace and take regular breaks, I can knock this work out in __ hours.\"\nWhen you change your viewpoint, you can change your level of stress altogether. Do your best to see things in a positive light, and avoid cynicism at all costs.\n4. Another way to combat stressful thoughts is to ask yourself whether there's really any truth to them. Disputing and disproving your thoughts can help you view your thoughts objectively instead of immediately accepting them as truth.\n5. Make a column for evidence of/for the stressful thought and another for evidence against it. Or, if you don't have paper or time, try to do this exercise mentally.\nWrite the evidence in the appropriate column. So if you're catastrophizing because you've been running late (and you are thinking \"I'm going to be fired\"), your \"for\" column might look like: \"I was late twice last week and they're not going to tolerate me being late again;\" while your \"against\" column might look like: \"My boss said he understands that I have to drop my son off at preschool before I can drive to work,\" \"We have a time and attendance policy that allows me to be late a certain number of times, and I'm nowhere near that point,\" and so on.\n6. Although keeping a journal may seem strange or tedious, writing down your thoughts on a regular basis can help keep you stress-free. When you feel bogged down with some emotional or mental stressor, write about it in your journal. Getting it out on paper will give you a sense of relief you might not otherwise find.\n\nWrite honestly and without fear. Your journal is only for you: no one else needs to read it or see what is stressing you out. It is a safe, judgment-free place to get out all your worries, emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Once your thoughts are down on paper, they will no longer be taking up space in your brain.\nJournaling can help you experience clarity and see the source of your stress.\nWrite out your problems to organize your thoughts. When your thoughts are not organized, you can't think clearly, which leads to confusion and stress. If you have a problem and can't decide between two solutions, make a two-column pros and cons list (for and against), such as dividing a sheet of paper down the center to compare two ways to handle that situation.\n7. You can take steps to reduce your stress and learn how to cope with stress, but you will never be able to completely get rid of stress. Stress serves a purpose as a healthy response to overwhelming stimuli or perceived threats, and it can be dealt with in an equally healthy fashion.\n\nStressors that may be unavoidable include schoolwork and exams, busy days at work, new babies, getting married, or moving. Some of these are actually good things but can still be a source of stress in your life.\nLearning healthy stress management techniques can help you \"turn off\" your stress alarm system so that you are not in a constant state of stress as you move through life.\n8. Seems obvious, right? Sometimes staying away from what is stressing you out is harder than it sounds. If you know a particular person or activity is the origin of your stress, cut them or it out of your life, or limit your exposure as much as possible. This helps to eliminate your stress to a great extent. There are at least seven culprits of unnecessary stress; beware of falling prey to these issues.\n\nStressing about money you have spent (e.g., overspending at the mall, lending money to family or friends, etc.)\nHaving clutter in your home or office space\nBeing pessimistic\nBeing late\nSpending too much time comparing your life to others on social media\nWaiting until the last minute to complete a task\nRuminating about past events\n9. Oftentimes, stress arises from feeling overwhelmed. Use a planner to keep track of your \"to-do lists\". Clean your desk and visit Pinterest to find useful ways to manage your paperwork and household chores. Being organized and getting your priorities straight can help you break responsibilities down into manageable pieces and focus on the things that really matter to you.\n10. You cannot do everything you are asked, so why keep pretending that you can? Indeed, the more you promise and don't deliver, the fewer people will perceive you as being reliable. Instead,  be assertive and learn to say \"no\" politely, but firmly. Keep track of your schedule to clearly acknowledge when you do not have the time or resources to take on extra tasks.\n\nAssertive people maintain eye contact, speak in a clear and non-threatening tone while standing up for themselves. If you know that you are already overbooked, say so. It's okay to say \"no\" when you do it in a way that also respects others.\nSome people take on too much out of fear of missing out on new and exciting opportunities. Yet, they end up not performing as well as they would because they are dividing their energies between so many different tasks or activities. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of new obligations, and decide if the effort will be worth it considering your current workload.\n11. As with trying to do everything, never delegating is about you trying to have control and not trusting that others can do their job as well as you can. Learn to let go by giving more credence to the abilities of others. Giving up tasks may seem stressful in theory but will free you up for more personal time. Find reliable people in your life that you can trust with tasks that you are too stressed or anxious to manage.\n12. Even the most steadfast of souls will waver in an ever-messy environment. If your home, office, car, or workspace is overly messy or dirty, it is certainly having an effect on your mental well-being. Take a few minutes to clean up your most unorganized areas, and your mind will breathe a sigh of relief. Tips for reducing clutter are as follows:\n\nToss items that are rarely used and have no value rather than stockpiling them.\nGather as a team (i.e., spouses, families, or roommates) and take on cleaning together. Group effort makes the process go by quicker and with more fun.\nSort through papers and mail and toss or file as needed. Develop a regular schedule of doing this to prevent papers from piling up.\nDesignate places to store frequently used items so they can be easily retrieved when you need them.\nClean your workspace after each work session to prevent clutter from getting out of hand.\n13. It’s hard to feel prepared for the day when you haven’t taken time to get yourself ready. Spend a few extra minutes in the morning to prepare yourself for the day's events. Take an extra-long shower, put on your favorite outfit, and go into the day ready to take on anything.\n14. Music has shown to have a very strong effect on mood and mental state. Calm yourself down by listening to your favorite soothing music. Although you may prefer heavy metal or rap, try listening to something a bit softer and slower for the best effects. Keeping music playing in the background while you work, study, or just go about your daily activities is a great way to subconsciously alter your stress levels.\nResearchers have found that music can change brain functioning in similar ways as medication. So, regular music really can help to \"cure\" stress and anxiety.\n15. That’s right, what you smell can actually alter your stress levels. Scientific studies have linked the scent of lavender and oranges to reduced stress and anxiety levels. Use a lavender scented air freshener in your home, office, or car, or spritz a bit of an essential oil, like frankincense or chamomile, onto your hair and skin before you head out the door in the morning. You can also dab a bit of the essential oil onto your temples to relieve a stress-induced headache.\n16. If making little changes isn’t enough to cheer you up, try moving to a completely new place for a bit. If work or studying is too difficult in your office or at home, relocate to a cozy coffee shop or a park. Having a new environment will help you to move your thoughts away from your stressors, and give you a chance to breathe and recover from your anxiety.\n17. It's possible the people you talk to are stressors. Don't completely take them out of your life but try meeting some different folks. They can offer a new perspective on things you never even thought about, or get you involved in new stress-reducing activities.\n18. Some people are bath people while others are shower people. No matter which you are, it is hard to deny the comfort of a warm bubble bath with a cozy drink and a good book. If you’re stressed out, try curling up in your bathtub for a while. The warmth will relax your muscles, and help to soothe away your stress.\n19. When we get stressed and anxious, it’s easy to push hobbies to the side and focus on ‘priorities.’ However, by leaving out any free time for yourself, you may be making yourself more stressed. Return to a lost hobby by playing your favorite sport, picking up your art journal, or heading out for a hike. You’ll feel refreshed and better able to deal with your stressors when you’ve given yourself time to do something you love.\n20. If you don’t have any old hobbies that you want to continue, or you never had any in the first place, try out a new activity you’ve been interested in. It’s never too late to learn a new trade. Try auditing a class at a local community college or find other classes in your area. Better yet, teach yourself something new, such as a language or crafting skill, and practice to get better. Learning a new activity forces your mind off of your stressors, making it easier for you to relax.\n21. Sunlight is a natural cure for depression, which is tied to stress and anxiety. Even if you aren’t able to get sunlight, mother nature provides excellent stress relief via the great outdoors. Walk through a park, hike up to a mountain, go for a fishing trip - whatever interests you. It’s hard to be stressed when you’re witnessing the beauty of the natural world while putting your body to work at the same time.\n22. Laughter is the best medicine, so they say. Laughing may seem difficult if you’re stressed and anxious but incorporating it into your life will make a marked difference. Turn on your favorite sitcom, look at funny YouTube videos, or get together with a funny friend. Smiling and laughing release stress-relieving hormones in your brain which will have you feeling better in no time.\n23. Tea-drinkers have shown to be less stressed over time than non-tea drinkers, making this a great activity for reducing stress. Grab a cup of black tea for the best results, but any tea will do. Having the warm cup to hold onto will help you to relax, while the flavor will give you something sweet to focus on.\n24. Massages aren’t just great for your body; they actually release feel-good hormones in your brain as well. The next time you’re feeling stressed, call up your favorite massage therapist and schedule an appointment. Getting your tension worked out of your muscles will help to work the tension out of your mind as well. Better yet? Have a loved one give the massage for you. The combination of your partner or spouse giving you the massage will release extra hormones, practically demolishing whatever stress you had.\n25. You can practice any of the different forms of Yoga for stress relief. Try Hatha yoga, which combines stretching, breathing techniques, and meditation. It soothes your distressed mind, refreshes your thoughts, tones body muscles and generates new awareness like never before.\nYou can make the benefits of yoga last longer when you practice it regularly. Early morning is the perfect time, but you can practice it whenever you feel stressed out. If you are pressed on time, combine it with an exercise routine you are already following as your warmup or cool down practice.\n26. Practicing meditation has proven to relieve stress remarkably. Various meditation patterns can help you get rid of stress and calm your mind for better focus and clear thinking. You can practice either of meditation such as Zen, Tibetan, Transcendental Meditation (TM) irrespective of your religious affiliation.\nIf you are a beginner it’s best to take on a guided meditation program under an expert. You can get a hold of good books and videos on meditation for regular practice.\n27. Few would be surprised to hear that among the myriad benefits healthy eating provides, stress relief is one of them. Don’t let junk food and sugary sweets bog you down and increase your anxiety hormones. Instead, incorporate healthy grains, fruits, and vegetables into your daily diet, and your body will compensate by creating more stress-fighting hormones.\n28. The infamous ‘runners high’ isn’t a phenomenon isolated solely to runners; exerting yourself physically releases endorphins that make you happy. That means that if you’re stressed, you can cheer yourself up and throw your anxiety out the window just by making your heart work a bit harder. Head for a bike ride or swim, pick up some weights, or play your favorite sport to gain both physical and mental health.\n29. When people get stressed and overwhelmed with a million and one things to do, often one of the first things to be sacrificed is sleep. However, this is one of the biggest health mistakes you can make. Getting adequate sleep allows your body to recharge and refresh, leaving you with a clean slate in the morning.\nIf you don’t get enough sleep, your body can’t get rid of the excess hormones and toxins that have built up and cause stress, making your stress a never-ending cycle. Try to get 7-9 hours of sleep on a nightly basis.\n30. If you are in a healthy relationship, try going to your partner for a bit of physical touch. Studies have shown that regular cuddling, kissing, and sex all release oxytocin - a hormone that produces happiness and reduces stress. That’s right - some of your favorite activities actually improve your mental well-being. Do these on a regular basis to keep your hormone levels up in general, making it less likely that you’ll get stressed out in the first place.\n31. A top reason many people participate in religious practices -- to find relief of stress and anxiety. If you are already a part of a religious group, try turning towards it more during your times of stress for its peaceful benefits. It is likely you will find relief with the support of your faith community while growing stronger spiritually simultaneously. \nIf you suffer from chronic stress, consider joining a religious group and see what inner guidance and comfort it has to offer.\n32. It’s easy to get stressed when the people you surround yourself with are unhealthy and co-dependent. Rather than maintaining negative relationships with people that annoy you or cause anxiety, begin to nurture relationships that support you and make you feel better. You’ll feel better in the long run, even if it’s difficult in the short run, to seek and keep happier, healthier friendships in your life.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Reviewer makes an obvious and serious mistake and paper is rejected\n\nLong story short: Submitted a paper to a very respectable (but not TOP) journal in the TCS community. Received 2 reviews. The one was alright, not extremely enthusiastic but a decent review.\nThe problem is with the 2nd one: The reviewer failed in the most obvious way to even understand the statement of the problem, and said that \"I cannot convince myself that the paper is correct\". The misunderstanding is on the definition of the problem.\nfor the TCS people: its a standard resource allocation problem where we want to optimize some objective function. The reviewer's objection is that if we assign the same item multiple times to different users we could achieve a very different objective value thus the analysis on its bounds we give could not possibly be correct! \nThis does not any make sense since on the definition it is said explicitly that each item must be assigned once. In any case, it's the most standard definition of a very well known resource allocation problem! \nAnyway, after the rejection of the paper based on the above reason, I contacted the Editor in Chief of the journal, asking for a 3rd reviewer to resolve the issue (I was not offensive to the 2nd R). The EiC responded immediately saying that a 3rd R could indeed resolve the issue but there is nothing the EiC could do because the handling editor communicated to the EiC that the Com. Editor trusts the expertise of the reviewers, and thus the rejection decision is irrevocable.\nI want to ask: \n\nHow normal is this situation? We are talking about an old and very well respected TCS journal, not some hocus pocus unknown journal.\nIs there any safety net for such kind of obvious mis-managed cases?\nAny particular advice for the incident? I am not very interested in the obvious \"deal with it, it happens\" answer. But observe that I am in a point of my career that an extra journal publication could mean a lot, since I am trying to find a permanent position and I cannot wait another year for this paper to go through such a process.  \n\nNote: I see few people misunderstood my comment. My comment is not targeted to the reviewer who might have made an honest mistake. It happens and I do not blame her/him. My point is mainly on the way the journal handled the situation,  even when the very serious and very easy mistake was brought up to their attention. I was mainly interested if such a reason is valid for straight rejection (usually there is some revision needed which we have the chance to explain to the reviewer and the editor where they have been mistaken), and what to do when this happens. As mentioned again, I do not have 30 journal papers so that I could say this won't make any impact in my CV. I am applying for permanent positions and a +1 (very good) journal might make some difference. Thus my main question: is there any safety net that prevent non-professional editors make such unjustified and arbitrary decisions with such huge impact on us? And how this affect only us as authors? Is there any way to make journals (in general) act more professionally (without making a war against them): sadly, from the comments below, I guess not, besides boycotting the journal, but they couldn't care less.\n\nA:\n\nIt is pretty normal for a reviewer not to get the gist of your article and then the article gets rejected. I find that the best way to deal with that is to remember that the reviewers are reading the article more carefully than the future readers. So if they don't get what I want to write, the future readers are surely not going to get what I want to write. \nSometimes reviewers are just wrong: they are humans too and typically do this with a limited time budget (a larger time budget than future readers will want to spent on your article, but still pretty small).

Depth also had an odd – and unclear – effect; the deeper you went, the longer it took to work in a mine, punishing players who used the same mine for too long of a period.\nThe original, barebones mine interface.\nThe new mine – now available in the Experimental branch – allows players to choose from a variety of strata to mine in – each one offers a unique range of products, from clay in the shallower strata to the potential of discovering entirely new ore veins in the depths.\nThis means that rather than setting and forgetting, you have some choices to make with your mines: They can mine deeper for metal ores, or choose to mine basic raw materials – such as sand – which will always be available in the appropriate stratum should they be needed.\nDeeper strata can only be accessed when a certain mine depth is reached and may require certain modules to unlock. Mine depth is increased by deepening your mine, accomplished at a slow rate by regular mining activity, or much faster by using Mineshaft Digging, a new option which creates no output but rapidly increases depth. The lower depths will require building new modules to be able to access, bringing the module-based gameplay that features so heavily elsewhere properly into the Mine. With this system in place, the Mine is starting to become a much more interesting place to work.\nThere are a few future plans that will really tie the colony together – as part of the Naturalism overhaul, we’ll be changing how survey beacons work and how ores are found, making the two buildings complement each other in what will hopefully be a rather interesting way – more on that later!\nPosted in Clockwork Empires\t| Tagged but even as Gameplay was the foundation of their wealth, it's not a chris blogpost without an animated gif, so also it was their destruction, they delved too greedily and too deep, whose mine?\nI’d be surprised if the lowest levels don’t award some sort of Eldritch Ore or Flesh, with the risk of unleashing heck.\nAs you have added lamps, how about roads? Still a no-no? They would really improve the look of my colonies!\nSo I don’t own the game yet… so could someone explain what the significance of the gif? How does the filling bar relate to the post?\nThere is a colonist in that mineshaft mining, and the job completes when the bar fills up. The colonist will come out with a chunk of ore.\nOh, about how it relates to the post specifically… not sure. Just a final gif showing a new style mineshaft in action?\nLooks good and I have been looking forward to it for a while !", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Wow! We've been working on this game for that long?!\nWe have to start with a huge huge huge thank you. Thank you for believing in us. Thank you for putting your money into a game project from a first time game developer, thank you for believing that we could make this happen, and thank you for entrusting us. A lot has happened in those 4 years!\nWe also want to apologize for the lack of communication and poor timeline execution -- we had to learn the hard way about a lot of the pitfalls of making your own game and we greatly overestimated our skill to amount of time ratio, and ended up falling short of a lot of our projections for release dates. This is something we can only promise to work hard on improving for the future, and we hope you'll continue to support us through our growing pains.\nWe have a lot of news announcements to make so, buckle up.\n1) We will be announcing the release date for 2064: Read Only Memories [JP] in the next 2 weeks.\n2) We will be releasing 2064: Read Only Memories soon on Limited Run Games for PS4. There will be 3 different covers, each with only 2,064 copies of those covers being made. Once they're out, they're out, so you better act fast!\n3) Future Ports: Unfortunately, we have tried and tried and tried to get the game to run on PSVita, but the way we built the original engine was just not made for the amount of memory the system has. As huge fans of Danganronpa and the 999 series, we really understand the value and potential of PSVita and hoped and spent a lot of money and time trying to get this to work, but it just is not meant to be. We are pretty crushed over here too ... In the future, we'll make sure the build our games knowing the limitations of the platforms we're aiming for before making any assumptions if we'll actually be able to execute.\nHowever, the Xbox One port is at 95%, and should be ready to go in the next month. Additionally, the Switch port is about 85% done, and we're looking at a February launch date for that.\nThe Switch version will be called \"2064: Read Only Memories Integral\" and will contain a bunch of fun extras like trailers, art, music and more in a special bonus \"zome\", and will be priced at $20.64 - we also will be looking to do a physical release with Limited Run as well, so please stay tuned.\n3B) We also are hoping to have a mobile version of the game finally ported to iOS and Android for a discounted price around summer, with a few changes to make the game mobile friendly. We know that mobile backers have been extremely patient with us, and we hope we can deliver on this soon. Since most mobile phones actually have far more memory than a PSvita (only 512MB for games!) we feel confident we won't run into the same issues as we did with the Vita.\n4) There will be an update that will be FREE before the end of the year, that includes new voice acting for Dekker, Turing, Lexi, Crow and Gordon, as well as the police ROMs, the hospital ROM and more! Please stay tuned for that - it'll basically complete all of 2064's voice acting and fills in a few of the unvoiced gaps.\n- 2064: ROM release date in Japan to be announced in 2 weeks. Release before end of year.\n-2064: ROM physical release on Limited Run before end of year. 3 Versions/Covers - only 2,064 copies of each will be made!\n- We are still working on 2064: ROM Type:M for iOS and Android and hope to have a version out by summer.\n- All versions of the game will get new voice acting scenes and a few additional bug fixes and content tweaks as a free update before the end of the year.\nAfter all of that... we will be done updating and releasing 2064: Read Only Memories.\nHowever, we have begun work on a new Read Only Memories story, and we believe that those of you who have been with us since the beginning will really appreciate what's next for the world we've created and we really hope you'll stick with us to see what's next.\nPlease hit us up anytime at @rom2064 or @wearemidboss or email us at info@midboss.com at anytime!! We want to talk to you!\nspencivetaylor, Alexandre MANGIN, and 7 more people like this update.\nWhen will you deliver what was promised in this campaign? I paid for the Android version years ago and still NOTHING. You guys are full of air.\nAs a Kickstarter project creator myself it really strikes me and angers me that Kickstarter allows you guys to keep on launching new campaigns when the previous ones haven't been fully delivered.\nIt is because of teams like you that Kickstarter has a bad reputation with a lot of people these days.\n\" In the future, we'll make sure the build our games knowing the limitations of the platforms we're aiming for before making any assumptions if we'll actually be able to execute.\"\nI'm not sure I like the sound of that. Are you saying that you'll deliberately lower the requirements of the project to the lowest common denominator, and then port that onto the more powerful platforms?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I have no idea what use that information would be to you, though. The quotes from textbooks simply reflect reification of IPA transcriptional practice. An affricate has a complete closure (\"a stop\"), and there is a significant release sequence. There are different theories of that later aspect, one being the \"Dummies\" definition which just stipulates the stop-plus-fricative sequence theory (incorrect, in light of Polish stop plus fricative clusters as in [t ʃɨ] vs affricates as in [tʃɨ]), and the Demers et al. definition which points obscurely to the SPE characterization (\"releasing secondarily into a fricative\", overly reifying the consequences of the speed of the release, which SPE sees as being only \"similar to a fricative\").\nThe \"separation between the stop and fricative\" is not a primary fact about the meaning of the term, it is an artifact of particular contemporary ideologies about affricates. You should focus on the meaning (and ideology) surrounding the first use of the word qua linguistic term, in the mid 19th century (as far as I know), which requires knowing who coined the term, and what they were thinking.\nYour question unreasonably assumes that there should be a regular and obvious relationship between the wording of the definition for a technical term in a modern textbook, and the much earlier Latin source. This is contrary to the nature of arcane nomenclature, where you have to know the circumstances surrounding first use (e.g. why is the J(/psi) meson called \"J\"?). The semantic leap from \"rub\" to \"fricative\" is the same in nature as from \"rub against\" to \"affricate\", so you should first attempt to trace these linguistic terms back as far as you can. Reading the early texts where \"fricative\" and \"affricate\" were first introduced (and knowing what impelled the replacement of \"spirant\" with \"fricative\") is important to understanding the semantic leap in question.

Friday was set as the deadline for a response from Tehran.\nThe draft deal, agreed by the US, France and Russia, was prompted by concern over Iran's nuclear programme.\n\"Iran informed the Director General today that it is considering the proposal in depth and in a favourable light, but needs time until the middle of next week to provide a response,\" the IAEA said in a statement.\nIran is giving extremely mixed messages over this important deal and has missed a deadline from the UN to give its verdict. Either Tehran is playing for time or there are genuine differences within the Iranian government.\nAt one stage Iranian state TV said Tehran could not accept a key part of the agreement, shipping the nuclear material out of the country.\nLater Iran told the UN nuclear watchdog that it was considering the plan favourably but needed more time to respond.\nIf the deal does go forward it would provide some evidence that negotiations with Iran can bear fruit, if not then the wider talks process would face a bleak future and new sanctions would once again be on the agenda.\nIt said Mr ElBaradei hoped that Tehran's response \"will equally be positive, since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of co-operation\".\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said: \"We hope that they will next week provide a positive response.\"\nHe added that \"obviously we would have preferred to have a response today [Friday].

{"input": "How has Phish evolved musically since their reunion in 2009?", "output": "Summer is here, and that means jam band stalwarts Phish are back on the road. Since their reunion in 2009, the quartet has consistently shored up its musical footing by increasingly working their way deeper and deeper into jams and pulling out rare tunes. The result is a band that captures the spontaneity of the live music spectacle that so many fans of the genre have been looking for. Phish stopped by Worcester’s DCU Center for a pair of shows last week, the first of which was filled to the brim with great songs and a second set of virtually non-stop improvisation. The result was a show that left fans with everything they were hoping for, and definitely started the tour off on the right foot.\nThe show kicked off with “Buried Alive,” which eventually segued its way into “Runaway Jim,” a reliable jam vehicle throughout the years for Phish. Guitarist Trey Anastasio brought a guitar tone that was slightly sharper than what fans may have been used to, but he used it to great effect, laying down confident licks throughout the entire evening. Although most of this was reserved for the second set, “Jim” did feature a creative tease of “Buried” not minutes after the first song had been performed.\nFrom there, it was a fairly standard first set – songs typically ran about seven minutes, which is a bit short for a band like Phish. The band was more focused on playing a number of beloved tunes instead, it seems. That didn’t deter the audience from having a great time, however. “The Moma Dance” was as funky as it had ever been, complete with crunchy clavichord riffs from keys player Page McConnell.\nIt wasn’t until the second set that things really started to take off, and Phish definitely hit the ground running after the break. “Carini” started off in typical fashion, played cleanly and confidently by the band, and once the jam started, the quartet wasted no time in taking it apart and messing around with various musical ideas. It was the sound of a band clearly happy to be playing with one another and ready to discover new horizons to take songs they’ve been playing for decades. They even segued into a “My Left Toe” jam, which hadn’t happened since 1999!\nFrom there, it was an effortless transition into “Taste,” which doesn’t often show up in the second set. But Phish definitely gave it the second set treatment, opening it up for some unique jams before working their way into the introduction of “Ghost.” Although “Ghost” has been a beloved Phish song for years, the band hasn’t used it for bouts of particularly adventurous improvisation for quite some time. Apparently all that has changed – over the next 15 minutes, Trey propelled the song to brand new sonic boundaries, which the rest of the band happily partook in.\nAfter such furious improvisation, Phish decided to give people a little bit to dance to with a cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Boogie On Reggae Woman.” It’s been a standard of the band’s for years, and was definitely placed perfectly in the set. After playing “If I Could,” Phish dropped into Bob Dylan’s “Quinn The Eskimo.” At about seven minutes, it was easily the shortest tune in the set, but one that set the audience into a wild sing-along.\n“Quinn” would have been a fine place to end the show, but Phish had a little bit more to give the crowd. An immediate drop into “Harry Hood” gave fans yet another lengthy bliss-out, followed by “Cavern,” which ended the show in earnest (Trey dropped into “Buried Alive” one last time just to tie a bow on everything). For an encore, it was the Rolling Stones’ “Loving Cup,” which got everyone in a great mood before heading out of the venue.\nMany were skeptical that Phish would be able to capture the same magic of their live shows that they did throughout the 1990s, but they’ve been improving their playing year after year. With the confidence that only comes from years of experience on the road, 2012 may very well be a year for the ages, especially once they’ve run through their entire summer tour.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain the situation of Russian refugees since the break-up of the Soviet Union.", "output": "The break-up of the USSR left 25 million Russians outside Russia. In many places they are the subject of discrimination and in Ukraine they are the victims of war. Yet in the West, their plight is ignored.\nWhilst the eyes of the world are on the wars in the Middle East and North Africa and the accompanying refugee crisis, there is a silent war and a silent refugee crisis that is being ignored.\nThe war is of course the War in the Donbass region of historic Novorossiya. In a statement from 31st July released by the Defence Ministry of the Donetsk People’s Republic, there have been 817 new bombardments from Kiev’s military and paramilitaries in the past day alone. Homes have been destroyed and civilian casualties have occurred.\nThese bombardments like previous ones are in total violation of the internationally sanctioned Minsk Agreement of 2015. The war continues yet coverage has greatly ceased. The only irony of this tragic situation is that by insisting on the preservation of the even then uneasy borders of pre-coup d’etat Ukraine, western leaders are actually enforcing the arbitrary borders of a state originally created as a Soviet Republic in the aftermath of the October Revolution. The principle of national self-determination seems to fall on deaf ears whilst the bombs keep falling on innocent civilians.\nBut this raises an even broader issue, one that has existed since 1991. Conservative figures state that over 25 million Russian people find themselves refugees. These are people who went to sleep in a country where their rights were constitutionally protected and woke up in a foreign land, often as persons without status/non-citizens. They were of course given a say in the Soviet Referendum of 1991 in which the vast majority of Soviet citizens voted to remain part of the Soviet Union. But in spite of this, their pleas were ignored and the leaders of only three Soviet republics agreed to unilaterally dismember the state during a secret meeting in Belavezha Forest…..Soviexit through the back door.\nThe situation of Russians living in foreign lands persists and the rest of the world doesn’t seem to care. During the 1990s the Russian government didn’t particularly care either. Whilst under Putin and Medvedev steps have been taken to help the Russian refugees, more action should be taken and the process should be simplified. Anyone who is a Russian person ought to have the right to citizenship of the Russian federation. The process should be simple since the issue is straightforward. Far from antagonising the states where these Russians have been displaced, if these states find the presence of Russian people so deeply distasteful, this should be all the more reason for such states to cooperate with Russia in this matter, including in respect of financial compensation given directly to affected individuals.\nOf course for those Russians who want to remain outside of the Russian Federation (a home is a home after all, in many cases) international bodies should insure the removal of any legal discrimination and cooperate on ending any ethnic tensions. This is based on the most fundamental principles of humanity. Unlike other waves of refugees, the Russian refugees did not flee their homes, they had their country ripped out from beneath them. They are owed better and all states should cooperate in this matter for the benefit of all.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What can you tell me about holy water? Respond in 29 sentences.", "output": "It used to be said that the priest “made” holy water; he did not simply bless it. The rite is still in the Roman Ritual. The priest makes holy water by adding exorcized salt to exorcized water.\nHoly water, in this rite, is understood as a pure creature directly conveying the power of God. Hence, both salt and water must first be exorcized, on the grounds that the Fall reverberated throughout all of material creation, giving Satan a dominion even over lifeless elements.\nThe holy water in churches today, I believe, is typically blessed not made, the priest saying a prayer of blessing and making a sign of the cross over it, often in the context of Mass.\nSurely not on the minimalist grounds that the grace of Christ is sufficient, because then the argument for having holy water at all would be taken away. Moreover, Christ is a mediator, after all, who in his life on earth showed a strong liking for working through mediating matter, such as spittle and dirt.\nRather, from experience I know that blessed water works very effectively against the devil.\nMany friends have told me the same thing. They were troubled at night by twisted dreams, for instance – and after they began sprinkling holy water on the bed each night, and said a Hail Mary or three, the problem vanished and never returned. Something my own life experiences tend to corroborate.\nMany of the friends I’ve mentioned, naturally enough, do not omit holy water when tucking in their children. But this leads to another reason for praising it, beyond its utility, namely, how attractive it is to children and child-like adults.\nAs children we marvel at bells, smoke, fire. The Church is right to appeal to our senses in this way. But consider that water, like fire, is not “supposed” to be within buildings. So even a small votive candle – that little point of brilliant fire, guarded by the wax but dangerous if it were to break out – can signify something transcendent, prayer ascending to God and light descending.\nFor a similar reason, we lean forward to get sprinkled with Holy Water on Easter Sunday, and we like to dip our fingers in the holy water font. As the water is not where it is “supposed” to be, it easily signifies inflowing grace from God, while it should lead us to consider our own baptism and the purifying efficacy of sacramental confession.\nThe family is a domestic church, not on its own, but as participating in the life of the Church. That little bottle of holy water in the household, then, testifies to the reality of Holy Orders and the power of the Church in the sacraments.\nAs holy water is held to be precious, and it comes solely from the priest, the priesthood is honored by it. As we get holy water freely – we need only bring a bottle to the church and fill it – it teaches that the most precious things in life have no price. They are freely given by God, if we simply look for them in the right place.\nFinally, as water is an element, and holy water is a blessed element, it testifies to the goodness of creation, how grace completes nature, and the logic of the Incarnation.\nThere is a catechism contained in holy water. Alternatively, we can say that the true Church would, of course, have devised it. Alternatively, as truth is overdetermined by evidence, we can also say that the existence and use of holy water, like forty other things, is almost on its own a reason to become a Catholic.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Why would a landlord put the following in a residential rental agreement?\n\nI saw the following in a rental agreement: \n\nLegal Proceedings: Landlord and Tenant agree that any action or\n  proceeding arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement,\n  regardless of whether such claim is based on contract, tort or other\n  legal theory, shall be heard by a court sitting without a jury and\n  thus Tenant hereby waives all rights to a trial by jury.\n\nThis was written by a property management company. My guess is that they want:\n\nTo avoid a jury that might be personally prejudiced against landlords or property management companies. \nAn economic advantage in court. The Landlord presumably can afford better lawyers than the Tenant, so they want the Tenant to have no advantage. \nThe jury might find the rental agreement confusing, so they might misunderstand the problem, whereas a judge would be better able to decide because of their legal background. \n\nIs this a good intuition? Are there other reasons they would put that clause in a residential rental agreement? ", "output": "None of the three factors you identify is correct.\nWith respect to reason (1):\nThe belief that a judge is likely to be landlord friendly on the merits, while a factor favoring a bench trial is actually a pretty minor one. \nEmpirically, actual outcomes on the merits are far less different between jury trials and bench trials than you might expect. There aren't a lot of \"moving parts\" in a typical landlord-tenant case that afford the trier of fact much discretion. Usually there is evidence quantifying the amount of damage to the property in dollar terms and the amount of rent owed is usually just math. \nIt isn't like a personal injury case where pain and suffering damages are highly subjective and even liability which hinges on a common sense assessment of what constitutes \"reasonable case\" is very vague. \nThere may be some wiggle room in a landlord-tenant case to disagree on the credibility of witnesses and to differ in opinion regarding what constitutes \"reasonable wear and tear\", but the differences in litigation costs between a jury and bench trial will usually be greater in magnitude than the differences in outcomes on the merits between the two.\nOf course, in the rare case where the tenant is suing the landlord for a personal injury on the premises, the difference in outcome on the merits does matter quite a bit and a judge is much less likely to enter an extremely tenant favorable damages award than a jury is to do so. But, usually, lawyers for landlords aren't thinking about this scenario very much when they write a lease because it doesn't come up very often.\nWith respect to reason (2):\nThe landlord actually probably has a procedural advantage over the tenant in a jury trial where having a lawyer is more important than a bench trial, but this is pretty irrelevant, because landlords are overwhelmingly more likely to win than the tenant anyway. It isn't hard to prove that somebody didn't pay all of the rent that was owed, or that they damaged the premises. Landlords care more about litigation costs than they do about their odds of winning on the merits.\nWith respect to reason (3):\nAnd, the judge interprets of rental agreement for the jury - the jury only decides the factual issues that are disputed with regard to the rental agreement as the judge explains what it means to them. So, confusion isn't a major concern either.\nInstead, the biggest factors are timing and litigation costs.\nA jury trial is longer, because it takes time to select a jury, to prepare jury instructions, to instruct the jury, and for the jury to deliberate. A landlord-tenant bench trial might be half a day or one day long, while a jury trial on the same matter might take two or three days. Selecting and charging a jury alone takes about half a day, and instructing a jury and having it deliberate takes another half-day at least.\nThe longer duration of a jury trial means that it takes longer for a case before a jury to be scheduled than a bench trial, because there in any given time frame, there will be more slots available for short trials than long ones. A half day bench trial might be possible to schedule two or three months out, while a two or three day jury trial might not fit into a judge's calendar for five or six months.\nAnd, a lawsuit involving a jury trial is more expensive to conduct. It probably takes something on the order of 32 more hours of lawyer time to litigate a case that goes to a jury trial than a case set for a bench trial, which is on the order of $8,000 at $250 per hour. Generally, a tenant who is being evicted or owes rent is either judgment-proof, or at least hard to collect from, so the landlord has an interest in keeping litigation costs low. \nThe out of pocket costs other than attorney's fees are also higher in a jury trial - there is typically a jury demand fee and a need to prepare a juror notebook for each juror. The need for better quality exhibits (e.g. exhibits may need to be blown up and put on an easel, or made into a powerpoint that can be see by all the jurors, rather than just photocopied and put in a single binder for a judge).", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Can you provide 28 clear and concise instructions on how to style wet hair?", "output": "On those days when you’re running late, you don’t always have enough time to wash, blow dry, and style your hair how you normally would. When you’re on the go but still need to make your wet hair look presentable, fashion your hair in some simple and easy hairstyles that take minutes to put up.\n1. A detangler will help lubricate knots and tangles so you can run your fingers through your hair easily. Hold the detangling spray about 6 inches (15 centimeters) away from your hair, and spray about 4 to 6 squirts onto your hair. You may consider spraying a few more squirts if your hair is long or has a lot of texture.\nBe sure to spray not only the top layers of your hair, but also the under layers as well.\n2. When most of the tangles are removed, brush your hair back, and up into a high ponytail position at the crown of your head. You can use your fingers to smooth out your hair if it is very wet.\nUse the brush to smooth out any bumps and incorporate loose hairs into your beginning ponytail.\n3. Use a hair tie to secure your high ponytail. Twist it around your hair as many times as necessary to hold it in place, but avoid making it tighter than necessary. When your ponytail is tied, run your fingers through the ponytail to smooth out your hair.\nIf your ponytail looks too tight, you can gently tug some hairs forward from the ponytail to loosen the look.\n4. Twist the ponytail in one direction, starting at the base of the ponytail and continuing down to the ends. When you get to the ends of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist around itself. Following the natural twist, wrap the ponytail around the hair tie to create a twisted bun.\n5. When you’re finished wrapping the ponytail and have a twisted bun, hold the ends of your hair in place. Secure the ends of the ponytail with a bobby pin. Push a bobby pin over the ends and through, to the center of the bun.\nYou may want to add a few more bobby pins around the bun for extra hold.\n6. Gently spray the top of your hair with hairspray to keep everything in place and tame flyaway hairs. Softly run your hands over your hair to smooth your hair back.\nConsider spraying behind your head to keep any shorter back airs from falling out of your bun.\n7. Use your fingers or a comb to part your hair down the center of your head. Then pull back a section from the top on each side of your center part to create two side parts extending to the backs of both your ears. Clip these two side sections of hair so they stay out of the way.\n8. With the section of your hair (the section in the middle of the back of your head that you have not clipped up yet), create two even ponytails a little bit above the nape of your neck. Tie these ponytails very close together in the middle of your head, so you can’t see the part separating them.\nUse small, thin, elastic hair ties to tie these ponytails.\n9. Twist each ponytail one at a time, twisting from the base of the ponytail down to the ends. When you get to the end of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist and wrap around itself. Wrap the ponytail around its base and tuck the ends into the elastic hair tie.\nTwist and wrap the other ponytail around its base and secure it, so you have two, small buns right next to each other.\n10. Unclip the two side sections of your hair, and twist back one section at a time, starting from your forehead. Continue to twist the hair back towards the two small buns. Lay the twisted side section over the top of the two buns, and wrap it underneath if your hair is long enough.\nTwist the other side section of your hair, and again, lay that section over the top of the two buns, overlapping the first twisted side section.\n11. When your two side sections are both twisted and wrapped around the two small buns, secure them with a few bobby pins.\n12. Gather all of your hair from the ends and hold it in both of your hands. Push your gathered hair up from the bottom, so your hair falls to the sides and creates your natural part. Use your fingers to smooth out your part and add any stray hairs to the correct side of the part.\n13. When your hair is parted down its natural part, shake your hands through the ends of your hair to break up pieces of hair that are stuck together and give your hair some texture.\nIf you want to, you can also work a small amount of mousse through the middle and ends of your hair for added texture.\n14. Use both hands to stretch out an elastic headband and place it on top of your hair, as if you were putting on a hat. Adjust the front, top portion of the headband so it sits where you’d like it, and be sure to keep the back, bottom portion of the headband over your hair.\n15. When your headband is in place, take small sections of the end pieces of your hair, wrap them over the headband, and tuck them in to the elastic. Consider starting from the center of the back of your head, and working your way outward, toward your ears.\n\nThe tucks don’t have to be perfectly symmetrical. When the tucks are uneven (tighter tucks, looser tucks), it gives your hairstyle some pretty texture.\nIf you have shorter hair that can’t tuck all the way into the elastic headband, use bobby pins to secure any loose pieces of hair.\n16. Create a center part through your hair by dragging the first tooth of a comb down the middle of your scalp. Be sure that the part goes directly through the middle of your head.\n17. Spray a small amount of a shine-enhancing product through your hair and comb it through from the roots of your hair to the ends. If your hair is thicker or wavy, you can rub in a small amount of flexible gel throughout your hair.\nThe shine spray or flexible gel will add a glossy look and little bit of hold to your hair. This will help your ponytail look as sleek as possible.\n18. Gather all of your hair at the nape of your neck. Use an elastic hair tie to secure your hair. As you are making your ponytail, only pull half of your ponytail through the last rotation of the elastic hair tie.This will form a loop in your hair, with the ends of your hair near the bottom of the ponytail base.\nYou should have about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of hair hanging out from the loop.\n19. Hold onto the loop with one hand, and wrap the ends of your hair around the base of the ponytail to cover up the elastic hair tie. Push about two or three bobby pins into the wrapped ends and underneath the elastic hair tie.\nCrisscrossing the bobby pins over each other adds extra hold.\n20. Finish your hairstyle by lightly misting on some shine spray. Run your hands over the surface of your hair to even out any frizz. This style looks best the shinier and sleeker you make your hair.\n21. Add in some hair product to help manage your strands as you’re braiding. The right product for you will depend on the texture of your hair. If you have fine and soft hair, spray a little bit of shine spray all over. If your hair is a bit thicker, wavy, and coarse, add in a small amount of cream or gel.\n22. Pull all of your hair back so it lays behind your shoulders and separate your hair into four equal sections: one section on each side and two equal sections in the back. It may be easier to remember the braiding pattern if you number the strands of hair  from the left.\n23. With your four sections of hair separated, take your right hand and grab the second section of hair from the left, section 2. Cross it all the way over to the right, over the other two sections of hair, sections 3 and 4. Keep holding that section of hair, section 2, over to the right.\n\nTake the remaining two sections on the left side of your head, sections 3 and 1, and twist them so section 3 twists over section 1, and section 3 is the new leftmost section of hair.\nMirror and repeat this process from the right side of your head: Take the second section of hair from the right, section 4, and cross it over the two left side sections of hair, sections 3 and 1. Keep holding section 4 all the way over to the left.\nTake the remaining two sections of hair that are on the right side, section 1 and section 2, and twist them so section 1 twists over section 2.\nAs you braid, your hair will begin to look like rope. Keep braiding in this fashion until you reach the ends of your hair.\n24. Tie the end of your braid with a small elastic hair tie. Then finish the look by spritzing on some shine spray.\nIf the section underneath the base of the braid starts to droop and sag down, slide some bobby pins underneath the braid to tidy up the look of the braid.\n25. If it's very cold outside, wet hair can actually freeze, which can cause breakage. To avoid this, make sure to get your hair reasonably dry before going out when it's below freezing.\n26. If you're accustomed to wrapping your hair in a cotton towel, you may be causing damage to your hair without even knowing it. Try swapping out your towel for a microfiber one, which will be much gentler on wet hair.\nGently patting your hair with the towel instead of wrapping it will also help prevent damage.\n27. Hair is at its weakest and most vulnerable when it is wet, so avoid using your regular brush to detangle wet strands. Instead, separate your strands with your fingers, or if necessary, with a wide-toothed comb. This will cause much less damage to your hair.\n28. Tying your hair back with hair ties can also cause damage if you're not careful. Be sure to choose the right kind of hair ties and try to keep your hair bands a little loose, especially when your hair is wet.\n\nNever use rubber bands to tie back your hair, as these can cause a lot of damage.\n\nAlways use seamless ponytail holders to avoid snagging your hair.\nYou put a lot of stress on certain sections of your hair when you tie it up in the same style frequently. Try switching up your style frequently to avoid damage.\nHair ties cause even more damage to hair when it is very wet. Ideally, you should not use hair ties until your hair has dried at least somewhat. Tying up damp hair is fine. If you don't have time to dry your hair at all, you may want to consider using clips and bobby pins to hold your hair back instead of elastic ties.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain why cathedrals need reform and how it should be done. Respond in 471 words.", "output": "THE hastily produced Cathedrals report that is now being rushed through the General Synod is based on a misconception about what a cathedral should be. For the compilers of the report, cathedrals are a “success” story, a trusted “brand”. But the financial crisis at Peterborough triggered panic on high, and a determination to bring cathedrals under wider control (News, 7 October 2016).\nGovernance and day-to-day management are to be separated, and deans and canons will form a minority on chapter (News, 15 June). This ends the comparative independence that cathedrals have enjoyed. The new order reflects the old Evangelical obsession with headship: all must be “led”. So the bishop will now be the Head Honcho (the one who “gathers and sends”, according to a cleverly tailored bit of ecclesiology); the dean is CEO; and the canons his or her subordinates. Musicians, architects, and craftsmen are ignored as no more than hired functionaries.\nAs so often in current church thinking, there seems little awareness of history. Our historic cathedrals are expressions of a delicate ecology which goes back to monastic rules, mainly Benedictine. Their principal position is the opus dei, the daily offering of prayer and worship. The independence of cathedrals at the Reformation enabled the emergence of the English choral tradition and the fine choirs that still draw the crowds on big occasions.\nIt is the God-centred dedication of clerks — clergy and lay — which makes cathedrals what they are. The bishop is guest, not host, in this house of God. It could be said that the proper function of cathedrals is to keep bishops honest by reminding them that they depend on a rhythm of prayer that they do not control.\nAlthough the report is bad news for cathedrals, I have sympathy with some of its concerns. I have been involved with six very different cathedrals over the years. The truth is, there are ineffective deans who preside over chaos, and there are prima donnas among cathedral clergy.\nBut there are also chapters where the members actually like each other; deans who are both highly competent and courageous, unafraid to speak truth to power. The ecology derived from monastic rules is designed to enable levels of trust and candour far beyond those that the report deems possible.\nEven so, musicians are rarely integrated as they should be. The new arrangements can make this only worse. Suppose the cathedral is required to adopt a money-making strategy that prioritises selling the cathedral space for evening functions: this means cutting back on regular evensongs. Several lay clerks are sacked. Gifted musicians see the way the wind is blowing, and look for other jobs.\nGradually, the ecology on which the Christmas music depends is destroyed, killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.\nCathedrals need reform, but they first need to be understood.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Procedural modeling describes a set of techniques used to allow computers to generate digital content such as 3D digital models automatically. However, procedural modeling to date has focused on very specific areas: natural scenery such as trees and terrain, or cityscapes such as road maps and buildings. While these types of models are important and useful, they focus on a specific subset of the procedural modeling problem. Though procedural generation can be an invaluable tool for providing viable and dynamic content, it is troubling that so few types of objects have been studied in this area.

No diré que el tiempo se ha perdido, pero no vacilo en afirmar que no estamos suficientemente informados, ni ustedes ni nosotros, de los conocimientos y las conciencias que debiéramos tener para enfrentar las realidades que nos desafían. Lo primero a tomar en cuenta es que nuestras vidas son una fracción histórica de segundo, que hay que compartir además con las necesidades vitales de todo ser humano. Una de las características de este es la tendencia a la sobrevaloración de su papel, lo cual contrasta por otro lado con el número extraordinario de personas que encarnan los sueños más elevados. \n  \n Nadie, sin embargo, es bueno o es malo por sí mismo. Ninguno de nosotros está diseñado para el papel que debe asumir en la sociedad revolucionaria. En parte, los cubanos tuvimos el privilegio de contar con el ejemplo de José Martí. Me pregunto incluso si tenía que caer o no en Dos Ríos, cuando dijo “para mí es hora”, y cargó contra las fuerzas españolas atrincheradas en una sólida línea de fuego. No quería regresar a Estados Unidos y no había quién lo hiciera regresar. Alguien arrancó algunas hojas de su diario. ¿Quién cargó con esa pérfida culpa, que fue sin duda obra de algún intrigante inescrupuloso? Se conocen diferencias entre los Jefes, pero jamás indisciplinas. “Quien intente apropiarse de Cuba recogerá el polvo de su suelo anegado en sangre, si no perece en la lucha”, declaró el glorioso líder negro Antonio Maceo. Se reconoce igualmente en Máximo Gómez, el jefe militar más disciplinado y discreto de nuestra historia. \n  \n Mirándolo desde otro ángulo, cómo no admirarse de la indignación de Bonifacio Byrne cuando, desde la distante embarcación que lo traía de regreso a Cuba, al divisar otra bandera junto a la de la estrella solitaria, declaró: “Mi bandera es aquella que no ha sido jamás mercenaria…”, para añadir de inmediato una de las más bellas frases que escuché nunca: “Si deshecha en menudos pedazos llega a ser mi bandera algún día… ¡nuestros muertos alzando los brazos la sabrán defender todavía!...”. Tampoco olvidaré las encendidas palabras de Camilo Cienfuegos aquella noche, cuando a varias decenas de metros bazucas y ametralladoras de origen norteamericano, en manos contrarrevolucionarias, apuntaban hacia la terraza donde estábamos parados. Obama había nacido en agosto de 1961, como él mismo explicó. Más de medio siglo transcurriría desde aquel momento. \n  \n Veamos sin embargo cómo piensa hoy nuestro ilustre visitante: \n  \n “Vine aquí para dejar atrás los últimos vestigios de la guerra fría en las Américas. Vine aquí extendiendo la mano de amistad al pueblo cubano”. \n  \n De inmediato un diluvio de conceptos, enteramente novedosos para la mayoría de nosotros: \n  \n “Ambos vivimos en un nuevo mundo colonizado por europeos”. Prosiguió el Presidente norteamericano. “Cuba, al igual que Estados Unidos, fue constituida por esclavos traídos de África; al igual que Estados Unidos, el pueblo cubano tiene herencias en esclavos y esclavistas”. \n  \n Las poblaciones nativas no existen para nada en la mente de Obama. Tampoco dice que la discriminación racial fue barrida por la Revolución; que el retiro y el salario de todos los cubanos fueron decretados por esta antes de que el señor Barack Obama cumpliera 10 años. La odiosa costumbre burguesa y racista de contratar esbirros para que los ciudadanos negros fuesen expulsados de centros de recreación fue barrida por la Revolución Cubana. Esta pasaría a la historia por la batalla que libró en Angola contra el apartheid, poniendo fin a la presencia de armas nucleares en un continente de más de mil millones de habitantes. No era ese el objetivo de nuestra solidaridad, sino ayudar a los pueblos de Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau y otros del dominio colonial fascista de Portugal. \n  \n En 1961, apenas dos años y tres meses después del Triunfo de la Revolución, una fuerza mercenaria con cañones e infantería blindada, equipada con aviones, fue entrenada y acompañada por buques de guerra y portaviones de Estados Unidos, atacando por sorpresa a nuestro país. Nada podrá justificar aquel alevoso ataque que costó a nuestro país cientos de bajas entre muertos y heridos. De la brigada de asalto proyanki, en ninguna parte consta que se hubiese podido evacuar un solo mercenario. Aviones yankis de combate fueron presentados ante Naciones Unidas como equipos cubanos sublevados. \n  \n Es de sobra conocida la experiencia militar y el poderío de ese país. En África creyeron igualmente que la Cuba revolucionaria sería puesta fácilmente fuera de combate. El ataque por el Sur de Angola por parte de las brigadas motorizadas de Sudáfrica racista los lleva hasta las proximidades de Luanda, la capital de este país. Ahí se inicia una lucha que se prolongó no menos de 15 años. No hablaría siquiera de esto, a menos que tuviera el deber elemental de responder al discurso de Obama en el Gran Teatro de La Habana Alicia Alonso. \n  \n No intentaré tampoco dar detalles, solo enfatizar que allí se escribió una página honrosa de la lucha por la liberación del ser humano. De cierta forma yo deseaba que la conducta de Obama fuese correcta. Su origen humilde y su inteligencia natural eran evidentes. Mandela estaba preso de por vida y se había convertido en un gigante de la lucha por la dignidad humana. Un día llegó a mis manos una copia del libro en que se narra parte de la vida de Mandela y ¡oh, sorpresa!: estaba prologado por Barack Obama. Lo ojeé rápidamente. Era increíble el tamaño de la minúscula letra de Mandela precisando datos. Vale la pena haber conocido hombres como aquel. \n  \n Sobre el episodio de Sudáfrica debo señalar otra experiencia. Yo estaba realmente interesado en conocer más detalles sobre la forma en que los sudafricanos habían adquirido las armas nucleares. Solo tenía la información muy precisa de que no pasaban de 10 o 12 bombas. Una fuente segura sería el profesor e investigador Piero Gleijeses, quien había redactado el texto de “Misiones en conflicto: La Habana, Washington y África 1959-1976”; un trabajo excelente. Yo sabía que él era la fuente más segura de lo ocurrido y así se lo comuniqué; me respondió que él no había hablado más del asunto, porque en el texto había respondido a las preguntas del compañero Jorge Risquet, quien había sido embajador o colaborador cubano en Angola, muy amigo suyo. Localicé a Risquet; ya en otras importantes ocupaciones estaba terminando un curso del que le faltaban varias semanas. Esa tarea coincidió con un viaje bastante reciente de Piero a nuestro país; le había advertido a este que Risquet tenía ya algunos años y su salud no era óptima. A los pocos días ocurrió lo que yo temía. Risquet empeoró y falleció. Cuando Piero llegó no había nada que hacer excepto promesas, pero ya yo había logrado información sobre lo que se relacionaba con esa arma y la ayuda que Sudáfrica racista había recibido de Reagan e Israel. \n  \n No sé qué tendrá que decir ahora Obama sobre esta historia. Ignoro qué sabía o no, aunque es muy dudoso que no supiera absolutamente nada. Mi modesta sugerencia es que reflexione y no trate ahora de elaborar teorías sobre la política cubana. \n  \n Hay una cuestión importante: \n  \n Obama pronunció un discurso en el que utiliza las palabras más almibaradas para expresar: “Es hora ya de olvidarnos del pasado, dejemos el pasado, miremos el futuro, mirémoslo juntos, un futuro de esperanza. Y no va a ser fácil, va a haber retos, y a esos vamos a darle tiempo; pero mi estadía aquí me da más esperanzas de lo que podemos hacer juntos como amigos, como familia, como vecinos, juntos”. \n  \n Se supone que cada uno de nosotros corría el riesgo de un infarto al escuchar estas palabras del Presidente de Estados Unidos. Tras un bloqueo despiadado que ha durado ya casi 60 años, ¿y los que han muerto en los ataques mercenarios a barcos y puertos cubanos, un avión de línea repleto de pasajeros hecho estallar en pleno vuelo, invasiones mercenarias, múltiples actos de violencia y de fuerza? \n  \n Nadie se haga la ilusión de que el pueblo de este noble y abnegado país renunciará a la gloria y los derechos, y a la riqueza espiritual que ha ganado con el desarrollo de la educación, la ciencia y la cultura. \n  \n Advierto además que somos capaces de producir los alimentos y las riquezas materiales que necesitamos con el esfuerzo y la inteligencia de nuestro pueblo. No necesitamos que el imperio nos regale nada. Nuestros esfuerzos serán legales y pacíficos, porque es nuestro compromiso con la paz y la fraternidad de todos los seres humanos que vivimos en este planeta. \n  \n Fidel Castro Ruz \n  \n Marzo 27 de 2016 \n  \n 10 y 25 p.m. ||||| Fidel Castro responded Monday to President Barack Obama's historic trip to Cuba with a long, bristling letter recounting the history of U.S. aggression against Cuba, writing that \"we don't need the empire to give us any presents.\" \n  \n The 1,500-word letter in state media titled \"Brother Obama\" was Castro's first response to the president's three-day visit last week, in which the American president said he had come to bury the two countries' history of Cold War hostility. Obama did not meet with the 89-year-old Fidel Castro on the trip but met several times with his 84-year-old brother Raul Castro, the current Cuban president. \n  \n Obama's visit was intended to build irreversible momentum behind his opening with Cuba and to convince the Cuban people and the Cuban government that a half-century of U.S. attempts to overthrow the Communist government had ended, allowing Cuban to reform its economy and political system without the threat of U.S. interference. \n  \n Fidel Castro writes of Obama: \"My modest suggestion is that he reflects and doesn't try to develop theories about Cuban politics.\" \n  \n Castro, who led Cuba for decades before handing power to his brother in 2008, was legendary for his hours-long, all-encompassing speeches. His letter reflects that style, presenting a sharp contrast with Obama's tightly focused speech in Havana. Castro's letter opens with descriptions of environmental abuse under the Spaniards and reviews the historical roles of Cuban independence heroes Jose Marti, Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomez. \n  \n Castro then goes over crucial sections of Obama's speech line by line, engaging in an ex-post-facto dialogue with the American president with pointed critiques of perceived slights and insults, including Obama's failure to give credit to indigenous Cubans and Castro's prohibition of racial segregation after coming to power in 1959. \n  \n Quoting Obama's declaration that \"it is time, now, for us to leave the past behind,\" the man who shaped Cuba during the second half of the 20th century writes that \"I imagine that any one of us ran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the President of the United States.\" \n  \n Castro then returns to a review of a half-century of U.S. aggression against Cuba. Those events include the decades-long U.S. trade embargo against the island; the 1961 Bay of Pigs attack and the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner backed by exiles who took refuge in the U.S. \n  \n He ends with a dig at the Obama administration's drive to increase business ties with Cuba. The Obama administration says re-establishing economic ties with the U.S. will be a boon for Cuba, whose centrally planned economy has struggled to escape from over-dependence on imports and a chronic shortage of hard currency. \n  \n The focus on U.S-Cuba business ties appears to have particularly rankled Castro, who nationalized U.S. companies after coming to power in 1959 and establishing the communist system into which his brother is now introducing gradual market-based reforms. \n  \n \"No one should pretend that the people of this noble and selfless country will renounce its glory and its rights,\" Fidel Castro wrote. \"We are capable of producing the food and material wealth that we need with work and intelligence of our people.\" \n  \n ——— \n  \n Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein |||||\"\nIn this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.", "output": "No one expected President Obama to meet with Fidel Castro during his historic visit to Cuba last week. But while Obama was chatting up and taking in a baseball game with brother Raul Castro, the 89-year-old former revolutionary was penning what the AP calls a \"long, bristling letter.\" \"We don't need the empire to give us any presents,\" Fidel writes in the 1,500-word missive Monday in El Granma, the newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, per Politico. In his \"El Hermano Obama\" (\"Brother Obama\") essay, Castro launches into a Cuban history primer, including Spanish colonialism, then addresses its interactions with the US, such as the doomed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, US trade embargo against Cuba, and Obama's relative youth—all in what the AP calls reminiscent of the lengthy, \"all-encompassing\" speeches Castro used to deliver. Going over Obama's speech with a fine-toothed comb, Castro rails against his rival's supposed insults and rolls his eyes at Obama's statement that \"it is time, now, for us to leave the past behind.\" \"I imagine that any one of us ran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the President of the United States,\" Castro writes. Moving onto the Bay of Pigs, he notes, \"Nothing can justify this premeditated attack that cost our country hundreds of killed and wounded.\" And as for Obama speaking at all about Cuba and its people, Castro offers this dig: \"Native populations do not exist at all in the minds of Obama. Nor does he say that racial discrimination was swept away by the Revolution; that retirement and salary of all Cubans were enacted by this before Mr. Barack Obama was 10 years old.\" He gives a final piece of advice to Obama: \"My modest suggestion is to reflect and do not try now to develop theories about Cuban politics.\"", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I was the support programmer for the overall project, responsible for the “shell”, including the intros, titlepage, menus, cut-scenes, and various other tools and stuff. I also wrote the code that glued the two separate games together, and all the Sega CD disc loading and IO stuff.

{"input": "Describe how Reflections studio is at the forefront of the modular approach to game development.", "output": "Spend any time with your grandparents and at some stage the age-old phase “they don’t make them like they use to” will pop up as nostalgia gets the better of them. Usually it’s just the rose-tinted glasses talking, but for video games it’s a fact: they quite literally don’t make them like they used to.\nBack in the 1980s, when the industry was in its infancy, games were often created by two-person teams consisting of one programmer and one artist. In the 1990s, sprites gave way to 3D modelling, and development teams mushroomed in size, hoovering up specialists in disciplines across animation, level design, character modelling and artificial intelligence.\nToday, creating the most advanced, triple-A games has become too big a task for a single developer leading to the rise of what is best described as a modular approach, where different developers work on different parts of a single game.\nOne developer that is pioneering the modern modular approach is no spring chicken. Set up in 1984, Newcastle-based Reflections swiftly established a reputation for bringing cutting-edge graphics to side-scrollers such as Shadow of the Beast and the gloriously named Brian the Lion. It then morphed into a driving-game specialist, thanks primarily to the Destruction Derby and Driver franchises.\nFrench publisher Ubisoft acquired the studio in 2006, expanding its remit way beyond its previous practice of churning out a new Driver game every three years or so.\nReflections is crafting the vehicle components of the upcoming Watch Dogs 2 and Ghost Recon Wildlands and has just finished the Underground downloadable content (DLC) pack for The Division. It’s finishing Grow Up, the sequel to 2015’s Grow Home – ironically, a small, innovative download game made by a 90s-style 10-person team.\nPlus, it built roughly the half of the virtual Manhattan featured inThe Division, along with six of its story missions and various bits of the user interface. In recent years, it has worked on Ubisoft games as diverse as Assassin’s Creed Syndicate and Just Dance.\nReflections managing director Pauline Jacquey, a French native, identifies several upsides to the modular development approach, having introduced two extra “pillars”: the small incubator that created Grow Home and Grow Up, and the level-design and general action-adventure expertise, as seen in The Division – to the developer’s driving-game skills.\nJacquey acknowledges it is unhealthy for a developer to feel its future depends on a single three-year project, like 2011’s Driver: San Francisco: “Driver: San Francisco was not the commercial success we wanted it to be – it was a success, but not enough to cover the spending on it. It led the team to feel a bit that if it failed, it was a big catastrophe, and I worked really, really hard to make them understand that it’s OK to fail.\nNo such quasi-slavery on Jacquey’s watch: “I would hate to run a company where everybody feels it’s like the 50s. I’m trying to do the right things but the right way, so the goal doesn’t justify the means.\nCrunched: has the games industry stopped exploiting its workforce?\nThe presence of members of the vehicle team with over 20 years’ service at Reflections bears out that shift. Ben Merrick, a vehicle realisation expert who has been at Reflections 13 years, is happy to put vehicles into other studios’ games: “I love it, because vehicles have been my passion ever since I was a kid, so the ability to put vehicles and computer games together is great.\nJacquey points out that the days of even the most fiercely independent developers working on big games on their own are well and truly over: “In 2016, you’ll never do a game in isolation, regardless of whether or not you’re the lead developer – it doesn’t happen.\nIt’s not entirely rosy, of course. Jacquey admits that communication can pose problems: “It’s difficult. Obviously, everything is much simpler when everybody is located in the same area. But it’s simpler this way as well, because you’re not going through the difficulties of working with people who know more than you or different things than you.\nEvidence suggests that approach is paying off. Underground, which takes the Division’s action into the New York subway, might be the most hi-tech slab of DLC ever, as it uses procedural generation to ensure every mission you undertake in it is randomly generated and unique. Randomly generated dungeons have featured in old-school RPGs for years, but not in anything as complex as the Division.\nWith around 300 employees and plenty of ambition, it comes as a surprise to find that Jacquey complains of a problem that afflicts large swathes of the UK developer community: an inability to recruit staff.\n“We have 35 openings today, and we have a pretty ambitious growth strategy for the future. We’re not looking for juniors – we’re looking for seniors and experts, so that makes recruitment harder, of course,” she said.\nIt’s a problem that the games industry fears Brexit will amplify. Although Refections employs hundreds of Britons, the British higher education system has failed to provide games developers with enough graduates who possess the skills they need for years, so the industry has consistently looked to central and eastern Europe, as well as north America, for a significant proportion of its recruits.\nWhatever happens in the future, the French-owned company looks set to go from strength to strength.\nYou will be able to see for yourself in two of the most-anticipated games in development, this Christmas’s Watch Dogs 2 and next year’s Ghost Recon Wildlands, plus the imminent Underground pack for The Division and the whimsical, original Grow Up. All of which offers proof of the importance of cross-national collaboration.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Should I charge a client who does not come to a code help appointment?\n\nI agreed to help a new client refactor a piece of code. This is a simple task that should not take more than a couple of hours. He agreed to pay me my hourly rate.\nHe didn't come to the meeting, sending a message after 30 minutes apologizing for not being able to come due to unforeseen circumstances.\nUsually, in these cases I don't make the client pay for the time, and if the client is a recurring offender, I drop him. However, I came to reevaluate my actions.\nShould I grant a client a max number of \"free\" small absences, or should I take an assertive approach and charge him with a fee right away?\n\nA:\n\nI think your usual approach is the correct one. The vagaries of busy clients are an unfortunate obstacle to our making the best of of our freelance time. If you don't already, I would say it's good practice to send a courtesy email confirming the meeting on the day, just to ensure that it's still on the client's radar. It could be the most important meeting of your day but may well be a long way down the client's list of priorities.\nFrom a client's perspective, if a freelancer attempted to charge them for not attending a pre-arranged meeting, particularly if there is no contract in place that allows for time to be charged in this manner, I imagine that they would walk away. You'd find it very difficult to enforce the payment and would irreparably damage the relationship. If this is a first offence then you would be well advised to just take the hit and move on. If they are a repeat offender then they probably aren't worth pursuing. If they repeatedly fail to turn up to meetings then they are likely to be equally difficult to extract requirements/payment from.\n\nA:\n\nThis is a double edged sword:\nYour business needs cash flow, so charge him, but your business also needs client relationships so forgive him.\nPersonally, I would strike the balance between the two. If you incurred costs (milage etc), then recover the costs through fees, but no, don't charge him for your time.", "output": "I think you will have hard time trying to charge him for \"this\". Ask yourself, what are you charging him for? Did you have to travel to meeting point, take a night at the hotel, and he bailed on you? In such case, it's logical you charge him for your costs. \nBut if you just went to a nearby coffee bar or you waited for him in your office, then you cannot charge him for your costs. What are the costs?\nI think you somehow got offended by this client and being a freelancer means that you do not have privileges to do that. IMHO if the client so much offended you and you cannot afford letting him go, then I would charge him any minute I worked for him - meaning I would turn my \"anger\" into \"sorry no free work for you\". \nBut either of these ways will drive you to losing a client. So I guess, the smartest way is to swallow it and move on like nothing happened.

(Photo: Photo by Ellie White) \n  \n INDIANAPOLIS — Sarah Cummins was supposed to get married this weekend. The 25-year-old Purdue University pharmacy student had been planning her dream wedding for two years, scrimping and working overtime to save for the $30,000 extravaganza. \n  \n A week ago, she called it off (she prefers not to say why) and was left with a broken heart and a nonrefundable contract for a venue and a plated dinner for 170 guests Saturday night at the Ritz Charles in Carmel. \n  \n \"It was really devastating to me. I called everyone, canceled, apologized, cried, called vendors, cried some more, and then I started feeling really sick about just throwing away all the food I ordered for the reception,\" she said. \n  \n Then she decided to bring some purpose to her pain. She worked with event planner Maddie LaDow at the Ritz Charles to re-arrange the reception area, then started contacting homeless shelters in Indianapolis and Noblesville and inviting residents to her party. \n  \n \"We’re doing all the same stuff, just arranging the tables differently, so there's no head table for the bridal party, no cake table or gift table,\" she said. \n  \n Read more: \n  \n She and her mother will arrive early Saturday to set up the centerpieces they designed themselves — gold Eiffel Tower vases with roses. \n  \n The dinner will take place in the hotel's garden pavilion because Cummins said she always wanted an outdoor wedding but didn't want to risk the weather. \n  \n On the menu are bourbon-glazed meatballs, goat cheese and roasted garlic bruschetta, chicken breast with artichokes and Chardonnay cream sauce and, yes, wedding cake. \n  \n “It was really devastating to me.

She's hoping for about 150 people, but there's no firm count yet. \n  \n Obviously, this isn't the first time weddings have been canceled on short notice, LaDow said. \"Some people throw parties, some completely walk away, but none has ever done anything this charitable,\" she said of Cummins. \"It is very honorable of her.\" \n  \n The onetime bride-to-be said she doesn't feel particularly generous. \n  \n \"I will at least have some kind of happy memory to pull from,\" she said. \"I've worked so many weekends and so much overtime to pay for this, I wanted to make sure it would be the perfect wedding.\" \n  \n And she's still excited to see what it looks like, after two years of planning. \n  \n Plus, it's been a nice distraction instead of sitting around crying, she said. \n  \n She discussed her plans for what was to be their wedding with her ex-fiance, and she said he agreed that it's better for someone to enjoy the dinner and music they had planned. \n  \n If she can keep her emotions in check, she plans to stay for the dinner with her mom and at least two bridesmaids. \n  \n When it's over, Cummins said she's leaving on her honeymoon Sunday to the Dominican Republic — alone — before returning for classes at Purdue. \n  \n \"I'm going by myself.

It was a sunny, beautiful day for a wedding. \n  \n What's she doing now?: Bride who invited homeless to her reception now volunteers at shelter \n  \n About a dozen homeless veterans from the Hoosier Veterans Assistance Foundation stepped off the bus. Sarah Cummins, in a jeweled sleeveless peplum top and pastel pants, cheerfully greeted and welcomed them to the reception in the glass house, one of the many Pinterest-picture-perfect spots at the Ritz. \n  \n \"Thank you for having us,\" one of the veterans said, standing near a stunning tiered fountain. \"It means more than you know.\" \n  \n This was supposed to be Cummins' wedding day. \n  \n But after the 25-year-old Purdue University pharmacy student and her fiance, Logan Araujo, cancelled their $30,000 wedding a week ago for undisclosed reasons, the two were left with the non-refundable would-be celebration. \n  \n So Cummins decided to invite people from four area homeless shelters to enjoy the 170-person reception she and Araujo spent two years planning. \n  \n \"For me, it was an opportunity to let these people know they deserved to be at a place like this just as much as everyone else does,\" Cummins said. \n  \n More by Maureen Gilmer: Riley Champion returns to work for the hospital that saved her life \n  \n More by Amy Bartner: You've been pronouncing these Indiana words all wrong \n  \n Help local journalism: The 6 benefits of an IndyStar digital subscription \n  \n Inside, the guests from the veterans foundation, Wheeler Mission, Third Phase Christian Center and Dayspring Center, many dressed in semi-formal apparel, dined on hors d'oeuvres of bourbon-glazed meatballs, goat cheese and roasted garlic bruschetta. \n  \n \"It's beautiful,\" guest Erik Jensen said. \"We're having a great time.\" \n  \n Jensen, who has been at Wheeler Mission for five months, said he was humbled that he was the recipient of the former couple's kindness. \n  \n \"It's just a really great opportunity for us, that was going to be a huge tragedy in her life,\" he said. \"It's a great opportunity to spread love. Being homeless is kind of a big loss for all of these guys. This is just a very nice thing to do.\" \n  \n The men who attended from the Wheeler were selected based on their success in the mission's Steps Toward Economic and Personal Stability (STEPS) program. \n  \n \"We want to show them that if you excel, good stuff happens,\" Wheeler case manager Bryan Schrank. \n  \n The reception went on as the staff at the Ritz Charles planned it, event manager Sherry Harper said. Outside of rearranging the tables to remove the head table and compressing the time, dinner service happened as it usually would, right down to serving the wedding cake and the former couple's late-night snack of pizza. The cake, though, was pre-sliced behind the scenes. \n  \n \"We really didn't change anything,\" Harper said. \n  \n The story has inspired a wave of good will around the city and beyond. Matt Guanzon was among those reaching out locally. \n  \n The Indianapolis man donated some suits from his own closet so guests could dress up for the dinner, and others pitched in after he posted a request on his Facebook page. His tailor, A.Mina Fine Clothier & Tailors on Monument Circle, donated several pieces, and The Gifted Gown contributed dresses and accessories. \n  \n Guanzon, a contract negotiator for United Healthcare, rushed around Saturday in a cargo vehicle loaned by a friend, picking up the formal wear and dropping it off at the shelters throughout Central Indiana. \n  \n He even thought of the kids, asking that friends drop off children’s items at the Ritz before the dinner. \n  \n \"We mark our lives with the good times and sometimes the bad, so if we can help out in the good times, that’s what we're doing here today,\" Guanzon said. I’m just trying to show that even a little bit can help.\" \n  \n Charlie Allen, who's spent three months with at Wheeler Mission, received one of Guanzon's donated jackets. \n  \n \"I didn't have a sport coat,\" he said, tugging gently at the lapels of his new coat, smiling. \"I think I look pretty nice in it.\" \n  \n Allen, like others, was grateful for his invitation. \n  \n \"For a lot of us, this is a good time to show us what we can have,\" he said. \"Or to remind us what we had.\" \n  \n It was a difficult decision to attend, Cummins said, but when one of the homeless program directors said he was looking forward to meeting her, she knew she had to. \n  \n Three of her original seven bridesmaids, along with her mom and aunts, also came to support her during what they knew would be a hard day for her. \n  \n “Out of everything, I just want people to understand that there are still wonderful people in this world,” said college friend and bridesmaid Kendell Suevers. \n  \n IndyStar first reported this story Thursday, and it was quickly picked up by national and international media. The massive response, both negative and positive, was overwhelming, Cummins said. She says she doesn’t want any of the attention, but was caught off guard by how many people reached out to her. \n  \n \"There have been hundreds of people that have said how touched they were and how this is something that really meant a lot to them,\" she said. \n  \n When Cummins approached Araujo with the idea of donating the dinner, he agreed to what he thought was a selfless way to deal with something that would go to waste. \n  \n Cummin said Araujo footed most of the bill for the wedding and ceremony, both of which were to be at the Ritz Charles. Cummins and her parents, and one of Araujo's family friends, paid for the rest. They got $500 back from the photographer, but everything else — the DJ, a harpist, suits, bridesmaid dresses, centerpieces and a wedding dress — is sunk. \n  \n \"Everyone has done so much to give me the most wonderful experience and it just really sucks that they had to waste it,\" Cummins said. “It was a huge loss. But you gotta do what you gotta do, I guess. And that was one of the reasons I wanted to do something with the reception, because it literally felt like I was throwing that money in the trash. At least we can use it somehow.\" \n  \n She's not sure, yet, what she's going to do with the wedding dress. \n  \n \"It's too painful to think about,\" she said. \"I just love it so much. For me, I know my dream wedding is already gone. It’s happened. I got the dress, I got the place, I got everything I wanted.\" \n  \n And for one day, her guests felt a little bit of that. \n  \n \"It's a fantastic way to take something that's an unfortunate event, and to bless others,\" Schrank said. \"This is like Thanksgiving 2.0 for these guys.

On July 3, 2018, a cluster of fires in Russia’s Sakha province produced a smoke plume that traveled more than 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) in a span of 11 days.\nThe animation above shows aerosols traveling from Russia, across Alaska, and into central Canada from July 5 to July 9, 2018. The data were collected by the Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite (OMPS) on the Suomi-NPP satellite. As of July 14, the smoke plume– now much weaker– was located south of Greenland. The fires were mainly caused by thunderstorms and human activity.\nThe image below shows the smoke clouding the atmosphere as the plume moved over Alaska on July 7, 2018. The view was captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite.\nOne factor that influences the density of the plume is the number and intensity of its source fires, says Hiren Jethva, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Fires this year have been more intense in some regions of Russia than previous years. According to Jethva's review of satellite fire data, Central Russia saw around 7,200 fires over July 1-15, which is about four times higher than the average number of fires detected over the past five years (2013-2017).\nSmoke plumes can affect air quality at very long distances from their sources, as the polluting gases and aerosols emitted from fires are carried away by upper-level winds and air masses. For instance, this smoke plume passed over the Hudson Bay and shaded the land, as seen from this satellite perspective.\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using data from Suomi NPP OMPS and MODIS data from LANCE/EOSDIS Rapid Response.

{"input": "Are there any aircraft with a nose wheel braking system?\n\nI'm pretty sure that there are no aircraft equipped with a brake on its nose wheel, however two of my colleagues think there might have been.  Are there?\nAircraft with retractable gear of course have devices to stop the wheels from spinning when retracted,  but I'm asking about brakes used to stop or slow down the aircraft. Please don't consider aircraft with a tail wheel, gliders, experimental aircraft, or aircraft used for flight testing (certified aircraft only).\n\nA:\n\nThere are quite a few 727 that actually had nose wheel braking, however they utilized it only for maximum braking power. (Also they were proven to be ineffective and unreliable, so a service bulletin was written to remove the system).\nSaab Gripens use nose wheel brakes to stop as well, the main gear sits farther aft than most planes, so there is quite a bit of weight on the nose gear, which makes it effective for stopping.\n\nA:\n\nThe Messerschmitt Me-262 had nose wheel braking as well. Back then, with the high landing speed of jets and no thrust reversers, the engineers wanted to give pilots as much stopping power as possible.\nHere is a picture which shows the brake line running down to the wheel:\n\nAbandoned Me-262 after the war (picture source)", "output": "Good question. With regards to mainstream commercial jets it might not do much and quite possibly be counter-productive.\nMost (all?) Boeing and Airbus have about 95% of weight on the main landing gear (MLG), and thus the nose brake wouldn't be very heavily weighted, so not very effective. And for reasons of rotation, you don't want to load the nose very much, but rather have it pivot around the wings: where your lift is coming from.\nYou can then design the nose landing gear (NLG) to be quite light because it doesn't see a lot of load, nor take large braking reaction forces. And doesn't have any brakes/hydraulics etc. And the same with the fuselage strength: it's okay if the MLG take all the load: they are already in the \"beefy\" section of the plane, and there is no moment arm (torque) due to a big displacement from the centre-of-gravity (CG).\nHowever if you started to have large forces on the NLG, you have it a long way from the CG, and thus a big moment: you'd need to take that into account when you designed the fuselage, making it stronger, and thus heavier. At the moment with no lift on the front fuselage section, nor any forces from braking, you can make it pretty light.\nHaving the MLG at the CG and also centre-of-lift from the wings (drag from spoilers) makes for a very stable system. Inherently stable too: the faster you go, the more drag from the wings, and thus more weight on the MLG, which they need.\nI think this will be the case for all planes with propulsion from the wings: regardless if props or jets. If you have a prop on the nose it's a bit different because you need to beef that up anyways, so you don't mind the braking loads from a nose-wheel. But I don't see a lot of advantages for it. You add all the extra weight of the hydraulics and brakes, plus the weight from making a much stranger assembly. More complexity, more to service and go wrong.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

It updated again just yesterday, and while the change-log isn’t especially huge, some of the tweaks made are quite interesting.\nHave you ever wanted to run GTA 3, VC and SA simultaneously? If so… why? What possible need could you have for such a thing? You’re clearly very strange, but at least SilentPatch has you covered now, as it’s resolved an old long-standing bug that prevented the games from being run in parallel.\nMore practically, it seems that a lot of timing issues have been fixed across the shared engine. Across all three games, input latency for keyboard players is reduced by one frame. San Andreas’ dancing minigame will now also remain synced properly, wheras it would previously drift further off from accuracy the longer an individual play session went on.\nProbably the most baffling thing in the patch notes is in San Andreas ‘Setting a BMX on fire will not set CJ on fire anymore.’ Apparently the poor guy was psychically linked to his bike.

The schedule features live coverage of all 70 matches beginning Friday, August 11, at 2 p.m. ET on NBCSN with Premier League Live followed by Arsenal v. Leicester City at 2:45 p.m. ET.\nThe networks of NBCUniversal will present at least five games each week in the season’s first two months on NBC, NBCSN, and CNBC, with all games preceded and followed by Premier League Live pre- and post-match shows from the NBC Sports Group International Broadcast Center in Stamford, Conn.\nIn addition, matches will be telecast in Spanish each week by Telemundo and Universo, and will also be streamed on the Telemundo Deportes En Vivo app for mobile devices.\nPremier League games on NBC, NBCSN and CNBC will be streamed on NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app — NBC Sports Group’s live streaming product for desktops, mobile devices, tablets, and connected TVs. Coverage will be streamed via “TV Everywhere,” giving consumers additional value for their subscription service, and making high quality content available to MVPD customers both in and out of the home and on multiple platforms. The NBC Sports app is powered by Playmaker Media and available on the iTunes App Store, Google Play, Windows Store, Roku Channel Store, Apple TV and Amazon Fire.\nAll remaining Premier League matches will be made available on NBC Sports Gold — NBC Sports Digital’s direct-to-consumer live streaming product — “Premier League Pass,” giving fans in the U.S. exclusive access to 130 live Premier League matches plus the most robust offering of Premier League shoulder programming ever available in the U.S. The direct-to-consumer pass, powered by Playmaker Media, will stream coverage live and on-demand via desktop, mobile, tablets, and connected TV devices.

After signing a two-year contract extension in May, Arsene Wenger will look to bounce back from a tumultuous season that saw Arsenal finish outside the top-four for the first time in 21 years. Club-record signing Alexandre Lacazette – one of France’s most prolific strikers over the last four years – is expected to make his Arsenal debut. One year after their stunning title-winning season, Leicester finished 12th – the lowest by a defending champion in Premier League history, and with 44 points, the fewest by a reigning top-flight champion in 115 years. Striker Jamie Vardy will look to lead the way to a bounce-back season for the Foxes.\nIn an early meeting of last season’s top two clubs, reigning champions Chelsea take on a Tottenham side at Wembley – Spurs’ temporary home until their new stadium opens next season. Tottenham shut down White Hart Lane – their home for 118 years – by going unbeaten at the ground all season, including beating Chelsea 2-0 in January. Chelsea’s record-setting campaign overshadowed an extremely successful season for an up-and-coming Tottenham club, whose squad remains largely intact from last season – including two-time defending Golden Boot winner Harry Kane and 21-year-old Dele Alli.\nAfter remaining unbeaten in 11 of their final 12 league matches last season, Liverpool will look to carry momentum and push for their first title in 28 years. A healthy squad that includes Sadio Mane, plus $47 million summer signing Mohamed Salah, should bolster their chances at a second consecutive top-four finish. There should be no shortage of goals, as 17 have been scored in the last three league meetings between Arsenal and Liverpool. Last season, Jurgen Klopp became the first Liverpool manager to complete the league “double” over Arsenal since Gerard Houllier in 1999-00.\nAfter a disappointing debut season for Pep Guardiola that saw him fail to win a trophy for the first time in his managerial career, Manchester City made key summer signings in Portuguese midfielder Bernardo Silva and Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson. Man City opened last season with 10 straight wins in all competitions, and will hope to make a similar splash early on in this campaign as they host Liverpool after the season’s first FIFA international break. Manchester City have not won a Premier League meeting against Liverpool since August 2014.\nAfter hosting Leicester City on opening night, Arsenal have tough away matches at Stoke (Aug. 19) and at Liverpool (Aug. 27) before visiting defending champions Chelsea for a London Derby on September 17. The first meeting between these two clubs last season has been remembered by Antonio Conte’s second-half tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation, which ultimately turned Chelsea’s title fates despite the 3-0 loss.\nRomelu Lukaku’s transfer to Manchester United and Wayne Rooney’s transfer back to his boyhood club Everton this summer have made this match easily one of the marquee fixtures of the early season. Manchester United’s all-time leading scorer returns to Old Trafford for the first time since re-joining Everton, the club where he made his professional debut. Upon signing with Everton in July – 13 years after he left the Toffees for Man United as an 18-year-old – the now 31-year-old Rooney proclaimed: “I’m not coming back into a retirement home. I want to play and I want to win.” On the other side, Lukaku will be making his first appearance against his former club Everton. Last season Lukaku became just the fourth player in Premier League history to score more than 80 goals before turning 24. This season, he reunites with Jose Mourinho, who sold him to Everton in 2014 while they were both at Chelsea.\nIn addition, THE MEN IN BLAZERS SHOW hosted by Roger Bennett and Michael Davies makes its season premiere Monday, August 21, at 5:30 p.m. ET.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain the scope and depth of US intelligence surveillance in terms of data collection, targets, and usage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).", "output": "Over 151 million call records collected to track 42 targets under new \"limited\" access arrangement.\nEnlarge / While the intelligence community may have had some of its collection tentacles trimmed, the breadth of US surveillance continues to expand.\nA report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) yesterday provides a sobering set of statistics on the breadth and depth of US intelligence surveillance of targets both overseas and within the United States. Even after steps were taken to reduce the collection of phone call metadata—ending bulk collection of phone company records and limiting collection to specific requests against records held by telecommunications providers—the National Security Agency collected over 151 million phone call records while tracking only 42 targets.\nWhile this number is significantly smaller than the estimated billions of records that the NSA collected and retained each year under previous policy, it demonstrates just how broad the reach of surveillance of a limited number of individuals can go. Because the NSA collects data on numbers that are \"two hops\" away from a targeted phone, records would be collected from any number that called or was called by the target number, and then every number each of those numbers interacted with. As a result, collection expands exponentially as additional targets are added.\nOther statistics from the Statistical Transparency Report Regarding Use of National Security Authority for 2016—the third such report issued by the ODNI—reveal the ever-expanding nature of other surveillance by the NSA and other agencies under the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The number of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) \"probable cause\" orders issued per year has stayed relatively steady, with 1,559 orders issued by FISC applying to an estimated 1,687 targets—336 of whom are \"US persons.\" However, the total number of \"targets\" tracked through Internet surveillance and other means under FISA's Section 702 has steadily climbed well beyond that, reaching a total of 106,469 tracked individuals in 2016.\nThe number of queries against the data collected through Internet taps for information about Americans by the NSA and CIA also grew year over year in 2016. The report estimated that 5,288 \"known US person\" searches were conducted against content gathered with \"upstream\" collection—up from 4,672 in 2015. This does not include searches that were conducted against the records by the FBI, and it's based on the use of specific identifiers for Americans, such as e-mail addresses. It also doesn't count the number of times each specific query was used, so the 5,288 searches each may have been repeated multiple times.\nA more accurate count of the number of times the intelligence community searched for information on Americans comes from the report's \"estimated number of queries concerning a known US person of unminimized noncontents information\"—in other words, searches specifically looking for Americans by identifying metadata, such as name or phone number. In 2013, there were 9,500 of these; by 2016, that number had grown to 30,335. But apparently, the CIA has no way of counting how many of these queries are conducted, so the total excludes any of that agency's searches; these are all NSA queries.\nAnother development from 2016 was the very first instance of the FBI receiving and reviewing \"unminimized\" information (information that had not had personally identifying data removed to protect the privacy of Americans) to acquire evidence of a crime not related to FISA surveillance. In November of 2015, the FISC \"concluded that the FBI's US person querying provisions... are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\" In January, the Obama administration approved rules for applying that ruling further, allowing the NSA to share unminimized intercepted communications with a host of US agencies, so that number should grow dramatically in next year's report.\nOn April 28, the NSA announced that it was slightly curtailing the scope of its Section 702 collection, which depends largely on direct taps into the Internet backbone at major telecommunications nexus points (such as cable landing points and other major Internet peering locations). However, this change is unlikely to reduce the growth rate of overall data collection by the NSA, as it was focused exclusively on cutting back on the number of e-mails from Americans intercepted because of searches for \"selectors\" identifying tracked individuals within the content of some messages.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

This follows a year of two steep rounds of layoffs in the ballpark of 200 jobs in total.\nInsiders said slashing digital jobs in an environment where that sector is growing is indicative of broader turmoil. A rep from the company acknowledged impending job cuts, but said they were linked to the changing media landscape.\n“Our goal is to modernize and align our corporate functions to best support our brands and the company’s changing needs,” she said, without commenting on the number of cuts to come.\nThe rep declined to comment on recurring rumors that CEO Bob Sauerberg could be the next big layoff should he not be able to right the ship.\nAlthough cuts are on the horizon, there is still one big hire that is outstanding: the role of Glamour editor-in-chief. Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, who also serves as the company’s artistic director, is in the process of interviewing candidates for the top job after Cindi Leive tendered her resignation in September.\nWintour is said to be hard at work finding someone to turn around the business. Her search is nearing its home stretch, according to a knowledgeable source, who said that the new editor will likely be appointed in early 2018.\nFiled under condé nast , hearst , layoffs , magazines , meredith , on the money , time inc.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

He’s widely seen as a pioneer of personal computers.\nThe 68 year old revealed he believes simplicity is currently the only thing standing in the way of mass adoption.\n“A lot of the future, even for blockchain applications is very difficult to predict as the technology evolves and gets better and gets very secure and very fast and things like that, so we’re still just at the starting phases.\n“People were afraid to use their credit card when the internet first came out… Things like Bitcoin and cyber currencies are a little more difficult to use.\nThe tech entrepreneur did however warn, just like during the tech ‘bubble’, many blockchain and crypto developers will fail.\n“When the internet was gearing up and a lot of companies had ideas on how to change life with internet applications and the like… The early companies were all getting funded, funded, funded, they would change everything in our life and they all went bust.\n“Now everything in our life is now on the internet, everything you can do, the internet offers the best solutions.\nDoes Steve Wozniak own Bitcoin?\nDespite comparing it to the early days of Apple, Bitcoin isn’t something Steve Wozniak is investing in. He prefers to experiment.\nHe owns one solitary Bitcoin and is planning a major Bitcoin ‘adventure’.\n“My goal is to travel to another part of the world, like you know that I read articles about, and just take Bitcoin only,” he said at the conference.\n“When Bitcoin shot up sky high, oh, oh, oh, everyones commenting on price, I don’t want to be in that world because that’s worries, you’re always watching things.\nMicky explains the “Great Cryptocurrency Conspiracy”.

{"input": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.\n\"The current study provides details of sleep (or inactivity) in two wild, free-roaming African elephant matriarchs studied in their natural habitat with remote monitoring using an actiwatch subcutaneously implanted in the trunk, a standard elephant collar equipped with a GPS system and gyroscope, and a portable weather station. We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02:00 and 06:00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences to studies of elephant sleep in captivity are noted, and specific factors shaping sleep architecture in elephants, on various temporal scales, are discussed. \n  \n Thus, while there are indications of what sleep should be like, and how long it may last, for wild free-roaming elephants, the picture is not clear. Benedict and Lee [ 1 ] made an insightful observation regarding sleep in the elephant that could be translated to studies of sleep in wild elephants, stating: “The degree of trunk movement may well be taken as an index of whether the animal is asleep or awake.” ([ 1 ], p. 178]. On this basis we postulated that the use of actigraphy, a commonly used and extensively validated technique for studying sleep and sleep disorders in humans [ 20 ], would be particularly useful for quantifying inactivity/sleep in wild free-roaming elephants, creating a remote monitoring system associated with a GPS collar. To this end, we subcutaneously implanted an activity data logger (Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips Respironics) in the trunk of each of two wild, free-roaming African elephant matriarchs for a recording period of 35 days and attached a GPS collar. The results of this study reveal a far richer story of elephant rest and sleep than would be predicted from captive studies, and indicate numerous areas for fruitful future research to deepen our understanding of these iconic mammals and their sleep. \n  \n In addition to this, anatomical studies have highlighted two specializations within the neuronal arousal systems of African elephants indicating that they should be quite short sleepers [ 16 ]. It was noted that in the hypothalamus of the African elephant, a medially located parvocellular cluster of orexinergic neurons was present [ 16 ]. This parvocellular orexinergic neuronal cluster has only been observed in Cetartiodactyls previously [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. Second, a novel medial locus coeruleus nuclear subdivision within the periventricular gray matter of the pons was observed in the African elephant, a feature not observed in any other mammal studied to date [ 16 ]. Thus, these two novel nuclei, associated with arousal in other mammals, may contribute to lower sleep times in elephants. \n  \n Graphs plotting the relationship between body mass ( Mb , in grams, g ) and total sleep time ( TST , in hours, h ) for all mammals, minus elephant data ( A ) and for herbivores, minus elephant data ( B ). In both cases regressions indicating a lower TST with increased body mass is observed, but this regression, while significant for all mammals, only approaches significance for the herbivores (data used from [ 14 ]). Using the derived regression equations, the predicted TST for African elephants has been labelled on each regression line to contrast with observed results from both captive and wild studies (see Table 1 ). \n  \n Can we predict how much a wild free-roaming elephant will sleep? While contentious, there does appear to be a relationship between body mass and total sleep time across mammals, a relationship that is more apparent when only herbivores are analysed [ 14 ]. When the elephant data is removed from that used by Siegel [ 14 ], a statistically significant relationship between body mass (M b ) and total sleep time (TST), across all mammals for which data is available, becomes apparent, where TST = 17.946 x Mb − 0.076 (r 2 = 0.25, P uncorr = 0.0019) ( Fig 1A ), although only 25% of the variance in TST is explained by this relationship. Using this regression equation, African elephants (with adult body masses ranging from 2400–6300 kg) [ 15 ] can be predicted to sleep between 5.46–5.87 hours per day. Interestingly, this prediction is within the range reported for TST in captive elephants ( Table 1 , Fig 1A ), although it should be noted that the majority of the data used in this regression was obtained from observational studies of captive mammals. When herbivores alone (minus the elephant data) are analysed, the explanatory value of body mass on TST variance increases (higher r 2 value), but the regression only approaches significance, such that TST = 21.995 x Mb − 014 (r 2 = 0.67, P uncorr = 0.0611) ( Fig 1B ). Using this regression as a predictor, African elephants should sleep between 2.45 to 2.81 hours per day. This prediction is substantially less than that observed in previous studies of elephant sleep in either captivity or the wild ( Table 1 , Fig 1B ). \n  \n One concern with these studies is that many have been undertaken in the captive setting, with food and water provided and no predation risk, thus not likely reflecting sleep in wild free-roaming elephants. It has been shown [ 13 ] that an animal can sleep significantly less in its natural environment than in an artificial environment. That wild elephants appear to sleep less than their captive conspecifics has already been demonstrated [ 5 , 8 ]; however, the observational studies of resting/sleep in wild elephants also suffer from problems such as elephants not being observed at night [ 4 ], or conflating rest and sleep [ 5 , 6 ], such that elephants are thought to rest/sleep for up to 2.4 hours during the daylight period [ 6 ]. Thus, no unbiased, or remote monitoring, measure of rest/sleep in the wild free-roaming African elephant is currently available. \n  \n African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are iconic mammals of the continent, and being the largest land mammals have always been of interest in terms of scientific research as an extreme data point for basic physiological functions, such as sleep. Due to their large size, sleep in elephants has been of interest since Benedict and Lee [ 1 ] provided the first observations of sleep in circus elephants. This study and several subsequent observational studies (summarized in Table 1 ), both in captive and wild African and Asian elephants, have developed a generalized picture of sleep in elephants [ 2 – 12 ]. Elephants have been observed to be resting/sleeping while standing [ 8 ] with the end of their trunk resting on the ground and usually with their eyes closed, and it has also been observed that elephants can sleep in a recumbent position, during which time REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is presumed to occur, although definitive evidence of rapid eye movements during sleep is still lacking for elephants [ 8 ]. The estimates of the daily time spent sleeping by elephants range between 3.10–6.90 hours per day, although the times recorded in the wild setting had lower average total sleep times (3.17–3.36 h/day) [ 5 ]. The major sleep episodes for elephants were seen to occur between 22.00 and 07.00, with the time of awakening occurring between 04.30 and 07.00 ( Table 1 ). Thus, elephants appear to be polyphasic, mostly nocturnal sleepers, that appear to wake at around sunrise after approximately 3–6 hours of sleep each night, and that can sleep standing or in recumbency. \n  \n Similarly, no correlation between the actual amount of trunk activity (sum of all counts recorded by the actiwatch) between main sleep episodes and the total sleep time or the duration of the subsequent major sleep episode was observed ( Fig 9 ). For Matriarch 1, the average sum of counts of trunk activity between major sleep episodes amounted to 302 494 (s.d. = 109 721; range = 208 847–653 189) ( Fig 9A ), while for Matriarch 2 the average sum of counts of trunk activity between major sleep episodes amounted to 376 255 (s.d. = 91 771; range = 306 012–718 812) ( Fig 9B ). In both elephants a weak trend towards having a longer total sleep time or main sleep episode with a smaller sum of trunk activity between main sleep episodes was apparent, but these trends were not statistically significant for either individual elephant or when the data from both elephants was combined. This lack of correlation was maintained when the days without sleep, leading to a greater distance and time between major sleep episodes, were excluded from the analysis. \n  \n Scatterplots showing the lack of a relationship between distance travelled between the sites of the main sleep episodes (kilometres, km ) and total sleep time ( TST , hours, h ) ( A ) or duration of the main sleep episode (hours, h ) ( B ) for both Matriarch 1 ( closed circles ) and Matriarch 2 ( open squares ). While there is a trend for shorter sleep times with increased distance travelled, these trends are not statistically significant even when the days without sleep are removed from the analysis. These plots demonstrate that prior activity does not appear to affect sleep times. \n  \n In order to assess whether the level of activity prior to sleep influenced the duration of sleep, we examined the distance travelled between main sleep episodes and the counts of trunks movements between main sleep episodes, with the subsequent length of the main sleep episode and the associated total daily sleep time. No correlation between the distance traversed between main sleep episodes and the total sleep time or the duration of the subsequent major sleep episode was observed ( Fig 8 ). For Matriarch 1, the average distance traversed between major sleep episodes amounted to 16.1 km (s.d. = 13.2 km; range = 5.1–66.4 km) ( Fig 9A ), while for Matriarch 2 the average distance traversed was 17.3 km (s.d. = 9.9 km; range = 7.7–51.5 km) ( Fig 8B ). In both elephants a weak trend towards having a longer total sleep time or main sleep episode with a shorter distance traversed between main sleep episodes was apparent, but these trends were not statistically significant for either individual elephant or when the data from both elephants was combined. This lack of correlation was maintained when the days without sleep, leading to a greater distance and time between major sleep episodes, were excluded from the analysis. \n  \n As each animal had a GPS collar attached, we could, post-hoc, determine the vegetation type selected by each elephant as a sleeping location by matching these sites to vegetation maps of the Chobe National Park. Both elephants showed no specific preference for the vegetation types associated with the selection of sleep sites for the main sleep episode, or the shorter sleep episodes. Matriarch 1 spent the first three days of the recording period having the main sleep episode in open to dense savanna Mopane woodland (partially lacustrine), with the remaining days of the recording period selecting sites for the main sleep episode in Baikiaea plurijuga (African teak) woodlands (deep sand), that on occasion was associated with dense woodland areas, or more open savanna areas, and sometimes associated with Guibourtia coleosperma (African rosewood or large false mopane) woodland and/or Burkea africana (wild syringa) dense to open savanna (reworked sands). Matriarch 2 showed a very similar pattern of vegetative selection for the sleeping site of the main sleep episode, but spent the first night of the recording period in Baikiaea plurijuga (African teak) woodlands, the next two nights in open to dense savanna Mopane woodland, before following a similar variety of vegetation types as Matriarch 1 for the remainder of the recording period. These observations indicate that specific vegetation types were not preferentially selected as sleeping sites by the elephants. \n  \n Bar graph showing the distance (kilometres, km ) between sites of the major sleep episode of Matriarch 1 and Matriarch 2 on each day of the recording period when sleep occurred. The average distance between the sites of the major sleep episode for the two elephants on the same day was 9.3 km (s.d. = 8.1 km, range = 0.15–34.05 km). The closest the two matriarchs (and their respective herds) came to sleeping in the same location was 150 m, but on other days they could be over 34 km apart. \n  \n The two elephants monitored slept in new locations on every day of the recording period ( Table 3 ). The straight-line distance between the locations of the main sleep episodes for Matriarch 1 averaged 7.2 km (s.d. = 8.2 km; range = 0.8–40.2 km) and for Matriarch 2 averaged 6.9 km (s.d = 7.4 km; range = 0.5–29.1 km) ( Fig 6 ). The actual distance travelled between each sleep location between main sleep episodes averaged 16.1 km (s.d. = 13.2 km; range = 5.1–66.4 km) for Matriarch 1 and 17.3 km (s.d. = 9.9 km; range = 7.7–51.5 km range) for Matriarch 2 ( Fig 6 ). While inhabiting the same general area of the Chobe National Park, the two elephants did not sleep in the same location on any of the days recorded, meaning that the herds led by these two matriarchs did not appear to merge during the recording period, at least for sleeping. The average distance between the sites of the major sleep episode for the two animals on the same day was 8.9 km (s.d. = 7.9 km, range = 0.15–34.05 km) ( Fig 7 ). Thus, the closest the two matriarchs (and their respective herds) came to sleeping in the same location was 150 m, but on other days they could be over 34 km apart. \n  \n In the four days following these extended periods without sleep, total sleep times for Matriarch 1 were 2.4, 3.6, 2.9, and 2.3 h (2.8 h average) for the dates 18–21 April, total sleep times for Matriarch 2 were 2.0, 1.0, 2.8, and 2.1 h (1.98 h average) for the dates 18–21 April, total sleep times for Matriarch 2 were 3.6, 1.4, 1.3, and 1.3 h (1.9 h average) for the dates 6–9 May, total sleep times for Matriarch 1 were 2.7, 1.2, 2.2 and 0.8 h (1.73 h average) for the dates 09–12 May, and total sleep times for Matriarch 1 were 1.3, 1.8, 0.4 and 0.6 h (1.03 h average) for the dates 15–18 May. Thus, in only one instance (Matriarch 1: 18–21 April) does there appear to be sleep rebound, in the form of increased TST duration, following the approximately 46 hours without sleep. It should also be noted here that recumbent sleep only occurred on one of the five days following the days without sleep (Matriarch 2 on the 6 th of May, a 25 minute period of recumbent sleep on the left side). Thus, after the days without sleep there was, in general, no sign of additional recumbent sleep that might be interpreted as sleep rebound. \n  \n Line plots of trunk activity (calculated as percent of maximum activity to allow direct comparison between animals, thinner line ) and speed of whole body movement (calculated as distance between subsequent GPS locations divided by time in kilometres per hour, km/h , thicker line ) over the day prior to the day with no sleep, the day of no sleep and the day following no sleep, for the five occasions when this occurred during the recording period. The three grey regions in each plot represent the three periods between sunset and sunrise incorporated into these plots. The plots provided are of 15 minute moving averages, which highlight the periods (and reduce the noise of the raw data) of increased and sustained bodily and trunk activity when the elephants would have been predicted to be sleeping (see Figs 2 and 3 ). ( A ) Matriarch 1 16–18 April, ( B ) Matriarch 2 16–18 April, ( C ) Matriarch 2 04–06 May, ( D ) Matriarch 1 07–09 May, and ( E ) Matriarch 1 13–15 May. mse –main sleep episode, with the horizontal bar length representing the duration of the episode. \n  \n While the activity of the elephants appeared to be following a typical pattern, at approximately 20:00 on the evening of the 17 th of April, both elephants appeared to become unusually active, especially in terms of speed of whole body movement as judged from GPS location, for extended periods ( Fig 5 ). At this time the elephants were located 3.09 km apart. For Matriarch 1, the period of increased whole body motor activity appeared to last for at least 11 hours after the initiation of this increased activity, and while the activity levels dropped to normal during the daylight of the 18 th of April, whole body movement was still high in the afternoon and into the night until around 23:30 ( Fig 5A ). During the approximately 11 hours of increased activity, Matriarch 1 traversed a total distance of 32.22 km (27.01 km straight line distance). For Matriarch 2, this period of increased motor activity was maintained for at least 10 hours, but there was a sustained higher than normal activity lasting through to 21:00 on the evening of the 18 th of April ( Fig 5B ). During the approximately 10 hours of increased activity, Matriarch 2 traversed a total distance of 24.57 km (21.79 km straight line distance). On the evening of the 5 th of May, at approximately 19:00, the whole body motor activity of Matriarch 2 was observed to increase, though not as dramatically as on the 17 th of April, and this was sustained until 11:30 the following morning ( Fig 5C ). During the approximately 16.5 hours of increased activity, Matriarch 2 traversed a total distance of 38.09 km (28.19 km straight line distance). In the late afternoon of the 8 th of May, at approximately 16:30, the whole body motor activity of Matriarch 1 was observed to increase dramatically, and this increased activity was sustained through to 05:00 the following morning, but was at higher than normal levels for most of the following day ( Fig 5D ). During the approximately 10.5 hours of sustained increased activity, Matriarch 1 traversed a total distance of 41.68 km (36.61 km straight line distance). On the evening of the 14 th of May, at approximately 19:00, the whole body motor activity of Matriarch 1 was observed to increase, though not as dramatically as on the 17 th of April, and this was sustained until 05:30 the following morning ( Fig 5E ). During the approximately 10.5 hours of increased activity, Matriarch 1 traversed a total distance of 15.00 km (5.62 km straight line distance). \n  \n One of the more unexpected findings of the current study was the observation that on 4 specific days during the recording period the elephants did not appear to sleep. On the 17 th of April neither elephant showed any inactivity of the trunk that could be scored as sleep. On the 5 th of May Matriarch 2 showed no signs of sleep, on the 8 th of May, Matriarch 1 had two 5 min episodes of trunk inactivity close to sunset, and on the 14 th of May Matriarch 1 exhibited one 5 min episode of trunk inactivity at around 3 am. The times between main sleep episodes were: 45 h 19 min on the 16–18 th of April for Matriarch 1; 48 h 41 min on the 16–18 th of April for Matriarch 2; 46 h 00 min on the 4–6 th of May for Matriarch 2; 45 h 40 min on the 7–9 th May for Matriarch 1 (if the two short episodes are ignored); and 46 h 05 min on the 13–15 th of May for Matriarch 1 (if the one short episode is ignored). No specific extreme weather conditions were noted on any of these four days, nor were any correlations observed to the lunar cycle (i.e. full moon) that coincided with these days without sleep. \n  \n Due to the lack of correlation between awakening and sunrise times we examined the relationship of minimum WBGT (see above) to the timing of awakening. Awakening for Matriarch 1 occurred prior to minimum WBGT for 23 out of 32 awakening events (71.9%), while for Matriarch 2 awakening occurred prior to minimum WBGT for 24 out of 33 awakening events (72.7%) (see below for days without sleep). Matriarch 1, on average, woke up 40.45 min (s.d. = 101.8 min; range = 275 min prior to 195 min after) prior to minimum WBGT, while Matriarch 2 woke up, on average, 53.94 min (s.d. = 102.6 min; range = 205 min prior to 255 min after) prior to minimum WBGT. Thus, the two elephants studied generally woke up prior to the time of minimum WBGT (Matriarch 1: p = 0.032; Matriarch 2: p = 0.005; paired T-test), and while this is a statistically significant result, the variance is high ( Fig 4E ). The WBGT at the time of awakening, either before or after minimum WBGT, was, on average, 0.82 degrees higher than the minimum WBGT for Matriarch 1 (s.d. = 0.74 degrees; range = 0 to 2.99 degrees), while for Matriarch 2 it was on average 0.96 degrees (s.d. = 0.76 degrees; range = 0.03 to 3.03 degrees) higher than the minimum WBGT. Statistically significant linear correlations existed between minimum WBGT (WBGT min ) and WGBT at awakening (WBGT wake ) for both elephants ( Fig 4D ), irrespective of arousal occurring prior to or after the time of minimum WBGT, such that for Matriarch 1: and for Matriarch 2: \n  \n The time of sunrise was 06:32 at the start of the 35-day recording period, and was 06:42 at the end of the recording period. Sleep offset, or the time of awakening, was defined as the end of the last consolidated sleep bout, greater than 10 minutes, that occurred prior to sunrise. The time of awakening varied during the recording period, but for Matriarch 1 the average time of awakening was 05:07 (s.d. = 68 min; range = 02:05 to 06:20), for Matriarch 2 the average time of awakening was 04:56 (s.d. = 44 min; range = 03:35 to 06:20), while combined the average time of awakening was 05:01 (s.d. = 57 min) ( Fig 4E ). Matriarch 1 woke up on average of 87.3 min (s.d. = 66.6 min; range = 12–270 min) prior to sunrise, Matriarch 2 woke up on average of 103.9 min (s.d. = 47.7 min; range = 19–197 min) prior to sunrise, while combined the average time of awakening prior to sunrise was 95.7 min (s.d. = 57.9 min). Thus, the two elephants studied always woke up prior to sunrise and not a single substantive episode for either of the two elephants sleeping for several hours after sunrise was observed ( Fig 2 ). In addition, the two elephants, on average, woke up 72.7 min prior to civil dawn (which occurred 23 min prior to sunrise), 46.7 min prior to nautical dawn (which occurred 49 min prior to sunrise) and 21.7 min prior to astronomical dawn (which occurred 74 min prior to sunrise) ( Fig 4E ). No clear correlations indicated that dawn, of any sort, played a significant role in awakening. \n  \n Due to the lack of a relationship between sleep onset and sunset times we examined the relationship of minimum wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to the timing of sleep onset. The timing of minimum WBGT varied throughout the recording period, but the minimum WBGT was recorded on average at 05:46 (s.d. = 82.8 min; range = 01:40 to 07:00). Minimum WBGT occurred on average 50.5 min (s.d. = 81.9 min; range = 196 min prior to 28 min after sunrise) prior to sunrise, and while minimum WBGT often occurred at a regular time after sunrise, there was a great deal of variability of timing of minimum WBGT, providing no consistent relationship with the timing of sunrise ( Fig 4B ). Sleep onset generally occurred substantially earlier than the minimum WBGT ( Fig 4E ). Sleep onset for Matriarch 1 occurred prior to minimum WBGT for 31 out of 32 sleep onset events (96.9%), while for Matriarch 2 sleep onset occurred prior to minimum WBGT for 32 out of 33 sleep onset events (97.0%) (see below for days without sleep). Sleep onset for Matriarch 1 was, on average, 268.13 min (4 h 28.13 min; s.d. = 135.0 min; range = 580 min prior to 45 min after) prior to minimum WBGT, while sleep onset for Matriarch 2 was, on average, 258.64 min (4 h 18.64 min; s.d. = 131.6 min; range = 580 min prior to 80 min after) prior to minimum WBGT ( Fig 4A and 4E ). Thus, sleep onset in the two elephants studied generally occurred prior to the time of minimum WBGT (Matriarch 1: p = 1.85 x 10 −12 ; Matriarch 2: p = 1.07 x 10− 12 ; paired T-test), and while this is a statistically significant result, the variance is high ( Fig 4E ). \n  \n Graphs showing the relationships between wet globe bulb temperatures ( WBGT ) and the timing of sleep onset and offset/awakening in the two elephants studied. A . This graph shows the hourly averages (with the bars representing 1 standard deviation) for WBGT during the 35-day recording period. The grey region represents the period between sunset and sunrise. B . This graph depicts the relationship between the timing of the minimum WBGT and the various dawn times (dark grey bars), including sunrise ( sr ), civil dawn ( cd ), nautical dawn ( nd ) and astronomical dawn ( ad ). C . Graph representing the statistically significant linear relationships between minimum WBGT ( WBGT min ) and WGBT at sleep onset ( WBGT onset ) for both elephants (Matriarch 1 – M1 ; Matriarch 2 – M2 ). D . Graph representing the statistically significant linear relationships between minimum WBGT ( WBGT min ) and WGBT at sleep offset/awakening ( WBGT wake ) for both elephants. E . Graph showing the relationships between the hourly changes in WBGT averaged over the 35 day recording period, the daily sleep onset and awakening times for both elephants, the timing of the daily minimum of WBGT, and the specific sunset (including sunset– ss , civil twilight– ct , nautical twilight– nt , and astronomical twilight– at ) and sunrise times. Note that sleep onset, time of sleep and sleep offset/awakening all occurred during the period when the WBGT was slowly dropping, and do not coincide with the rapid periods of cooling (around sunset) or warming (after sunrise). \n  \n The time of sunset was 18:11 at the start of the 35-day recording period, and was 17:53 at the end of the recording period. Sleep onset was defined as the beginning of the first consolidated period of sleep, greater than 10 minutes, following sunset. The timing of sleep onset varied during the recording period, but for Matriarch 1 the average time of sleep onset was 01:20 (s.d. = 127 min; range 19:00 to 04:05), for Matriarch 2 the average time of sleep onset was 01:45 (s.d. = 88 min; range 21:20 to 04:50), while combined the average time of sleep onset was 01:33 (s.d. = 109 min) ( Fig 4E ). Matriarch 1 went to sleep on average 7 h 18 min (s.d. = 127 min; range = 51 to 609 min) after sunset, Matriarch 2 went to sleep on average 7 h 43 min (s.d. = 89 min; range = 200–664 min) after sunset, while combined the average time of sleep onset after sunset was 7 h 31 min (s.d. = 109 min). Thus, the two elephants studied always went to sleep a substantial time after sunset, but the timing of sleep onset was quite variable ( Fig 4E ). The timing of sleep onset was also substantially after civil twilight (which occurred 22 min after sunset), nautical twilight (which occurred 47 min after sunset) and astronomical twilight (which occurred 73 min after sunset). No clear correlations indicate that sunset, of any sort, played a significant role in sleep onset. \n  \n In order to determine whether the wild free-roaming elephants ever slept in a recumbent position, as seen in studies of captive elephants (see Table 1 ), we analysed data from a gyroscope placed within the collar and correlated it with the episodes of trunk inactivity scored as sleep. For each elephant we found evidence of recumbent sleep on only 10 of the 35 days of recording, although these were on different days for each elephant, and the remaining 25 days for each elephant showed no recumbent sleep ( Fig 3A and 3B ). For Matriarch 1, the total amount of time spent in recumbent sleep over the 35-day recording period was 719 min (11 h 58.8 min), while Matriarch 2 spent 453 min (7 h 33 min) in recumbent sleep. As an overall average, Matriarch 1 spent 20.54 min (s.d. = 39.33 min; range = 0 to 142 min) per day in recumbent sleep, while Matriarch 2 spent 12.94 min (s.d. = 22.35 min; range = 0 to 73 min) in recumbent sleep; however, as mentioned each elephant only exhibited recumbent sleep on 10 of the 35 days of recording, with Matriarch 1 having 12 episodes of recumbent sleep and Matriarch 2 having 14 episodes. For Matriarch 1 only one recumbent sleep episode was recorded on 8 of the 10 days when recumbent sleep occurred (with 2 episodes per day on the remaining 2 days), while for Matriarch 2 only one recumbent sleep episode was recorded on 6 of the 10 days when recumbent sleep occurred (with 2 episodes per day on the remaining 4 days). The episodes of recumbent sleep had an average duration of 65.35 min (s.d. = 42.55 min; range 18 to 142 min) for Matriarch 1, while recumbent sleep episodes had an average duration of 37.75 min (s.d. = 17.60 min; range = 4 to 73 min) for Matriarch 2. As a proportion of TST, Matriarch 1 spent 15.17% of TST in a recumbent position, while Matriarch 2 spent 12.00% of TST in a recumbent position. Matriarch 1 was a “left-trunker”, while Matriarch 2 was a “right-trunker” (see methods section). Of the time spent in recumbent sleep, Matriarch 1 spent 48.4% lying in her left side, and 51.6% lying on her right side, while Matriarch 2 spent 71.3% lying on her left side and 28.7% lying on her right side, indicating no relationship between trunk side preference and recumbent sleep side preference. \n  \n The timing of sleep in the elephant was clearly nocturnal ( Fig 2 ), with 94.6% of all 5 min epochs of sleep occurring between sunset and sunrise ( Fig 3C ). The vast majority of this nocturnal sleep occurred between 01:00 and 06:00, although sleep episodes could be observed earlier in the night. While there appears to be some episodes during daylight that could be classified as “napping”, these were limited and did not occur on a daily basis, and appeared to occur mostly between 10:30 and 15:30 ( Fig 3 ). \n  \n A and B . Bar graphs representing total sleep time on each day through the 35-day recording period for each elephant, A –Matriarch 1, B –Matriarch 2. Note that on certain days no sleep was observed. The bars also represent the amount of time spent in standing sleep ( black ) and in recumbent sleep ( grey ), although recumbent sleep did not occur on each day. C . Graph illustrating the average count of inactivity/sleep episodes for any given 5 min period scored over the 35 day recording period and combining the data from both elephants. Note the clearly nocturnal pattern of inactivity, with little inactivity occurring during the daytime.

Each solid mark indicates a period of 5 minutes or more when the trunk of each elephant was completely immobile, the elephant presumably being asleep. The grey regions represent the period between sunset and sunrise. Note that the vast majority of sleep occurred during the hours leading up to sunrise, but occasional sleep episodes could occur at different times throughout the 24-h period. \n  \n Sleep in the two elephants did not occur in a single episode, rather, each day where sleep occurred (see below for exceptions) it consisted of multiple episodes, making the elephant a polyphasic sleeper (Figs 2 , 3A and 3B ). Matriarch 1 had an average of 4 sleep episodes per day (s.d. = 3; range = 0–11), Matriarch 2 had an average of 5 sleep episodes per day (s.d. = 2; range = 0–11), and combined the average number of daily sleep episodes were 5 (s.d. = 3). In each day there was one main episode of sleep (the longest episode of daily sleep), with a number of shorter episodes of sleep occurring mostly prior to the main sleep episode, but also on occasion occurring after the main sleep episode ( Fig 2 ). The main sleep episode (excluding the days in which the elephants showed no signs of sleep, see below) in Matriarch 1 averaged 1.3 h (s.d. = 0.7 h; range = 0.1–1.9 h), in Matriarch 2 the average duration of the main sleep episode was 0.8 h (s.d. = 0.5 h; range = 0.17–1.8 h), while combined the main sleep episode averaged 1.1 h (s.d. = 0.7 h). For the remaining non-main episodes of sleep, in Matriarch 1 the average duration of these episodes was 22.3 min (s.d. = 18.8 min; range = 5.0–85.0 min), for Matriarch 2 the average duration was 14.8 min (s.d. = 8.6 min; range = 5.0–40.0 min), while combined the average duration of these non-main sleep episodes was 18.6 min (s.d. = 15.0 min). \n  \n Total daily sleep time (TST) in Matriarch 1 averaged 2.3 h (s.d. = 1.3 h, range = 0–5 h), while for Matriarch 2 the TST averaged 1.8 h (s.d. = 1.0 h, range = 0–3.6 h). If the data for both elephants is combined, the average TST is 2.0 h (s.d. = 1.2 h). Despite this, during the recording period there were four days in which the elephants recorded from did not sleep, or were inactive for less than 10 minutes (see below for full details), and this slightly increases these average times and slightly reduces the standard deviation. Thus, when these days of minimal to no sleep are eliminated from the analysis, TST in Matriarch 1 averaged 2.5 h (s.d. = 1.2 h, range = 0.4–5 h), for Matriarch 2 TST averaged 1.9 h (s.d. = 0.9 h, range = 0.3–3.6 h), while for both elephants combined, the average TST was 2.2 h (s.d. = 1.1 h). \n  \n RD –recording day; D –date as day and month; SST –time of sunset; SRT –time of sunrise; MRT– time of moonrise; MST –time of moonset; MI% –percentage of moon face illuminated; SONT –time of sleep onset; SOFT –time of sleep offset; TST (h) –total sleep time in hours; MSEd (h) –main sleep episode duration in hours; RSd (min) –recumbent sleep time in minutes; WBGTmin (°) –minimum wet bulb globe temperature in degrees; WBGTminT –time of minimum wet bulb globe temperature; WBGT SON (°) –wet bulb globe temperature at sleep onset; WBGT SOF (°) –wet bulb globe temperature at sleep offset; SLD MSEs (km) –straight line distance between main sleep episode sites in kilometres; D MSEs (km) –total distance traversed between main sleep episodes sites in kilometres; D M1/M2 MSEs (km) –distance between main sleep episode sites of matriarch 1 and matriarch 2 in kilometres; TAC MSE –sum of trunk activity counts between main sleep episodes; M1 –matriarch 1; M2 –matriarch 2; X –days without data as the elephants did not sleep on these days. \n  \n In the current analysis we have considered that inactivity of the trunk for a period of 5 minutes or greater is considered to be a strong sign that the elephant is sleeping. In this sense, we refer to prolonged periods of trunk inactivity as sleep in the current description, with the caveat that trunk inactivity is merely a proxy measurement of sleep in the elephant. Conversely, periods of active trunk movement exclude the possibility of behaviourally defined sleep. Isolated bouts of 5 minutes of trunk inactivity may or may not be accompanied by the full physiological manifestations of sleep, but given the near impossibility of recording even the minimum polysomnographic parameters required to accurately determine physiological sleep in the elephant (in either the captive or wild setting), we feel that this proxy measurement provides an accurate estimate of the maximum amount of sleep of the elephant, although generally actigraphy may overestimate sleep times due to the difficulty in distinguishing quiet wake from sleep using actigraphy alone. Thus, for the remainder of this description we refer to periods of 5 minutes or greater of trunk inactivity as sleep episodes, with these caveats in mind. The raw data analysed and presented in the following sections is provided in Table 2 . \n  \n Discussion \n  \n The present study of two wild matriarch African elephants has revealed a number of important observations regarding sleep in their natural habitat, that are both similar to, and that differ significantly from, previous observational studies made on captive elephants (Table 1). Briefly, the elephants studied were primarily nocturnal, polyphasic sleepers that have an average of 2 hours of sleep per night. We observed that the elephants sleep in either a standing or recumbent posture, although neither sleep type occurred on all nights of the recording period, with recumbent sleep occurring roughly every third or fourth night, and for 5 out of 70 nights of recording no sleep was observed. Sleep onset and offset showed distinct relationships to the environmental conditions, the elephants did not use the same sleep site during the recording period, and total sleep time was not related to the amount of activity between sleep periods. The current observations provide a far richer story of elephant sleep in their natural environment than would have been suspected from studies in zoo or circus animals and underscores the need to study sleep more broadly in the natural habitat in addition to controlled settings. \n  \n Limitations of the current study While we feel the current study has produced a number of exciting and interesting results regarding sleep in wild elephants, there are three specific aspects of the study that need to be highlighted in order to properly contextualize the data presented here. First, the study was undertaken on only two adult female elephants that were both matriarchs of their respective herds. In this sense, the sleep patterns and times outlined herein might not be representative of wild elephants as a whole, as no males were included in the study, no non-matriarch females were included, and the responsibilities of the matriarch of a herd may affect sleep patterns. Second, Matriarch 2 was nursing a calf of less than 1 year old which appears to have led to a shorter overall average amount of sleep, an increased fracturing of sleep (Fig 2) and less recumbent sleep (Fig 3) in this animal compared to the non-nursing Matriarch 1. However, it should be noted that elephant calves nurse until they reach approximately 3–5 years of age, or until another sibling is born which can occur 3–4 years after the first calf, thus it would be more rare for a matriarch elephant to be without a suckling calf than to have a suckling calf [15]. Despite the differences between the nursing and non-nursing elephants, the remaining parameters measured appeared to be very similar between the two animals, indicating that we can, at the very least, make generalizations about sleep of wild, free-roaming matriarch elephants from the current study. The third aspect of the current study that needs to be highlighted is that we did not use polysomnography (PSG) to record true physiological sleep; rather, we used actigraphy of the trunk as a proxy to infer sleep. As mentioned earlier, we are aware that actigraphy can overestimate sleep times, due to the difficulty in determining quiet wake from sleep using actigraphy and that trunk actigraphy has never been validated against PSG in the elephant, but as observed in captive studies, inactivity of the trunk is a clear indication of behavioural sleep in the elephant [1, 8]. Moreover, if actigraphy in the elephant does overestimate sleep times, then the results provided herein should be considered maximum sleep times for wild African matriarch elephants. Unfortunately, due to the anatomy of the elephant skull, with a large, extensively trabeculated frontal sinus overlying the brain, that has a depth of up to 30 cm in adults [21,22], the surgery required to implant EEG and other recording electrodes, especially in wild elephants, would be highly invasive, both ethically and technically problematic, and may interfere with other aspects of the elephant’s behaviour that would affect sleep. Thus, we feel the approach taken herein to be the least invasive approach we can currently undertake in order to study sleep in free-roaming wild elephants. Given the results of the current study this approach does appear to be a very useful way to undertake this sort of study that limits any ill-effects on the subjects of study while still providing useful and interesting results that are likely an accurate reflection of sleep in wild elephants. It should be noted here that all implants and collars were removed from the two elephants at the end of the 35-day recording period without detriment to the elephants. \n  \n Comparisons to studies of elephant sleep in the captive setting Our observations of sleep in the wild free-roaming matriarch elephants show features both in common with previous studies of elephant sleep in captivity (Table 1) and significant differences. Similar to observations made in the captive setting, the wild elephants slept mostly at night (between midnight and dawn), showed polyphasic sleep, standing sleep, recumbent sleep, and similar recumbent sleep episode lengths. However, in contrast to the studies in the captive setting, the wild elephants: (1) on average slept substantially less each day; (2) showed several days without any form of identifiable sleep; (3) showed far less recumbent sleep; (4) recumbent sleep did not occur daily; (5) sleep onset and offset times appeared to be related to environmental conditions; (6) appeared to select novel sleeping sites each night (Table 3); and (7) did not show any form of sleep “rebound” in response to disturbances. Our study has demonstrated that the two elephants we recorded appear to sleep somewhere between 1 to 4 hours less than previous reports of total sleep time in captive elephants [2,3,8], and approximately 1.2–1.3 hours less than previous studies in the wild [5]. This finding is perhaps not surprising in the light of similar reductions in sleep times being observed in wild sloths compared to captive sloths [13], and the different methodology used when establishing activity and rest in the elephants in the wild, from focal observations over several months and seasons [5], to the continuous remote monitoring undertaken in the current study over a distinct period of clement weather. In addition, we noted several days without sleep (see below for Discussion), that has only been mentioned once in previous studies of elephant sleep in captivity, and this when the elephants, which were part of a circus, were being moved from one site to another [1]. Recumbent sleep occupied 12–15% of total sleep time in the two wild elephant recorded herein, being between 13–21 minutes per day. Interestingly, recumbent sleep only occurred every third to fourth day, although it has been noted that occasional days without recumbent sleep do occur in captive elephants [12]. The amount of recumbent sleep in the wild elephants is substantially less than the 2.6 h/day [12] and 4.1 h/day [8] reported for recumbent sleep time in the captive setting; however, in agreement with Tobler [8] we found no bias for recumbent sleep to occur on the right or left side. Despite the fact that recumbent sleep only occurred sporadically in the wild elephants, when an episode of recumbent sleep did occur, it had an average length of 38–65 min, which is not greatly dissimilar to the 72 min (African and Asian), 39 min (African) and 66 min (Asian) average recumbent sleep episode lengths reported in the captive setting [8,12]. Thus, when recumbent sleep did occur in the wild elephants, the length of a recumbent sleep episode did not appear to differ markedly from that observed in the captive setting. Unfortunately, the captive setting cannot provide data about the natural environmental conditions, as they differ substantially from the normal habitat of the African elephant, and the captive setting does not allow for the selection of a novel sleep site each night. Thus, there are both interesting similarities (standing and recumbent sleep and similar recumbent sleep episode lengths) and differences (reduced standing and recumbent sleep times, sleep not occurring each day, recumbent sleep occurring every few days, environmental conditions predicting sleep onset and offset times, novel daily sleep sites, and lack of rebound when sleep deprived) when comparing sleep in wild and captive elephants. These lists of similarities and differences highlight two important points in the field of comparative sleep studies. First, studies of “exotic” species in the captive setting, such as elephants, can reveal basic features of sleep in the species studied that can be translated to studies of sleep of the same species in their natural habitat. As such, captive studies provide information that is of importance in understanding the results of studies of sleep in the natural habitat and what features should be measured and examined carefully (such as standing and recumbent sleep in the elephant). Second, it is important to consider that the captive setting likely will not reveal the full suite of potential behaviours and factors associated with and affecting sleep in the natural habitat. This in turn makes quantitative data of sleep studies in the captive setting unreliable for the formulation of theories and correlates of sleep in an evolutionary context (e.g. [13]). Thus, sleep studies in captivity and the natural habitat can work in concert in order to arrive at data that is truly reflective of the various aspects of sleep in a particular species of interest. While this is not always readily achievable, especially for smaller species, it appears that currently this bilateral approach is achievable for larger mammals (e.g. [23]). \n  \n Are elephants really the shortest sleeping mammals? At 2 h per day, the total sleep times recording for the two matriarch elephants in this study are substantially less than that recorded for sleep times in captive elephants and from observational studies of wild elephants (Table 1). The remote monitoring techniques employed in the current study ensured that the elephants recorded from were undisturbed by the experimenters, and indeed, the actigraphy technique tends to overestimate the amount of sleep, meaning that the actual true physiological sleep times in wild elephants might be even lower than reported here. The average total daily sleep time of 2.0 h for these two elephants is less than that reported for any previously studied mammal [24–28], even the significantly larger bodied gray whale that appears to sleep for at least 9 h per day [29], and the giraffe, another large bodied African mammal, which, in captivity, is reported to sleep for around 4.6 h per day [25]. The next shortest sleepers of mammals, after the elephants, appear to be the domestic horse, which sleeps for 2 h 53 min per day [30] and the domestic pony, which sleeps for 3 h 20 min per day [31]. Thus, at present, it appears reasonable to conclude that the elephant is, as far as we know, the shortest sleeping mammal. The regressions of body mass against total sleep time presented earlier in this manuscript appear to provide perhaps the most direct explanation of the 2 h total sleep time for elephants. While 2 h per day does fall well below the regressions created (Fig 1), it must be noted that these regressions are based mostly on data obtained from captive animals and that in their natural habitat these animals likely sleep far less than in captivity (e.g. [13]). Thus, if we had enough data of total sleep time from mammals in their natural habitat, it would appear that total sleep time in the elephant might be reliably predicted from such a regression. \n  \n REM sleep is likely to be unusual in the elephant The question of REM, or paradoxical, sleep in the elephant remains open, mainly due to the difficulties in determining REM sleep without polysomnographic recording, which as mentioned above would be extremely difficult to undertake in elephants; however, our findings do have some bearing on this issue. The only previous report of REM sleep behaviours in sleeping elephants was provided by Tobler [8], who indicated that signs of REM sleep, such as twitches and jerks of the ears, leg, tail and trunk, as well as irregular breathing and occasional loud vocalizations, were observed only during recumbent sleep; no signs of REM sleep were reported for standing sleep. In mammals more generally, one of the principal polysomnographic signs of REM sleep is muscle atonia [14]; thus, it would be reasonable to a priori presume that REM sleep in the elephant likely only occurs when it is in recumbency, as it would require muscle tone to maintain the standing sleep position. The domestic equids have been reported to enter REM sleep when in lateral recumbency and not in standing sleep [30,31], but a later report indicates the possibility of brief episodes of REM sleep while standing as well as longer REM sleep episodes during sternal and lateral recumbency in the horse [32]. If it is true that the elephant only experiences REM sleep when recumbent, then the findings of the current study indicate that the elephant will only enter REM sleep on every third or fourth day on average. As described above, both wild elephants only experienced recumbent sleep for 10 out of the 35 days of recording, limiting their potential opportunities to enter REM sleep if this only occurs during recumbency. This would then indicate a very different way of obtaining the necessary amount of REM sleep in the elephant compared to that seen in other mammals studied to date, with REM sleep not occurring each day. Given the capacity for the storage and recall of memories by the elephant [33], this potentially intermittent form of REM sleep, where elephants can exhibit no potential REM sleep for up to 9 days (Fig 3), may pose additional problems for functional interpretations of REM sleep related to memory consolidation [34,35]. For the elephant, this would mean that the absolute maximum percent of TST that is occupied by REM sleep would be 12–15%, which appears high compared to its close relatives the manatee (1%) [36] and the rock hyrax (0.4%) [37], but less than that seen in domestic equids which show REM sleep in lateral recumbency (~24%) [31]. In addition, the fact that when recumbent sleep did occur in the wild elephant the episode lengths are similar to those reported in the captive setting (see above), adds additional support to the concept that REM sleep only occurs in recumbency in the elephant. An absence of REM sleep for up to 4 days has also been reported for the walrus [28]. As an alternative explanation to REM sleep only occurring every 3 to 4 days in the elephant during recumbent sleep, standing sleep in the elephant may show some resemblance to sleep seen in birds, with short sleep episodes showing roughly 90% slow wave sleep and 10% REM sleep, often while standing [38], or in the domestic horse, with brief episodes of REM sleep (16–23 s) occurring during standing prior to arousal [32]. In this possible scenario, REM sleep could occur on an almost daily basis in the elephants while in standing sleep (except for those days with no sleep at all), but may occupy a small percentage of total sleep time (similar to that seen in the closely related manatees and hyraxes). This possibility is supported by the existence of a unique medially located subdivision of the locus coeruleus complex [16], which, hypothetically, could continue to depolarize during the potential standing REM sleep episodes (while the firing patterns of the remainder of the typically mammalian locus coeruleus neurons follow a standard mammalian pattern and do not depolarize during REM sleep episodes), and thereby maintain just enough muscle tone for the elephant to have short episodes of REM sleep without needing to be in recumbency. During these hypothetical short episodes of standing REM sleep the elephants may be leaning against trees or rocks for support and balance, as has been noted in observational studies of elephant sleep in the wild and captive settings [4,8], and this hypothetical standing REM sleep may coincide with the periods of “bobbing”, “weaving” or “swaying” movements of the head noted during standing sleep [4,8] similar to the neck lowering and leg buckling seen in the domestic horse [32]. In this scenario, recumbent sleep may represent periods where sleep intensity is much higher than during standing sleep. Unfortunately, the true nature of REM sleep in the elephant will only be determined once the technically and ethically difficult polysomnographic recordings have been made, but whatever the outcome, it appears clear than REM sleep in the elephant will be unusual in comparison to that seen in many other mammals. \n  \n Days without sleep One of the more remarkable series of observations made in the current study were the days without sleep observed in the two elephants studied. A total of 5 out of 70 days of recording (3 days for Matriarch 1, and 2 days for Matriarch 2) showed no clear signs of sleep. These days appeared to be associated with major disturbances to the elephants. The elephants showed no signs of inactivity/sleep for periods averaging 46 h 21 min, with clear signs of the animals being agitated for 10 to 16.5 h (based on increased speed of whole body movement and higher trunk activity levels). During these times the elephants traversed an average distance of 30.31 km from the beginning of the disturbance through to the time when activity and body speed levels returned to close to normal, thereby putting substantial distance between themselves and the location of the initial disturbance. Similar periods without sleep have been observed in the walrus [28]. There are three equally possible circumstances that may have caused these nights without sleep. In the Chobe National Park it has been well documented that particular large lion prides predate upon elephants [39,40]. While these lions most often predate upon male elephants aged between 4–15 years [39,40], these elephants are still associated with a herd led by a matriarch. Therefore, it would be of importance for the matriarch to lead her herd a long way from danger. Thus, predation pressures from lions may be one root cause of the nights without sleep. A second possibility is poaching of elephants by humans [41], which would likely cause a similar lack of sleep and major movement of the elephant herds led by the matriarchs from which we recorded. A third possibility is that the herds may have been disturbed and subsequently harassed by a bull elephant in musth. As the elephant herds may contain oestrus females they would be attractive to a bull in musth, and the persistence of the bull elephant over time in his attempts to mate would also explain the large distance traversed by the matriarch and her herd during these nights without sleep. Whatever the root cause of these disturbances, it is clear that wild female elephants are likely to experience roughly 7% of their nights without any signs of sleep. Further to this, there appears to be no specific sleep “rebound”, in terms of an increased total sleep time, or increased amounts of recumbent sleep, in the days following these nights without sleep and sustained increased activity. Thus, the loss of a night’s sleep does not appear to have a detectable or distinct effect on elephant sleep as far as can be determined from what we have recorded. Despite this, it is possible that following these nights without sleep, the potential sleep deficit might be compensated for by increased sleep intensity, i.e. deeper sleep rather than longer sleep. This might be tested in future by placing collars on the elephants that allow for remote activation of a stimulus (such as a vibrating collar) that would awaken the animals and thus provide arousal thresholds between different nights of sleep, and even different types of sleep (standing vs recumbent) in the elephant. \n  \n Environmental conditions and sleep Having recorded sleep in the natural habitat of the elephant we were very interested in whether any of the weather and lunar parameters measured showed specific relationships to the sleep data accrued during the study. For the most part, sleep durations, onsets, offsets and sleep types appeared to occur independent of individual weather and lunar parameters, but both ambient air temperature and relative humidity appeared to be related to sleep onset and offset times. These relationships became far stronger when a multifactorial measure, the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT, calculated using ambient air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation) that provides an estimate of the perceptual gestalt of environmental conditions, was used. In fact, WBGT explains between 67 to 80% of the variance in sleep onset times, while WBGT explains approximately 94.5% of the variance in sleep offset, or awakening, times. These results clearly indicate that sunrise and sunset times are not the cues driving the onset and offset of sleep in the elephant, and that this gestalt measurement of perceived environmental conditions is a far more accurate predictor of when elephants will enter or awake from sleep. This observation would be strengthened by the study of additional elephants, especially large males, and during different seasons, but the strength of the explanatory value of this perceived environmental condition is clearly of interest not only for elephants, but for other species sleeping in their natural habitats. Recent observations of San people living a traditional, pre-industrial, lifestyle also indicate that solar light levels do not influence the timing of sleep onset or awakening, rather ambient air temperature better explains sleep onset and offset times [42]. Thus, it appears that sleep onset and offset times in large diurnal mammals are best explained by factors such as ambient air temperature and relative humidity, or a gestalt measure of perceived environmental conditions, rather than sunrise and sunset. Further investigations across different species will test the correlations observed in elephants and humans living a traditional lifestyle and see how generally applicable these correlations prove to be. These correlations do not exclude entrainment of general circadian rhythms by light in large mammals in their natural environment, but rather explain the timing of sleep in the daily cycle of these species. A potential relationship between recumbent sleep and the days (±7 days) around the new moon is apparent for the two elephants recorded from (compare Figs 3 and 10). We observed that 70% of recumbent sleep time (15 out of 26 episodes) occurred when the face of the moon was less than 50% illuminated, but this relationship was not statistically significant. Such a relationship would of course be of interest, as it would indicate that recumbent sleep would preferentially occur in the elephant during the periods when lunar illumination is as it lowest, thereby making the elephants less detectable to predators allowing them to enter a form of sleep where the risk of predation would be higher, as it would take time to stand up and escape potential attack. Similarly, weak trends to less total sleep time around the full moon and more sleep around the new moon were noted. However, these potential relationships remain speculative and require further investigation to determine if these potential relationships are indeed real. Despite this, it appears that environmental conditions do play a major role in shaping sleep in the wild free-roaming elephant and that lunar phases may also have an effect.

All those hours spent searching for grasses, roots and fruits means there's little time left over for sleep. \n  \n How little? Try two hours a day for African elephants in the wild, a new study found. If confirmed, that would be the shortest-known sleep time of any land mammal. \n  \n These herbivores can also regularly go nearly two days without sleeping at all, according to the paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. \n  \n Researchers followed two free-roaming female elephants inside Botswana's Chobe National Park. They outfitted each matriarch with an \"actiwatch\" — like a Fitbit for elephant trunks — and a collar with a gyroscope to monitor the elephants' sleep times and sleeping positions. \n  \n Paul Manger, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand, with an African elephant. Image: paul manger \n  \n Their study — tiny as it is — is one of the few to look at elephants in their natural habitats. Previous research has mainly involved elephants in captivity, and earlier observational data doesn't always distinguish between resting times and actual sleep. \n  \n A better understanding of how elephants behave in the wild can help inform and improve wildlife conservation efforts, said Paul Manger, lead author of the new study and a neuroscience professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. \n  \n \"As we build up more information, the ideas for conservation will become stronger and guided by real data — and not just people's gut feelings,\" he said by phone from Johannesburg. \n  \n For the study, Manger and his colleagues tracked the two matriarchs over 35 days. \n  \n With the \"Fibits,\" the researchers could measure how frequently the elephants moved their trunks throughout the day — moments they called \"acceleration events.\" \n  \n If the trunk didn't move at all for three minutes or longer, it suggested the animal was asleep. An African elephant's trunk can weigh between 270 to 290 pounds, so the appendage is unlikely to twitch or flop around as the pachyderm catches some z's. \n  \n The gyroscope-equipped collar told researchers if the pachyderms were standing and moving around, or lying down on their side, their preferred sleeping position. \n  \n The study suggests that African elephants in the wild sleep fewer hours than their peers in captivity. Earlier studies found that captive elephants can sleep between 3 to 7 hours, although some of that might include quick naps or moments of rest. Other small studies on elephants in their natural habitats estimated elephants spent 0.67 to 2 hours a day sleeping on their sides. \n  \n The difference in sleep times between elephants in captivity and in the wild likely has to do with food, Manger said. \n  \n African elephants can eat on the order of 700 to 900 pounds of food a day. If you're in a zoo, that grass is delivered daily by the bale. If you're in the wilds of Botswana, it might mean walking around 20 miles a day in a quest for calories. \n  \n \"The larger the body size, the more food they need to literally shove into their mouths each day to keep themselves going,\" the professor said. \n  \n A two-day-old baby Asian elephant gets an early start on a life of plant eating. Image: SEAN GALLUP/Getty Images \n  \n The team next hopes to study male African elephants in the wild. Unlike females, which tend to roam in a more confined space, male elephants can traverse across country lines, making it more complicated to gather data. \n  \n The team also plans to study multiple females in the same group, to see if they take turns sleeping in a kind of \"cooperative vigilance,\" Manger said. \n  \n Throughout Africa, elephants are in danger due to hunting and human population growth. Populations of all elephants have plummeted from about 1.3 million in the 1970s to less than 500,000 today. \n  \n A tiny study on elephant sleeping habits won't change this dark reality. But every bit of more accurate data can help improve efforts to protect endangered wildlife. |||||\"", "output": "The sample size was small—and so were the findings. Researchers asked the question \"Does large body size make elephants the shortest mammalian sleepers?\" and sought to answer it in the wild, in a departure from most previous related research, which involved elephants in captivity. After tracking two wild African elephant matriarchs in Botswana's Chobe National Park for 35 days, they found the creatures averaged just two hours of sleep daily, \"the shortest ... of any mammal recorded to date.\" The study, published Wednesday in PLOS ONE, describes elephants as \"polyphasic\" sleepers, meaning they sleep multiple times a day, though most of their sleep occurred between 2am and 6am. As for the quality of that sleep, oof: Elephants slept in a recumbent position only every three or four days, with the other sleep occurring in a standing position. That \"potentially limit[s] their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis,\" per the researchers. And on five occasions, the elephants were tracked as being awake for as many as 46 consecutive hours and \"exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep.\" The amount of sleep they got had no correlation with their amount of daily activity; they were tracked traveling as many as 19 miles in 10 hours, \"possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching.\" Mashable notes that previous studies have pegged the sleep time for elephants in captivity at 3 to 7 hours, and lead author Paul Manger says the quest for food is probably the differentiator. \"As we build up more information, the ideas for conservation will become stronger and guided by real data—and not just people's gut feelings,\" he says.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to come up with good comebacks. Can you provide 16 detailed steps?", "output": "At some point, everyone has to deal with put-downs from others. Whether it's a bully at school or a nasty coworker, we've all been insulted at some point. Some people say nasty things to get attention, and in some cases, the best response is just to ignore them. If that isn't working though, at some point you'll need to respond. A good comeback, whether humorous or earnest, can sometimes put a stop to a bully's insults.\n1. Consider the situation.: The first step in determining how best to respond to any insult is think about the situation and the source of the insult. How best to respond will depend on what's going on.\nIf the person who is insulting you is a friend and is joking around, feel free to joke back! If he has actually hurt your feelings though, you may want to discuss that. If this person is really your friend, he will not want to hurt you.\n2. Decide on an approach.: If the person is a bully or someone else who wants to hurt your feelings, decide if you want to ignore her or respond. If you want to respond, you have a few options:\n\nMake a funny comeback to make her feel foolish.\nMake an earnest comeback aimed at stopping the behavior.\nTry to have a conversation with her to try to get at the root of the problem.\n3. Listen closely and think of a way to make the other person look foolish.: To make a good humorous comeback, you need to respond directly to what the other person said to you. A comeback that is off topic won't be effective or funny. People won't get it, and you'll be the one who ends up looking silly.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in thinking about what you are going to say next and not really pay attention to what the other person is saying, especially if what the bully is saying isn't very nice. Try to pay close attention to what he is saying about you. His insults should provide the basis for your comeback.\nA good comeback is one that makes the other person look foolish for insulting you. Think of something that will turn the other person's words back on him.\nFor example, if someone calls you ugly, you could respond by saying: \"Too bad you can't Photoshop your ugly personality.\"\nIf someone makes a joke at your expense, you could respond: \"Bet you were up all night thinking about that one.\"\nIf someone insults your ability or skill at something, you could say: \"Well, I learned by watching you.\"\n4. Show disdain or amusement.: Before delivering your comeback, you need to show that the insult hasn't hurt you — on the contrary, you should make it apparent that you think what the bully has said to you is stupid. Your look has to match your words.\nUse your body language. Raise an eyebrow, laugh, roll your eyes. Anything to show how ridiculous you think the other person's words were.\n5. Respond quickly.: For a funny comeback to work, you have to get it out right away. If you are halfway down the hall before you think it up, it won't be effective.\nIf you don't come up with a funny comeback right away, it's better to just save it for another time. If this is an ongoing problem, there's a good possibility you'll have another chance.\n6. Remain professional.: If the bully you are responding to is someone you work with, stand up for yourself. Do not, however, cross the line into being unprofessional.\nIn a workplace situation, for example, a good comeback might be one one that points out how the bully's behavior is hurting productivity. Don't make one that that mocks her appearance or intelligence. You might say, \"If you put as much effort into your work as you put into making fun of me you might not be behind on your project.\"\n7. Take a breath.: Sometimes a more earnest response is a better one — an insulting comeback can end up provoking more of the same (or worse). You still, however, need to show the bully that you aren't hurt by his words, even if you are.\n\nTake a deep breath. If you are angry, try to let the feeling go. Anger is what the bully wants to see, so don't give in and show it.\nTry to put on a \"poker face\" that doesn't reveal any feelings one way or the other. You can practice this in the mirror at home to make this easier.\n8. Act confident.: When you respond to the bully, show that you are confident. It's not just that you aren't angry or hurt — you feel fine about yourself and and confident in your response.\n\nStand up straight, and look the bully in the eye. Speak in a calm, clear voice.\nYou can tell the person insulting you something like: \"Your words don't affect me,\" or, \"I don't let people like you get to me.\"\n9. Show you aren't hurt.: Respond verbally with a comment that shows that the insult hasn't hurt you, or that the bully's words are unimportant to you. Here are some good examples:\n\nI heard you, but I don't care.\nYou're wasting your breath.\nReal mature.\nAre you done?\nWow, you discovered I look different than you.\n10. Consider shaming the other person.: You might consider a response that promotes feelings of shame for the bully. Ideally, you can make her feel bad for insulting you. Here are some examples:\n\nI feel sorry for you.\nBuild up your self-esteem some other way.\nYour parents must be really proud of you.\nIt's sad that you feel a need to do this.\n11. Ask questions to start a conversation.: Some people have found it effective to respond to insults with questions aimed at making the other person open up about the real problem. If you think the person insulting you might be open to a conversation about the real issues that are upsetting him, this might be worth a try.\nFor example, if someone calls you stupid, you might respond by asking: \"What is it exactly that makes you feel I am not intelligent?\" Even if this doesn't start a heart-to-heart conversation about the bully's own feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, it might disarm him just by being unexpected.\n12. Practice your comebacks.: Comebacks are all about timing and confidence. Most people think comebacks have to be spontaneous, but you can improve yours by practicing.\n\nFind a friend or a sympathetic adult and have her deliver the insults so you can practice your responses. If you don't feel comfortable with this, you can try it on your own in the mirror.\nNotice which style of comeback feels most natural to you. If you struggle to come up with a funny one-liner in the moment, then using this tactic will not be very successful for you. Use a different response — like a poker face and saying \"Are you finished?\" if that comes more naturally. Use what works best for you until you can practice and use the other methods effectively.\n13. Learn a little about your bully.: Bullies are usually very socially intelligent and great people-readers. They can easily see which comments get under people's skin. You can benefit from building up this same skill, but using it for defense instead of for aggression (like the bully). Watch the bully's reaction when you deliver your comeback and the reaction of others around him. Did he respond with surprise? Become angry, quiet, walk away? Then the comeback style used was successful. \n\nWatch for patterns and make note of what worked and what didn't. Notice, for instance, if humor seems to egg him on. If this is the case, switch to indifference or seriousness.\nUse the group dynamic to take control over the situation. Did the reactions of others watching tell you that you made an impact? Then what you said is working. Did they laugh at you and continue to support the bully? Then try a new tactic.\n14. Don't become the bully.: When you are thinking about comebacks, try to come up with ideas that insult the bully's behavior, not characteristics she can't change. Your goal isn't to be as mean as the bully; your goal is to make the put-downs stop.\nDon't use stereotypes or attack a person based on her gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, or other characteristics such as these. This is just as bad as what the bully is doing to you, and possibly worse. You can also get in a lot of trouble for using these kinds of insults.\n15. Be careful not to provoke violence.: Sometimes comebacks can lead to more insults. More concerning, however, is that some bullies might respond with violence, especially to insulting comebacks. Keep an eye out for signs that the person is becoming aggressive.\n\nThink carefully about the comebacks you use, and if a violent reaction seems like a possibility, remove yourself from the situation. Do you know if this person has ever gotten in trouble for violence before? Have you heard about him hitting or fighting with others? Or is he a social bully who just uses words? If you know this person has gotten violent in the past, you will want to be very cautious.\nWatch for physical cues of violence. The person may touch his head or face (rubbing his face or scalp or almost touching his face) and clench his fists, wring his hands, or pop his knuckles. The bully may remove an article of clothing, like a hat or a jacket, and may crouch down slightly. In addition, the person may turn his non-dominant side toward you; so, a left-handed person may turn his right side toward you. If you notice any of these behaviors, do not try to make a comeback and back away from the person.\nDo not make comebacks to threats of violence. The bully may threaten to hit or beat you, so remain confident. Don't look like you're scared. Instead, get away from the bully and report the threat to a trusted adult.\n16. Get help.: If someone is bullying you regularly get help from a teacher, manager, or coworker. Bullies are less likely to pick on you if you aren't isolated.\nIf you can't solve the problem informally, get someone in a position of authority involved. You shouldn't have to deal with constant insults from a bully in any situation.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brotherinlaw, Carlos Benjamin Bratt. Walters apartment is just across the street from an elementary school—an obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki Kyra Sedgwick, one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying I didnt hurt them. Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment. Walter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas Mos Def. Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames Candy Kevin Rice, is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin Hannah Pilkes who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walters life takes a further downturn when a suspicious coworker, MaryKay Eve, learns of his conviction. She prints out his police record and posts it on the bulletin board at the mill for everybody to see. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense. Ostracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father. In her anguish, and sensing a similarity between her father and Walter, she offers to sit on Walters lap, wanting his approval. Walter finally understands the pain he caused his victims, and tells Robin to go home; as she leaves, she gives him a hug. On his way home, he sees Candy dropping off a young boy near the school at night. In a fit of rage and selfhatred, Walter gives Candy a thorough beating. Afterwards, he goes to Vickis home, and she accepts him. Soon after, Lucas visits Walters apartment as Walter is packing to move in with Vicki and tells him that a man was beaten across the street the night before, and asks if he knows anything about it. Walter denies any knowledge, but Lucas knows better. He reveals that the boy gave a very good description of the assailant, which fits Walter. He also reveals that Candy is wanted in Virginia for raping a young boy. Lucas decides not to charge Walter with the assault. With Carlos help, Walter is reunited with his sister, whom he has not seen in years. However, she refuses to forgive him and leaves. In a voiceover discussion in which his therapist Michael Shannon tells him that eventual forgiveness may take several years, Walter replies that he understands and accepts her anger, and expresses optimism for his own future.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What are some steps to cope when your parent is at hospital with a severe illness?", "output": "No matter what age you are, seeing a parent in hospital who's suffering from a serious condition is always a stressful and upsetting time. You feel helpless because they are helpless and vulnerable. This article is written for you, with the hope that it may provide some helpful advice on how to cope in such a situation.\n1. Chill out in between hospital visits.: Taking a simple jog or run can clear your mind and help you feel at ease. Exercising also releases endorphins, which help induce calming - if not exactly 'happy' - feelings.\n2. Eat regularly.: Don't skip meals! You must take good care of yourself in order to have the energy needed to look after your loved one, and to cope emotionally. Sugary foods like chocolate are beneficial for coping with shock or stress, while berries and soups boost your immune system - many people can catch serious infections simply from visiting the hospital on a regular basis. Stay strong.\n3. Use this time to understand the relationship you have with your parents.: You may have to take the role of responsible adult while they're in this powerless position, just as they did for you when you were young and vulnerable. Be patient, and you be will rewarded with insights that will help to create a stronger bond between you.\n4. Visit your parent with another family member, or a close friend who understands what you're going through.: For support. If you wish, you may request some time alone with your parent; this can provide comfort for some people.\n5. Write.: Writing out your thoughts and feelings is an important part of dealing with your situation, as if you don't get your feelings out in a constructive manner, you will only end up lashing out at someone else, and this doesn't help anyone.  Start a journal or diary just for this occasion and decide whether or not you would like to share this with family members or your parent.\n6. Be in good company.: Keep yourself surrounded by a support group of those who care about you and understand what you are going through. Go out for a meal, stay in and cook a meal, share a cup of tea or coffee, or work on a project together where possible. Don't be afraid to spend time on your own if you need some space to think, but don't become a recluse as this can damage your already fragile emotional state.\n7. Be kind to yourself.: Perhaps you've already spent, or are spending, several hours at the hospital. The air in hospitals can be drying, so make sure to bring plenty of bottled water with you to keep hydrated.  Give yourself time to take walks in or around the hospital. If you visit the hospital along with other family members, consider starting a rota so that everyone can take some time out to relax.\n8. Be educated.: Read about your parent's illness and know what the next steps in the process might be. Prepare yourself as best you can for what may come next. Tell your parent that you love him/her as often as possible.\n9. You may have to cancel a lot of well-planned appointments.: Try not to feel frustrated about it but rather, use the experience to reflect upon how your parent must have met all of your childhood demands uncomplainingly when they, too, may have had tight schedules to consider. Doing this will help provide you with a sense of uniqueness and let you know just how dearly you've always been loved by them.\n10. Pray: It doesn't matter what religion you are - or whether you have a religion at all. This is a spiritual appeal to something greater than yourself, a way of expressing your feelings in the form of a prayer, either to a god/gods/goddesses or just the Universe itself.  It will help you get through this difficult time.\nHope for the best. Sometimes the best thing you have is hope.\n11. If you feel okay with it (keep in mind that some people don't) visit your parent as often as possible and talk to them.: They can tell you what's happening and reassure you.\n12. Cry: Crying is cleansing and helps release pent up emotions, washing bottled up 'stuff' out of your system. Don't be afraid to let the tears out; the supportive people you surround yourself with will understand.\n13. Talk to your parent's doctor/nurse or carer.: They'll know about the treatment they're being given and they'll be able to answer any questions you might have.\n14. If the illness is severe, and you are the primary carer, you will have to be ready for care if and when they're discharged.: Schedule accordingly, keep a small note pad and pen handy at all times, and keep a diary and record of medications and reports (in a file) as they may be needed later on as they progress with sessions.\n15. Stay positive.: There's much to be said for remaining positive, as best you can, in this situation.  Your parent may be fretting about the burden their situation has placed upon you. Remember, they're not used to this role reversal after having spent a lifetime being the responsible adult for you. If they can see or sense that you're 'holding up' and being positive, it can help alleviate some of that worry. The benefit for you is this: nothing is ever hopeless and the end only paves the way for a beginning. There is always hope.  Positive thinking, if nothing else, alleviates some of the wear and tear of stress on you.\n16. Prepare yourself for what may lie ahead.: Be prepared, but don't let forethought feel like you're giving up. Sadly, nothing can prepare you emotionally for a deterioration in a loved one's state. Being practically prepared, however, will mean far less stress for you and those around you, in the event the worst case scenario occurs. Consult the physician or nurse in charge and ask them to explain risks and any possible side effects which may arise from treatments.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Passengers will be able to view real-time 3D renderings of the landscapes currently beneath them as they make their way from Deutschland to the City of Gold.\nSurely an absolute dream come true for any regular flyer.\nOn top of high quality 3D renderings, the prototype VR program will also allow passengers to learn more about the locations they are currently flying over.\nFor instance, as you find yourself over Vienna, you could choose to take a ride on the Prater Ferris Wheel, or attend one of the classical concerts that made the city famous, all through 360 photos and videos.\nIt was Hoger’s question that sparked the pursuit of finding a way to give passengers the ability to view mountains, lakes and cities that their plane is passing over – day or night, sunny or cloudy – no matter what the conditions were like outside.\nVR was the answer to delivering that experience to Lufthansa’s customers.\nBringing VR into the travel experience is by no means a new idea. One Japanese company is using VR to let you ‘travel’ to Paris without actually leaving the ground via a VR experience that even includes in-flight meals. International travelers at JFK can use Periscape’s VR Tower as a way to escape the craziness of an airport as you wait for your flight.\nHowever, those are all land-based VR experiences. Lufthansa wants to take VR and put it in the clouds by making it part of your in-flight experience, combining real-time data, the position of the airplane and 3D images to deliver a truly memorable flight.\nThe VR Moving Map experience operates on the Samsung Gear VR using a smart phone app designed by 3Spin that can access on-board flight data through a wireless local area network via an on-board server.\nHere’s the thing, VR Moving Maps isn’t just the glass bottom airplane experience – though that alone is pretty hard to top. You’ll also be able to virtually explore the cockpit of the Airbus A330 and tap into information about the current flight speed and height, the outside temperature and how much longer until you reach your destination.\nThe team at Lufthansa sees VR as a growing trend for destination experiences, and they aim to use VR technology to further enhance the in-flight experience for their customers.\nIf you’re curious and want to get a sneak-peek of Lufthansa’s VR Moving Maps, you can view the route from Frankfurt, Germany to Dubai in 3D at the ITB Travel Show. Or you could try out the prototype during Lufthansa’s FlyingLab, an on-board flight conference that will let you test innovative flight technology.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What are some tips to alleviate tailbone pain?", "output": "1. Visit your physician for an examination.: Your doctor will know what to look for when evaluating tailbone pain. He may take x-rays or order CT scans or an MRI. The two most effective tests in diagnosing coccydynia are the injection of a local anesthetic into the tailbone area, to see if that temporarily relieves the pain, and comparing x-rays taken sitting and standing, to see if the coccyx is dislocating when you sit.\nYour doctor could also look for pilonidal cysts, which are cysts that occur only in the tailbone region, and are caused by infection of ingrown hair follicles. Successful treatment of these kinds of cysts may help relieve pain or remove pain altogether.\n2. Familiarize yourself with the symptoms associated with tailbone injury.: You will need to visit your doctor for a diagnosis, but knowing the symptoms may help you determine if your tailbone is causing the problem. Identifying symptoms could also give your doctor valuable information. Symptoms of tailbone injury include: symptoms:\n\nPain in the tailbone or coccyx  pain in the lower back\nPain when rising from a seated position to a standing position\nFrequent need to defecate or pain while defecating\nRelief of pain when sitting on legs or only on one buttock\n3. Consider potential causes of your tailbone pain.: If you injured your tailbone in some way, tell your doctor about it during your appointment. It may help your doctor to determine the correct treatment for your situation.\nBy some estimates, coccydynia is roughly five times more common in women than it is in men. This may be due to injuries to the tailbone that may occur during childbirth.\n4. Ask your doctor about prescription drugs.: Some medications may help to alleviate pain in your tailbone. For example, anti-epileptics and antidepressants have been found to be effective at alleviating tailbone pain. Ask your doctor about the possibility of taking one of these medications.\nKeep in mind that opiates are not typically given unless there is a fracture to the tailbone. If you have fractured your tailbone, your doctor may prescribe a prescription painkiller to help alleviate the pain. An x-ray would be required to determine if you have a fracture in your tailbone.\n5. Consider surgery if all else fails.: Most patients who undergo surgery to relieve coccygeal pain have already tried nonoperative treatments with little effect. Exhaust the nonoperative options before you move on to painful, and sometimes debilitating, surgery.\nIf the pain is severe enough, occurs daily for 6 months or more, and/or it interferes with your quality of life, then request a referral to an orthopedist who specializes in removal of the coccyx.\n6. Ice the area.: Apply a towel-wrapped bag of ice, an ice pack, or a bag of frozen veggies to your tailbone for 5-10 minutes at a time. This may help to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. For the first 48 hours after an injury to your tailbone, you can apply ice once per hour that you are awake. After 48 hours you may apply ice for comfort, 3-4 times daily in the same manner.\nBecause your tailbone doesn't have a lot of padding over it, you may only be comfortable icing the area for about 5 minutes at a time.\n7. Use an over the counter painkiller.: Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to reduce pain and swelling. These over-the-counter (OTC) products, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be purchased at any pharmacy or drugstore.\nTake 600 mg of ibuprofen every eight hours, or take 500 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours. Do not exceed 3500 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.\n8. Correct your posture.: Poor posture may be contributing to your tailbone pain. Try to sit upright, with your core engaged, your neck straight, and your back slightly arched. If you get a sharp pain when getting up from a sitting position, lean forward and arch your back before rising.\n9. Sit on a cushion.: Special cushions, with a section cut out underneath the tailbone, are designed especially for patients with tailbone pain. This may help relieve some of the pain associated with sitting down.     It is possible to make your own cushion from a piece of foam rubber.  Just cut out a hole in the center so it is shaped like a toilet seat.\nCushions shaped like a doughnut are not found helpful by most patients, as they are designed to relieve pressure on the genitals rather than the tailbone. Talk to your doctor about use of a wedge-shaped pillow.\n10. Apply a heating pad.: Studies show that applying heat to the tailbone area may decrease pain. Use a heating pad up to 4 times per day for 20 minutes each time.\nTry a warm compress or hot bath if you do not have a heating pad.\n11. Plan for a period of rest and recovery.: If it turns out that you have a tailbone fracture, there is no cast that can be placed on the tailbone. You will just have to rest and avoid any strenuous activities for about eight to 12 weeks. If you have a physical job, you may need to arrange to take some time off from work while your body heals.\n12. Refrain from straining during bowel movements.: Some people experience pain while defecating as a result of tailbone pain. Do your best to avoid constipation by getting plenty of fiber and fluids in your diet. If necessary, take a mild stool softeners while your tailbone is healing.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is the most efficient way to store baklava? Could you provide a list of 13 steps?", "output": "Although baklava originated in the Middle East, it won over the tastes of people around the world with its layers of filo held together by honey or syrup. And with its relatively long shelf-life, it can be stored and enjoyed months after baking. Whether you're storing leftover baklava or you want to freeze it before it's baked, there are a few ways to ensure it retains all of its delicious flavors.\n1. Remove your baklava from the oven and it into a wide, shallow, and uncovered container. Cooling is especially important when the weather is rainy or humid.\n\nDuring the summer, cool your baklava in the refrigerator immediately after baking it. This gives them time to cool before exposing it to room temperature conditions.\nDon't store your baklava at room temperature for more than 5 days.\n2. Place your baklava into a pan and cut it into squares or rectangles. Afterward, cut across each piece diagonally to create triangular pieces.\n\nPour your favorite syrup over the baklava after cutting them. You can also wait until you are ready to eat them to do so.\nLet your baklava sit for 5 minutes before eating.\n3. Place 2 pieces of baklava onto parchment paper. Afterward, place another piece of parchment paper on top, and add another 2 pieces of baklava on top. Finally, top off the batch with another 2 baklava pieces, and place a final piece of parchment paper on top.\n\nLimit your batches to 4 to 6 baklava pieces so you don't have to defrost all of them at once.\nAlways separate each layer with a piece of wax or parchment paper.\n4. Take your baklava layers and place them gently in a container. If you're using a container like a cookie tin, wrap a layer of aluminum foil around your baklava pieces to prevent damage. Don't crowd the container. If the baklava doesn't fit, take out 1 or 2 pieces or try a different kind of container.\n\nMark the date onto the container or bag.\nAvoid ceramic containers—their porous nature lets air inside, which can accelerate aging.\n5. After making sure the container is completely closed, store it somewhere cool in your kitchen or in the refrigerator. Test your baklava regularly using a food thermometer. Be sure that it doesn't rise above room temperature.\n\nKeep your baked baklava at room temperature if you like a crispy texture.\nStore your baklava in the refrigerator if you like a chewy texture.\n6. Line a baking pan with an equally sized piece of parchment paper. Gently place your unbaked baklava onto the pan. Take care not to break it apart.\nIf you don’t have parchment paper, grease your baking pan with ⁄2 to 1 tablespoon (7.4 to 14.8 mL) of olive oil.\n7. Place the uncovered baking pan into the freezer. Check on your baklava every hour or so. Gently touch it with your finger to determine if it is frozen. Once the baklava is completely frozen, remove the pan from the freezer.\n8. Remove the pan from the freezer. Gently lift the baklava from the parchment paper and wrap it in 4 layers of plastic wrap. Place the plastic wrapped baklava back onto the pan and into the freezer for up to 4 months.\nThrow out the parchment paper after removing the baklava.\n9. When you're ready to cook your baklava, remove it from the freezer and take off the wrap. Afterward, place it on the pan and put it into the refrigerator for about 1 hour.\nYou can also leave the baklava on the counter at room temperature for about 1 hour to thaw it. However, this is less ideal, especially in humid conditions.\n10. After defrosting your baklava, butter the sides and bottom of a baking pan with a cooking brush. Afterward, place your baklava onto the pan and brush the top with butter. Cut the baklava into squares or rectangles, and then cut across them diagonally to create triangles.\n\nPour your choice of syrup over the baklava after removing them from the oven.\nLet your baklava sit for 5 minutes before eating.\n11. Place all your baked baklava into a shallow, wide container right after they get out of the oven. Afterward, place the uncovered container into the refrigerator to cool. If you put your baklava right into the freezer, it will decrease the temperature of other foods items, which can ruin their taste and texture.\nFreezer-safe bags also work. Just be careful that your baklava doesn't get crushed by other foods in your fridge.\n12. Place 2 pieces at the bottom of the container. Afterward, place a layer of parchment paper on top. Continue this process until the container is full and top it off with a final piece of parchment paper.\n\nKeep your batches to 4 to 6 baklava pieces. This lets you defrost them in small batches instead of all at once.\nBe sure to keep each layer separated with a piece of wax or parchment paper.\n13. Put your batch of baklava into the freezer until you want to reheat them. Once it's time to eat them, put them in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours or overnight to thaw..\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "The Role of Ronald Reagan in Supporting Trade and Immigration Respond in 23 sentences.", "output": "In the many eulogies to Ronald Reagan since his passing, virtually all acknowledge his role in defeating Soviet communism and reviving America’s self-confidence. But another aspect of Reagan’s record that should not be forgotten was his commitment to keeping America open to trade and immigration.\nReagan’s vision of an America open to commerce and peaceful, hardworking immigrants contradicts the anti-trade and anti-immigration views espoused by Lou Dobbs, Bill O’Reilly, Pat Buchanan, Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, and many others who claim to speak for the conservative causes Reagan largely defined.\nIt was the Reagan administration that launched the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1986 that lowered global tariffs and created the World Trade Organization. It was his administration that won approval of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1988. That agreement soon expanded to include Mexico in what became the North American Free Trade Agreement, realizing a vision that Reagan first articulated in the 1980 campaign. It was Reagan who vetoed protectionist textile quota bills in 1985 and 1988.\nDuring Reagan’s eight years in office, Americans eagerly expanded their engagement in the global economy. In 1980, the year before Reagan became president, Americans spent a total of $334 billion on imported goods and services and payments on foreign investment in the United States. By 1988, his last year in office, American spending in the global economy had nearly doubled, to $663 billion. If Reagan was a “protectionist,” it had no discernable effect on the ability of Americans to spend freely in the global marketplace. Fittingly, one of the major federal buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue is named the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.\nLike most post-war presidents, Reagan championed free trade while selectively deviating from it. Critics of trade note correctly that Reagan negotiated “voluntary” import quotas for steel and Japanese cars and imposed Section 201 tariffs on imported motorcycles to protect Harley-Davidson. All true. But those were the exceptions and not the rule. They were tactical retreats designed to defuse rising protectionists pressures in Congress.\nReagan’s words and deeds regarding immigration were equally expansive. At a ceremony at Ellis Island in 1982, he spoke movingly of immigrants who “possessed a determination that with hard work and freedom, they would live a better life and their children even more so.” As with trade, Reagan’s record on immigration was mixed. He signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which included stepped up border enforcement and sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. But that legislation also legalized 2.8 million undocumented workers.

Centre is the deepest position in the league and it’s likely there are teams with an excessive amount of centres that you can trade for. However, if you’re too cheap to address your needs through trade you can look to the waiver wire for the Leafs’ “number 1 centre”. Grabovski is currently riding a three game goal streak and has goals in six of his last seven games. He has 23 points on the season and is miraculously a plus player, even on the lowly Leafs.\nThe young Oiler was the buzz of the league with a fancy, yet completely pointless spin-o-rama during a shoot-out against the Lightning in his first game in the NHL. He has four points in four games, although three of those came in one game against the Blue Jackets. He scored 26 points in 26 games in the AHL and even scored 5 goals in one game… against the Toronto Marlies (making the big club proud). With Shawn Horcoff out for an extended period of time the talented Swede should get a good look on the top two scoring lines.\nEarlier this year Pacioretty stated that he would rather play on a scoring line in the AHL than a checking line in the NHL. That caused every old-timer’s head to explode, except it shows that Pacioretty understands his talents and knows the role he’s best suited for. The Canadiens recently called him up to the NHL and are giving him every chance to play in a scoring role – currently using him on the second line with Gomez and Gionta. Before his call-up Pacioretty was leading the AHL in scoring with 17 goals and 15 assists in 27 games. He’s since added a goal and an assist in two games with the Habs.\nThe Anaheim D-man is second in rookie scoring by a defenceman with 17 points, although he’s not going to help you in the +/- department as he’s sporting a -6. Regardless, he’s averaging more ice time (22:16) than any other rookie and averages over 3 minutes a game on the power-play. He should be able to produce solidly from the backend for the rest of the season and will receive some consideration for rookie of the year.\nMeszaros currently leads the league in +/- with an impressive +22, along with 13 points, accumulated all while playing on the third pairing of Philadelphia’s defence. With Chris Pronger’s injury, Meszaros has joined Matt Carle as the Flyers’ top-pair. He’ll receive more power-play time, although he’ll now be facing tougher competition meaning his +/- might take a hit.\nIf you don’t have a good goalie already you’re in trouble. Owners are generally unwilling to give up their goalies and if you are persistent enough to score one it’s likely you overpaid. Furthermore, most goaltending battles are decided by December and if they aren’t, you probably don’t want either combatant. With that in mind Jose Theodore looks poised to take over the starter’s job from Niklas Backstrom in Minnesota. The former Vezina winner has a .915 SV% along with a 2.71 GAA. Hopefully you aren’t picking up Theodore as a starter.\nUh, scratch that...it looks like Backstrom has a firm hold of the number 1 job.

The celebration continues for five days and recognizes a time of year when in Hindu mythology, good overcame evil. Diwali is celebrated by cooking traditional foods and desserts, meeting with family and friends, and decorating the house with color and lights.\tThe tradition of decorating with light doesn't only serve to illuminate houses, but also represents an invitation to the Hindu goddess of good fortune to bring happiness and health into the home. Families will light small, handmade earthen oil lamps called diyas. Diyas are bowl-shaped and usually made of clay, but when clay isn’t readily available, it is easy to make and decorate diyas at home. Even if you don’t celebrate Diwali, you can make your own diya to decorate and light up. Making diyas is a popular family activity, and everyone can decorate their own!\n1.

{"input": "What do we know about Barry Sherman and Apotex?", "output": "An autopsy concluded last weekend that the billionaire couple died from ligature neck compression, or hanging or strangulation with a ligature. Homicide investigators have taken over the case, but it hasn’t been labelled a homicide.\n“There are only two possibilities,” David Perry, a 28-year veteran of Toronto police’s homicide and sexual assault squads now working as a private investigator, told the Star. “These two people died at their own hands or somebody else’s.\nThe bodies of Barry Sherman, 75, founder of generic drug giant Apotex, and his wife, 70, were discovered in their North York home on Dec. 15. Their deaths were deemed “suspicious” and an investigation began.\nThough it’s still early in the case — Perry was quick to note that it’s been just over a week since the bodies were found — he recalled cases he’s worked on or reviewed where police didn’t rule a death one way or another because they could not say with 100-per-cent certainty that it was a suicide, a death by misadventure, or a homicide.\n“So the case kind of stays open,” he said. “Sometimes, everybody looking at the case would agree on a theory about what happened — but they didn’t have the evidence to support it.\n“You might know the manner and the mechanism of how somebody died, but you’re not sure at whose hands,” Perry said.\nEven in cases where a determination is made, the public can still be left without answers. An intentional explosion in Mississauga last year that destroyed dozens of homes and killed the centre house’s inhabitants — Robert Nadler and Diane Page — prompted similar questions to the Sherman case. Was it murder-suicide? An accident?\nIn the end, Nadler’s and Page’s deaths were deemed double suicide. There had been speculation during the months-long investigation that the explosion was Nadler’s idea — he had a past criminal record including a conviction for a Peel Region murder decades before. Investigators found no evidence to suggest that was the case. No one can know for sure what happened inside that day, and whether one spouse persuaded the other to go along with it.\nIn other cases, such as the case of Cameron Bailie, the cause of death could remain unknown. Bailie’s body was found in Lake Ontario in the summer, after he disappeared from his Oshawa home in January. His death remains listed as “unexplained” following the autopsy, Staff Sgt. Bob Elliot of Durham Regional Police said Saturday. The toxicology report could offer more insight, but it has yet to be completed, he added.\nEven when a death is ruled a homicide, it may still go unsolved. Of the 61 deaths ruled as homicides this year in Toronto, 36 remain unsolved, according to the Toronto police website. Twenty-eight of the 74 homicides in 2016 and 18 of the 57 homicides from 2015 also remain unsolved.\nIn the Sherman case, another possibility Perry floated was that police were prepared to make an announcement, but are holding back “out of respect for the family,” to let them grieve and bury their loved ones before an announcement was made.\nThe family has criticized media reports of police sources divulging an early theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide.\n“Given the high-profile nature of this case, and the fact that the family is already concerned about what the police have said and what police sources have said, I think they’re going to make sure that they’ve really got it right before they make any announcements,” Perry said.\nBeyond the police investigation, the Sherman family has sought the help of lawyer Brian Greenspan to conduct an independent investigation into the couple’s deaths.\nMeanwhile, police continue their investigation at 50 Old Colony Rd., the Shermans’ house near Bayview Ave. and Highway 401.\nPolice have inspected the roof and taken one of the Sherman’s cars away for examination. A car search could be looking for signs of a struggle, blood, or any other evidence to hone the investigation, Perry told the Star.\nOn Saturday, investigators took their search underground to the sewer system. Sewer searches can sometimes find objects that someone tried to stash, an officer stationed outside on watch the Sherman house told the Star.\nA Toronto police spokesperson, Allyson Douglas-Cook, said there were no new announcements from homicide about the case Saturday.\nIn the days since his death, Barry Sherman has been remembered as a generous philanthropist, as well as a shrewd and litigious businessman. Under his leadership, Apotex launched hundreds of lawsuits against competitors.\nIn one of Apotex’s most high-profile battles, the company went head to head with Dr. Nancy Olivieri, a blood disease specialist at SickKids who was researching the drug deferiprone as an alternative treatment for thalassemia, a disorder that can lead to unsafe buildups of iron.\nOlivieri and Dr. Gideon Koren, the discredited doctor at the centre of the Motherisk scandal, were running a clinical trial for Apotex.\nWhen Olivieri, the lead researcher, raised concerns about the efficacy and potentially life threatening risks of the drug, Sherman’s company threatened legal action and pulled funding for her clinical trial. Neither Apotex nor Koren, who would later disparage Olivieri and her supporters, shared her concerns.\nIn the years that followed, lawsuits were launched by both parties. It was more than a decade before Olivieri and Apotex settled in 2014.\nResearch integrity and patient safety were at the heart of the issue, said Arthur Schafer, a University of Manitoba professor and the founding director of the school’s Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics, who supported Olivieri as an unpaid ethics consultant throughout the legal battle.\n“The company was ruthless,” he said, adding that neither the University of Toronto nor SickKids supported Olivieri and in fact attacked her integrity when she came under fire from Apotex.\nWhile Sherman may have “sincerely believed” Olivieri was wrong, the case doesn’t “say much for his concern about patient safety or research integrity,” Schafer said.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Like microscopic cockroaches, cancer cells are able to fit through inconceivably tiny gaps. Two new studies bring scientists closer to understanding this ability, and their insights may open up new treatment options for aggressive cancers.\nTo study their movements, two independent teams of researchers at New York’s Cornell University and the French Institut Curie set up miniature obstacle courses to watch cancer cells make their way through tight gaps. Their research, published in a recent issue of Science magazine1, shows that cancer cells can squash through tiny holes, as narrow as a quarter of the cell’s width, by shattering their nucleus – a compartment that protects the cellular DNA. This causes their DNA to temporarily leak into the cell plasma before the cells can restore their nucleus. Cells with low levels of lamins – structural components of the nucleus that act as stabilisers – are more likely to pop their nucleus. This might help them form more invasive and aggressive cancers.\nHowever, nucleus flexibility comes at a price: leaked DNA is often damaged and needs to be repaired for the cell to survive the stress of the tight squeeze. The researchers show that blocking both DNA and nucleus repair mechanisms kills the cells that were damaged by moving through tight gaps.

His reply is a photo of American neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell, implying that he aligns with the infamous fascist leader.\n“I do not have any political affinity for hate groups,” MacDonald said in a phone call.\nIt’s unclear how he would have unknowingly stumbled upon the obscure racist meme, and why he shared it without knowing who Rockwell was. MacDonald stopped responding to Mediaite when asked how he initially found the meme.\nAn apparent Nazi sympathizer organizing Stewart’s meet and greet is the latest development in the nominee’s ties to the alt-right and America’s white supremacist movement as a whole.\nAn extensive Mediaite report from June found that the neo-Confederate candidate for Senate hired a white supremacist family tied to the League of the South to work on his campaign, both as his security and for fieldwork consulting. Stewart also has been seen spotted with white supremacists all over Virginia during his campaign events.\nFollow the author on Twitter (@calebecarma).", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain what meta-analysis is and how judgement calls can affect the results. Respond in 9 sentences.", "output": "A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. Meta-analysis can be performed when there are multiple scientific studies addressing the same question, with each individual study reporting measurements that are expected to have some degree of error. The aim then is to use approaches from statistics to derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on how this error is perceived. Existing methods for meta-analysis yield a weighted average from the results of the individual studies, and what differs is the manner in which these weights are allocated and also the manner in which the uncertainty is computed around the point estimate thus generated. In addition to providing an estimate of the unknown common truth, meta-analysis has the capacity to contrast results from different studies and identify patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light in the context of multiple studies.\nA key benefit of this approach is the aggregation of information leading to a higher statistical power and more robust point estimate than is possible from the measure derived from any individual study. However, in performing a meta-analysis, an investigator must make choices which can affect the results, including deciding how to search for studies, selecting studies based on a set of objective criteria, dealing with incomplete data, analyzing the data, and accounting for or choosing not to account for publication bias. Judgment calls made in completing a meta-analysis may affect the results. For example, Wanous and colleagues examined four pairs of meta-analyses on the four topics of (a) job performance and satisfaction relationship, (b) realistic job previews, (c) correlates of role conflict and ambiguity, and (d) the job satisfaction and absenteeism relationship, and illustrated how various judgement calls made by the researchers produced different results.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

This time, we celebrate Arcade Fire’s entire catalogue by revisiting all 79 of their anthems.\nFrom the very first notes of their debut album — those gleaming wind-chime like synths, the chugging guitar, the regal piano — Arcade Fire became one of those remarkably few life-changing, era-defining bands in indie rock history. Their songs soared, creaked, ached, and roared, breathing vibrant, triumphant life and passion.\nFor nearly a decade and a half, the Montreal-based band have continued to push and challenge themselves, drawing from their own confrontation with personal crisis and giving us access to things we might have been ignoring within our own lives. But always retaining the emotional core, their “us against the world” anthems, and their arena-propelling hooks.\nRetaining the title of indie champion is a difficult thing, however, and on the back of less-than-stellar reports of their soon-to-be-released fifth album (and a since-refuted dress code for their live show, not to mention the increasingly noxious marketing campaign), the naysayers have turned out in full force. Though we won’t be ranking the songs of Everything Now particularly high on this list, to write off the album, let alone the band’s catalogue as a whole, would be a serious mistake.\nIn fact, looking at their entire catalogue reveals the commonalities between the satirical maximalism of Everything Now and their austere debut Funeral and everything in between.

Your task is to summarize them.\n\"Audience members listen as President Barack Obama delivers remarks at Kotzebue School, Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015, in Kotzebue, Alaska. Obama is on a historic three-day trip to Alaska aimed at showing solidarity... (Associated Press) \n  \n KOTZEBUE, Alaska (AP) — President Barack Obama crossed the Arctic Circle on Wednesday in a first by a sitting U.S. president, telling residents in a far-flung Alaska village that their plight should be the world's wake-up call on global warming. \n  \n Obama's visit to Kotzebue, a town of some 3,000 people in the Alaska Arctic, was designed to snap the country to attention by illustrating the ways warmer temperatures have already threatened entire communities and ways of life in Alaska. He said, despite progress in reducing greenhouse gases, the planet is already warming and the U.S. isn't doing enough to stop it. \n  \n \"I've been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of a changing climate, but you're already living it,\" Obama told a crowd of more than 1,000 in this rough-and-tumble town on Alaska's western coast. \n  \n As he closed out a three-day tour of the state focused almost entirely on climate change, the president sought to show solidarity with Alaska Natives and rural Alaskans whose immense challenges are rarely in the national spotlight. His brief visit had the feeling of a campaign rally, with throngs of people cheering and applauding when he invoked the historic nature of the first presidential visit to the Arctic. \n  \n From the moment Air Force One touched down in Kotzebue, examples of dire poverty and climate-related obstacles were easy to spot. Obama's motorcade snaked through the town passing rows of rusting shipping containers and dilapidated huts - almost all on stilts to accommodate gusts of wind and other weather-related events. \n  \n It was a topic Obama brought up, by way of praising Alaskans for their perseverance despite poverty, isolation and a lack of support. He said while many speak of America's pioneering, independent spirit, in Alaska it's not just a slogan but a way of life. \n  \n \"It can be harsh,\" Obama said. \"That means that you depend on each other.\" \n  \n Obama came to Alaska with no grand policy pronouncements or promises of massive federal aid. Instead, he sought to use the changes to Alaska's breathtaking landscape to put pressure on leaders in the U.S. and abroad to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as he works to secure a global climate treaty that he hopes will form a cornerstone of his environmental legacy. \n  \n Temperatures in the Arctic are rising twice as fast as anywhere else on earth, Obama said. Permafrost, the layer of frozen ice under the surface, is thawing and causing homes, pipes and roads to sink as the soil quickly erodes. Some 100,000 Alaskans live in areas vulnerable to melting permafrost, government estimates show. \n  \n As he flew to Kotzebue from the fishing village of Dillingham, Obama directed Air Force One to descend so he could get a closer look at the 400-person village of Kivalina, where residents have voted to relocate the entire village as it sinks into the water. \n  \n \"Think about it,\" Obama said. \"If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we'd do everything in our power to protect it.\" \n  \n Obama ticked through his favorite sights from his tour of Alaska — the receding glacier in Seward, the spawning salmon in Dillingham and the cockpit of a tiny float plane. He took particular pleasure in reminding Alaskans that, on the eve of his visit, he'd renamed the famed Mount McKinley, the continent's highest peak, to Denali, its traditional name. \n  \n Alaska Natives have joined the president in sounding the alarm on climate change. Yet the obstacles they confront daily in rural Alaska extend far deeper, raising questions about whether the federal government has done enough to help. \n  \n \"The cost of living here is very high. We live off the land,\" said Red Seeberger of the Inupiaq tribe. \"But we still live by our culture.\" \n  \n Alaska officials say well over $2 billion in federal and state funds have been spent over the last 50 years to bring indoor plumbing to rural Alaska, but the challenge is finding money to build water and sewer systems in nearly three dozen village that still lack them. \n  \n As Obama's travels brought him near the Bering Sea, U.S. officials reported the presence of five Chinese PLA Navy ships in the sea — the first time they have been observed there. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said U.S. officials didn't view the Chinese vessels as a threat but added that the reason for their presence was unclear. \n  \n In an earlier visit Wednesday to Kanakanak Beach in Dillingham, Obama inspected all aspects of the fishing operation and pronounced a sample of salmon jerky to be \"outstanding.\" He took it in stride when a salmon spawned on his shoes, quipping that the writhing fish \"was happy to see me.\" \n  \n ___ \n  \n Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP ||||| Five Chinese navy ships are currently operating in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, Pentagon officials said Wednesday, marking the first time the U.S. military has seen Chinese naval activity in the area. \n  \n The officials have been tracking the movements in recent days of three Chinese combat ships, a replenishment vessel and an amphibious landing ship after observing them moving toward the Aleutian Islands, which are split between U.S. and Russian control. (Latest News: Chinese Navy Ships Off Alaska Passed Through U.S.... ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story Stories from Our Advertisers \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n WASHINGTON — Five Chinese Navy ships were sailing in international waters of the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska on Wednesday, in what Pentagon officials said was the first such foray by Beijing. \n  \n The move came on the last day of President Obama’s three-day visit to Alaska, in which he became the first sitting president to travel to Arctic Alaska. The White House said that the intent of the Chinese operation was unclear, but that the Pentagon had not detected any threatening activities. \n  \n The foray may be more about economics than defense. The Arctic has become hotly contested as the United States, Russia and China, among other nations, have expanded their economic and security interests. A growing number of vessels have been traveling north through the Bering Strait, and the Coast Guard has diverted ships from other core missions to manage the traffic. \n  \n A Pentagon official noted that China has every right to patrol international waters, adding that American warships often ply waters off the coast of China. “I wouldn’t call this something we are very worried about,” the official said. He said that American officials had identified a Chinese amphibious ship, three surface combatant ships and a replenishment vessel in the Bering Sea. \n  \n Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Defense Department respected “the freedom of all nations to operate military vessels in international waters.” \n  \n The operation, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, came as China has been increasingly flexing its military muscle, particularly off its own coast. Beijing has increased military spending and is working on an aircraft carrier. Last year, Chinese officials took Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary at the time, on a tour of the carrier, the Liaoning. Many American officials interpreted the move as an effort to project naval power, particularly in light of tensions between Beijing and its neighbors over disputed islands in the East and South China Seas. \n  \n China is also developing stealth fighters, and it has continued to reclaim islands in the two seas at a brisk pace. |||||\"", "output": "Bad timing? In what the Pentagon says is a first, five Chinese warships were spotted in international waters in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska yesterday as President Obama visited the state, reports the Wall Street Journal. Defense officials say they're not entirely sure what the Chinese vessels are doing in the area of the Aleutian Islands, but they are not considered a threat or a major concern and the US respects \"the freedom of all nations to operate military vessels in international waters in accordance with international law,\" the New York Times reports. Analysts tell the Journal that the sighting is another sign of China's shift toward having a \"blue water navy\" that regularly sails far from its own shores. In another first, President Obama became the first sitting US president to cross the Arctic Circle yesterday, the AP reports. \"I've been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of a changing climate, but you're already living it,\" he told a crowd in the town of Kotzebue. He has used much of his Alaska visit to sound the alarm on climate change, and to call for more American icebreakers. Earlier in the day, Obama visited the fishing town of Dillingham, where he joined local schoolchildren in a traditional dance. In what was almost certainly another first, a salmon spawned on the president's shoes when he picked it up, prompting a resident to quip that it was \"happy to see him,\" reports the Alaska Dispatch.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "\"What is the Ember and how can it help with mobile night photography?\"", "output": "Want to keep up with Ember and be notified when it hits the market? Like us on Facebook!\nWe’re thrilled to introduce the premiere tool for mobile night photography: the Ember. The smartphone revolution has changed the way we connect, and introduced a whole new kind of photography to the world. With powerful cameras in reach of our pockets, snapping and sharing photos has become the new norm. Despite these leaps forward in mobile technology, photo and video taken at night still miss the mark. Limited by battery life and a single LED, built-in flashes often function better as a flashlight than a photography tool. The Ember sets a new standard for mobile night photography by providing soft, warm light that enhances color, clarity, and overall quality of photo and video shots.\nDesigned for night photography, the Ember is a continuous light tool contoured to the shape of the iPhone 5 and 5s. The back panel illumination provides a soft, warm light that makes night time photos worth sharing in the morning.\nThe Ember’s design was inspired by the function of professional fill lights, used by photographers and videographers to illuminate their subjects. The 56 LEDs provide light that’s 10x brighter than the iPhone’s flash, and the built-in diffuser softens and spreads light evenly resulting in a flattering glow. The Ember's soft, warm light brings out sharp details, natural skin tones, and vibrant colors that harsh flashes miss. The included warming filter allows for added richness and the optional color filter pack gives you full control over color temperature.\nThe Ember operates separately from the iPhone, allowing you full independent control over your light. Eliminate unwanted shadows, add drama, or achieve creative light effects by taking your iPhone out of the Ember and positioning the light from any angle.\nFrom the moment a friend referred filmmaker Jedd Goble to a little known app called Instagram, he was hooked on mobile photography. Impressed by the quality of photos the iPhone’s camera captured, he could be seen snapping share-worthy shots all the time. It wasn’t long before Jedd noticed that the iPhone flash wasn’t delivering the same great results he got where light was abundant. Having experience in lighting scenes for video over the years, Jedd wished that he could have something with the power of a portable fill light designed for use with the iPhone. An avid mobile photographer, he also sought compatibility with tripods and clip-on lenses.\nThese ideas became drawings and sketches, and what started on paper soon became plastic and silicon as we manufactured our first prototypes. Our version 1.0 unit acted faithfully as our proof of concept for the light. Over the next four months we experimented with upgraded internal components, allowing us to test the performance of different printed LEDs, as well as the configuration of the plastic body and functional components such as filters. The team joined in the adventure as it has grown, and now we’re asking for your help to bring the Ember to market. Make a pledge and join our campaign to capture the night.\nWe're currently field testing the prototypes featured in our project images, made by our early stage manufacturing partners in Guangdong Province. Our whole team is committed to creating a high quality product while insuring socially and environmentally responsible practices throughout our supply chain.\nEvery manufacturing project can encounter challenges, and we’re working hard to make certain our back-end processes are efficient and meet our high standards for quality. We’ve worked with electronics manufacturing services, plastics providers, engineering firms, and supply chain experts to strategize the best paths from manufacturing to distribution. As a living project with many moving parts, any issue such as short supply of key components or shipping delays could impact our delivery date. We’re closely monitoring our campaign to make sure we can scale our Kickstarter-round of manufacturing appropriately.\nOur goal is to have all Kickstarter rewards shipped during the month of July. If we encounter any delays along the line, you can find details under the Updates tab.\nThanks so much for your part in making the Ember a reality! Stay in the loop with private backer-only updates and get invitations to exclusive night time photo walks in the SF Bay Area.\nReceive the Ember Pro Package, be memorialized on our website, and have a skype session with the Ember team.

{"input": "I need to become a babysitter, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you give me 17 actionable steps?", "output": "If you love being around kids and are looking to make some extra cash, becoming a babysitter can be a great idea. However, whether you’re 12 or 24, you’ll be a better babysitter if you take the time to prepare for the role. To ensure the safety of the kids you watch and the success of your babysitting career, you should evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, get appropriate training and certifications, and make sure you line up gigs that suit you well.\n1. Babysitting may seem like “easy money,” especially if you have experience watching younger siblings at home. However, it is a real job that can have very real consequences if you’re not prepared or mature enough to handle it. Ask yourself questions like: \n\n“Am I old enough?” — Most families will be uncomfortable hiring a babysitter who is young, so you may have to try harder to earn their trust than other babysitters.\n“Am I mature enough to watch kids by myself?” — You need to have focus, stamina, and emotional control to be able to successfully babysit kids. Even if you’re a young teen, you need to be able to be the adult in the room.\n“Can I dedicate myself to the job?” —  Babysitting takes a lot of time and energy, so make sure you can handle the stress and the time taken away from things like schoolwork.\n2. This may seem silly, but ask yourself directly: “Do I like being around kids?” If you can’t answer with an enthusiastic “yes!” you should find another way to make some money—maybe by doing yardwork around the neighborhood.\nAlso ask yourself things like: “Can I change a diaper?”; “Do I know when kids start walking?”; “Do I know how to calm a child who bumps an elbow or scrapes a knee?” If your answers are \"no,\" seek advice from, and opportunities to observe and assist, friends and family with small children.\n3. Great babysitters all have their own individual skill sets, and different babysitting gigs call for different abilities. However, there are some general qualities that nearly all good babysitters have, including:\n\nThe ability to communicate with kids. Do you know how to speak simply, calmly, directly, and positively with a child?\nRespect for differences. Are you comfortable around people who may have different lifestyles, belief systems, or economic backgrounds than yours?\nA willingness to be a good role model. Can you be someone who kids will look up to and want to emulate?\n4. As a babysitter, you must be willing and able to make quick decisions to ensure the safety and well-being of the kids you’re watching. Often, the kids won’t like it, but you must be able to do what is best for them. In fact, sometimes you must be willing to upset the parents in order to do the right thing. \nFor example, if you see signs of potential abuse—for instance, frequent, unexplained bruises; fear of physical contact or undressing; unsafe living conditions—you must be willing to act. You need to confide in an adult you trust and work with them to call a child abuse hotline or the police.\n5. In some places, there may be few restrictions on who can be a babysitter. In other places, you may need to complete specific training programs and be licensed by the appropriate government authority. Before you begin trying to get babysitting gigs, make sure you meet the requirements where you live.\n\nThere may, for instance, be age restrictions in your area that you don’t yet meet.\nAsk other babysitters for information on regulations where you live. Also call or check the website of the health, human services, or similar department of your local government.\n6. Whether or not a training program certification is required where you live, you’ll find it much easier to get babysitting jobs if you are certified. Certification lets parents know that you’ve put in the time and effort to become a knowledgeable, professional babysitter.\n\nLook for in-person or online certification programs from reputable organizations, such as (in the U.S.) the American Red Cross.\n\nYou must be at least 11 years old to take the Red Cross babysitting certification course. The course costs around $40-$50 USD.\nLocal colleges or universities might also offer certification programs.\n7. In some cases, First Aid and CPR certification might be included within your babysitting certification. If they aren’t, it’s worth your time to get these certifications as well. Doing so will make you that much more prepared—and appealing to potential employers.\nThe American Red Cross, for instance, offers First Aid and CPR certifications in conjunction with babysitting certification, but they aren’t required. Red Cross First Aid and/or CPR courses cost in the $80-$100 USD range.\n8. You’ll probably be given a handbook as part of a babysitting certification course. Keep this guide as a handy reference as you look for, and eventually take on, babysitting jobs.\nThe American Red Cross offers a 50-page emergency handbook for download.\n9. Before taking on paid babysitting jobs, try helping out a family member or friend with childcare responsibilities. And, if possible, see if you can “tag along” with an established babysitter on one of their jobs. This way, you’ll get a feel for the responsibilities involved without yet being the person in charge.\n\nMake sure you get the permission of the family before “tagging along” on a babysitting gig. If they’re willing to pay you a little, great. But expect it to be an unpaid volunteer experience.\nAlso keep in mind that you're there to learn, not to hang out with your friend who happens to be a babysitter.\n10. Some babysitters focus on watching kids, while others also care for pets, prepare meals, do some light cleaning, and so on. Figure out exactly what type of babysitting jobs you’d like to do by asking yourself questions like: \n\n“What age range of children would I like to work with?” -- For instance, are you comfortable working with infants?\n“How many kids am I willing or able to care for at once?” --  For a new babysitter, one kid can often seem like plenty!\n“Am I willing to care for pets as well?\" -- If so, just cats and dogs, or more exotic pets like birds or reptiles?\n“How far am I willing to travel to babysit?” -- How are you going to get to your gigs, and how much will it cost you in time and/or money? If you don't drive yet, you may need to rely on a parent or someone else to get you to your jobs.\n“How late can I work, and which days of the week can I work?” -- You might want to limit yourself to weekends and no later than 11 pm, for example. If you're a teen, this is also something you'll need to work out with your parents.\n11. A babysitting resume can be a simplified version of a full career resume, and usually only needs to be a single page long. List your contact information at the top, then categories like “Education,” “Certifications,” and “Experience.” Print out a copy of the resume to bring to each interview you do. \nUnder “Experience,” list some quick details (age and number of children, hours/days watched, etc.) for previous babysitting jobs. If this is your first resume and you haven’t worked any solo gigs yet, describe your experiences watching siblings or cousins, helping out another babysitter, and so on.\n12. Rely on your network of family friends, neighbors, your parents’ work colleagues, and other people who already know you to get your first babysitting jobs. If you need some help finding leads, talk to older siblings or their friends who are babysitters. \n\nEspecially if you’re a pre-teen or teen, you should not try to advertise your services online or by posting flyers around town. It can be unsafe to share your address and/or contact information publicly.\nIf you’re 18 or older, you might consider signing up for one or more of the several websites that help connect babysitters with jobs; for instance (in the U.S.), https://www.sittercity.com/babysitters or https://www.care.com/babysitters.\n13. All parents want their children to be watched by a babysitter who is trustworthy, mature, and reliable. So, when you have the opportunity to interview with a potential employer, put your best foot forward by arriving on-time and ready to chat. \n\nIt’s fine to dress in age-appropriate clothes, but make sure they’re clean and relatively modest. You want to look a little mature for your age, but not like you’re trying to pretend you're an adult already (unless you are one!).\nShow some enthusiasm for the job by being friendly and engaging. If you’re nervous, take a few deep breaths before knocking on the door.\n14. A babysitting interview should definitely be a two-way interview. That is to say, you should also be asking questions, not just answering them. Make sure this opportunity and this family is right for you by asking things like: \n\n“Will you always be back by 10 pm, or would I be expected to work past that sometimes?”\n“Would I be giving the children baths and putting them to bed?”\n“Would I need to feed, watch, and let out the dog as well?”\n“Are there foods or snacks that are off-limits for your kids?”\n“Is your youngest child fully potty-trained yet?”\n15. The average pay rate for babysitters in the U.S. is around $15 USD per hour, but this can vary widely by location. Ask other babysitters in your area how much they charge per hour. Use this information to determine how much you want to charge, as well as the minimum amount you're willing to accept for the gig.\n\nIf you have to travel a fair distance to get to the job, factor in things like travel expenses as well. You might want to ask for $5-$10 per shift for fuel, for example.\nIf you're new to babysitting, expect to start at a lower rate than experienced babysitters. After you prove your reliability, you can ask for a raise.\n16. You may want to get these key details in writing—at the very least, make sure you and the parents are completely clear and in agreement on them. You might want to ask them directly: “So, I’ll work every Friday and Saturday from 6-10 pm and not later, you’ll pay me $15 per hour in cash each night, and I can reach you at any time at 555-555-5555. Is that right?”\nMake sure they provide you with a backup number (for a relative, neighbor, etc.) if they can’t be reached for some reason, and clarify when it would be appropriate for you to call emergency services.\n17. During or right after the interview, ask if you can meet the kids and spend a little bit of time with them. Even better, ask if you can drop by for a couple hours sometime and observe the family in action at home. Doing so will help you get a good impression of the kids and the expectations the parents have for their care.\nNot all kids and families are going to be the best match for you. If the kids seem like they’re more than you can handle, or if the parents seem too demanding (or even not demanding enough), consider looking for another gig.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Can you share your thoughts on being a woman in motorsport media?", "output": "In all honesty, it has taken me a year or two, dozens of drafts and plenty of requests to write a blog post like this. I think the reason I have been hesitant is because the topic is so subjective, and I just haven’t found the right words to get across the point I am trying to make. Everyone in motorsport, male or female, will inevitably have different experiences in how they got into their current job and the challenges they faced. This is just my version of events and my opinion, that must be made clear before I start.\nGrowing up watching motor racing, I was always aware it was a male-dominated sport. All the drivers were male, as were team principals and very large percentage of engineers and mechanics within the teams. The only media-facing female presence came in the shape of pit-lane reporters and TV presenters, but that was just all I knew from an early age. It never put me off the sport, probably because I didn’t know better at six or seven-years-old, but oddly I never questioned if I could be a part of motorsport; I just assumed that with hard work and determination I would be there too.\nAs I grew older my dreams and aspirations changed, the idea of working in motorsport drifted in favour of becoming a teacher. However, boredom over the summer holidays five years ago resulted in me creating a blog about motorsport, my biggest hobby, with the rest being history. The fact I was a 17-year-old female writing about motorsport on an online platform didn’t even cross my mind when I started writing, I did it because I had passion for the sport and opinions which many of you agreed with.\nSoon my social following began to increase, with it being common for readers to leave comments or their opinions on my work. Of course, amongst many pleasant and supportive messages there would be the odd negative tweet but I would take their thoughts and views on board to make the next piece of work I published better. In some cases, their negativity would ignite a tangent and resulted in an idea for a future blog post.\nHowever, one comment I have never received, that I can recall, is being told my opinion or my work is wrong just because I am a woman. Never. This isn’t me saying that it doesn’t happen, because it does and I have seen it first-hand from female friends and colleagues. I think I must just be super lucky to have a very supportive collection of readers and followers who read my content because they enjoy it. Yes, my gender may be the niche that caused them to find me and my work, but I am hoping they stuck around for the quality of my work and not the fact I am female: that is the goal anyway.\nI am often asked how I find it being a woman in motorsport, but the honest truth is I don’t even think about it when I am on the job. When I am walking up and down a pitlane, interviewing a driver in a media pen or sat in a media centre transcribing, my mind is on a million different things. At the end of the day, I am there because I have the knowledge, the passion and determination to be in that field of work. As many professional drivers will tell you, once the racing helmet goes on and you are in a car on a race track, it doesn’t matter if you are male or female, as long as you are fast. The same goes for me. As long I am asking the right questions and generating quality content, my gender is an irrelevant factor.\nOf course, I will always jump at the chance to be part of initiatives such as Dare to be Different because inspiring and supporting the next generation of women in motorsport is hugely important. Nobody should feel restricted to follow their dreams and aspirations because of something that is out of their control, whether that be gender, age, race, religion or social class.\nTruthfully, I feel that since venturing into the world of motorsport media only a few years ago, there has been a growing number of females beginning to emerge in media roles. Maybe it is just because I am making myself more aware of it, or maybe it is because of initiatives such as D2BD or the FIA’s Women in Motorsport Commission. Either way, it is great to see. In Formula E, the championship I currently dedicate most of my time to, I would go as far as to say that there are more female journalists and contributors to online media sites than there are in most motorsports. I am not sure if it is because the championship is only in its fourth season and advertises itself as being a part of the “future” but either way around 20-25% of people in the media centre on race day in Berlin were female.\nTo me, it does seem strange that a blog post about “being a woman in motorsport” has been so requested: there isn’t really much to say. Yes, I am aware that occasionally I get that “look” from men that maybe work in the garages or I pass in the paddock, but I never pay them much attention. Yes, I often find guys ‘mansplaining’ topics to me, but once I show them I know as much, or sometimes more, than them they will stop or walk off embarrassed.\nI suppose the point I am trying to make is that although to many I ‘dare to be different’ with my career ambitions as a woman, for me my gender is an irrelevant factor into how I do my job, as well as how much I love it and will always have a burning passion to do well within motorsport journalism.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

What updates are coming for Cardano (ADA)?", "output": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder and CEO of Cardano (ADA) has come with a series of updates for Cardano followers. Excited at the upcoming launches, Hoskinson said that the company is coming up with its versions of 1.3 and 1.4. Shelly and Prometheus are also around the corner. He has also left a message for Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.\nThe proposal that will be submitted tomorrow, will start seeing the update in the next few days. The Cardano 1.3 update is going to provide memory improvement and efficiency improvement.\nThe humble crypto enthusist, who is looking forward to the promising Cardano 1.4, said: “Cardano 1.4 is going to be the largest update for Cardano”. The update will be huge for Cardano and it has got to offer “a lot of really good things under its hut”. “We are going to go from file systems that uses about 1.3 million files to store the blockchain to about 44,000. The wallet backend specification has been fully implemented,” said Hoskinson, striving to make Cardano, the best product in the market place.\nThe supposedly largest update is at the moment going through a lot of code refactoring and will improve its quality.\nCardano wrote a parallel code base called Prometheus that is written based on Rust. It is a library of different functionality, which the third party should be able to use for their own product lines. Prometheus’ demo is coming in September. It’s has already been tested on Anroid and IoS devices. He sees Prometheus to be really promising.\nHe also stated that on 15th August, Cardano will announce the introduction of a new product that will be based on Promethus as its core. The product will be based on Google Chrome. So, basically, it will be an extension of Google Chrome.\nFor Shelly, Cardano will be ‘gradually rolling things out’. Shelly has now 21 major work units, some of which can be done in parallel and some can be done linearly, and will come out sometime this month.\nReflecting upon Cardano and Vitalik Buterin’s debate, he said since “Reddit is not the proper place to have a debate”. So, this week, they will be posting a blog post, where Buterin and Hoskinson will be answering each other’s questions. He “hopes to have a vigorous debate with Mr Buterin” to understand about Casper which is still “murky” for Cardano’s understanding, “given that it is coming from multiple sources”.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

At first she adapted wonderfully and didn't get up until morning.  Of late however, things are getting slowly worse. Tonight, she immediately got straight back up so many times that it became a game for her. \nMy question isn't directed around the bed problem directly, but her appreciation of the severity of the matter/bad behaviour. \nMe and mum took it in turns to put her back in bed, explaining that it was bedtime.  Around the fifth time,  mum even raised her voice a bit, but it made no difference whatsoever; the game continued. \nLater still, around the tenth time, sadly I ran out of patience and shouted very loud, before standing over her until she got back into bed. This did break the behaviour cycle, and she went straight to sleep, but now I feel guilty that I lost control. \nGenerally our child behaves extremely well, so I don't believe this is a longer-standing issue. However, I'm curious to know from others with real experience to know how they have handled the same type of thing successfully please?  I'd like our daughter to know when we're being serious.\nMy searches online turn up pages like \"10 ways to make your kid behave\", but the advice is just too general.\nAnswer (for our situation)\nWillow Rex's doll game, and Adam Heeg's answer certainly got things going in the right direction.  We went from putting her back 10 times per night, to around 3.\nOn one occasion our daughter got out of bed, and realising me and mum were both downstairs began banging her bedroom door wildly to get attention.  She banged it hard enough to shut herself in her room, because she couldn't reach the handle enough to re-open the door.  At that point, after walking around the room for a while, she put herself to bed, and has slept through ever since.\nWhile I do not recommend locking a child in their room, I believe the realisation here was that there was no merit/gain in the current behaviour, which is what the accepted answer would have led to in the longer-term.

They are the convex uniform polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the 5 Platonic solids (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. They differ from the Johnson solids, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.\n\"Identical vertices\" means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other: A global isometry of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position. observed that a 14th polyhedron, the elongated square gyrobicupola (or pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron), meets a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid, in which \"identical vertices\" means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types (i.e. each vertex looks the same from close up), so only a local isometry is required. Grünbaum pointed out a frequent error in which authors define Archimedean solids using this local definition but omit the 14th polyhedron.

{"input": "\"Who do you think should be Rookie of the Year?\"", "output": "Who has been the best rookie this season -- Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell?\nWhich rookie postseason star is the real ROY?\nThis year's NBA Rookie of the Year debate, one of the most fiercely contested in some time, has continued raging well after awards ballots were due two and a half weeks ago.\nWhile most rookies either play small roles for contending teams or put up bigger per-game numbers on lottery-bound ones, Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers have been driving forces in their teams' advancing to the second round of the playoffs.\nAs Mitchell and Simmons continue to shine on a bigger stage, let's revisit the question: Who has been this year's most valuable rookie?\nThe case for Mitchell as Rookie of the Year centered largely on his leading role in the Jazz's offense. Utah's 48 wins during the regular season were the most by a team led in scoring by a rookie since the 1989-90 San Antonio Spurs, who won 56 games behind rookie David Robinson (who was 24 at the time, having spent four years in college and two more serving in the Navy).\nA focus on scoring does a disservice to Simmons' involvement in the 76ers' attack. While both Joel Embiid (22.9 ppg) and JJ Redick (17.1 ppg) scored more points than Simmons (15.8 ppg), Simmons ranked fifth in the league with 8.2 assists per game -- more than double Mitchell's 3.7 assist average.\nLast season, I introduced the stat \"combined usage\" to quantify a player's role in the offense as both a scorer and a passer, adding the percentage of the team's plays that he finished with a shot, trip to the free throw line or turnover (traditional usage rate) to those on which he handed out an assist. While Mitchell still comes out slightly ahead, both players played historically large roles for rookies on winning teams.\nAlthough Mitchell and Simmons operated in very different styles -- Mitchell creating primarily for himself, Simmons primarily for others -- their overall offensive value as rookies was similar. Basketball-Reference.com's box plus-minus metric (BPM) gives Mitchell the slight edge (plus-1.3 offensive BPM to Simmons' 1.0), as does ESPN's real plus-minus (plus-1.7 for Mitchell, plus-1.5 for Simmons).\nAlthough Mitchell might deserve the nod as offensive Rookie of the Year, Simmons distinguishes himself at the defensive end of the court. Mitchell entered the league advertised as a strong defender -- that was probably considered his better skill as a prospect -- and lived up to expectations as part of the NBA's second-best defense during the regular season.\nNonetheless, Simmons was the more valuable defender. Part of that is simply about size and positional value. The 6-foot-3 Mitchell naturally matched up almost exclusively against perimeter players, whereas the 6-foot-10 Simmons was one of the league's most versatile defenders. He defended both guard spots and both forward spots at least 20 percent of the time and none more than 30 percent, per Second Spectrum matchup data, which tracks a player's defensive assignment for the majority of a given play.\nThen there were Simmons' box-score contributions on defense. He rebounded nearly 20 percent of opponents' missed shots, making him above average for a power forward. Simmons was one of 16 regular players (minimum 1,000 minutes) in the league to average at least two steals per 100 team plays on defense and block at least 2 percent of opponent 2-point attempts.\nIn an era when few rookies are immediately productive, Simmons, in particular, stood as an exception. His 10.1 wins above replacement player (WARP) by my metric ranked fourth among all rookies in the one-and-done era.\nBy this metric, Mitchell -- 24th in the one-and-done era with 5.2 WARP -- was less exceptional. But switching to RPM supports the notion that this was one of the strongest Rookie of the Year battles in recent memory. Both Simmons and Mitchell rank among the top 10 rookies of the past 18 seasons by RPM wins above replacement (WAR), which dates to 2000-01 -- as does Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics, the likely third-place finisher in Rookie of the Year voting.\nGiven how effective they were during the regular season, it's all the more remarkable that Mitchell and Simmons have both been even better in the playoffs.\nJust as it has become rare for rookies to contribute as much to winning teams as Mitchell and Simmons have, so too has it been out of the ordinary for them to be such big factors in the postseason. Back through 2000, this year's duo ranks among the top six rookies in WARP per game in a playoff run of at least six games.\nMitchell's playoff run has been compared to that of Dwyane Wade leading the Miami Heat to the second round in 2004, and that holds up in terms of advanced statistics. While Wade didn't shoulder as heavy an offensive load as Mitchell, who is finishing an incredible 32 percent of the Jazz's plays in the postseason, Wade handed out 6.9 assists per 100 team plays -- more than double Mitchell's playoff mark. As such, they were similarly valuable in the playoffs.\nWith Embiid sidelined the first two games, Simmons was Philadelphia's best player in a comfortable 4-1 series win over the Heat. Even after a seven-turnover performance in the 76ers' Game 1 loss to the Boston Celtics, Simmons is posting the most WARP per game by a rookie in an extended playoff run since Tim Duncan in 1998.\nIn three of the past four seasons, Mitchell would have been an easy choice for Rookie of the Year, and in 2015-16, his strong RPM would have given him a reasonable case over Towns' superior box score stats. It's to Mitchell's slight misfortune that he happens to be putting together a strong rookie campaign at the same time Simmons has posted one of the best in recent memory.\nFortunately, while only one can win Rookie of the Year, there's plenty of room for both Mitchell and Simmons to emerge as stars in this postseason and beyond.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain how unemployment insurance benefits helped stabilize the US housing market during the Great Recession.", "output": "This home foreclosure was one of millions during the Great Recession.\nTen years ago, millions of Americans were losing their homes to foreclosure and policymakers didn’t know how to help them.\nPart of the problem was that lawmakers didn’t understand why homeowners were unable — or unwilling — to repay their mortgages.\nWas it more tied to rising unemployment or the massive losses in the housing market? Were homeowners not paying their mortgages because a breadwinner had lost their job or were they just so underwater that they were making a rational choice to walk away from an investment they knew they would never recoup?\nA paper that appears in the January issue of the American Economic Review suggests that job loss played a larger role in the problem than previously thought.\nAuthors Joanne Hsu, David Matsa, and Brian Melzer say federal expansions of unemployment insurance benefits averted more than 1.3 million foreclosures between 2008 and 2013. Providing that extra cash to the unemployed was more effective than other federal programs specifically designed during that time to help struggling homeowners avoid default.\nPerhaps it’s not surprising that giving financial assistance to laid-off workers would help them afford to keep making mortgage payments, Melzer said in an interview with the AEA. But nobody realized how big of an impact unemployment insurance could have on stabilizing the housing market. It was also unclear whether homeowners who were severely underwater would keep putting the money into a losing investment when they had a strategic incentive to default.\n(W)hen many homeowners were in a negative equity position, it was exactly at that time that this program that replaced income was having really big effects.\nUnemployment insurance is the third-largest government program to support the needy, behind Social Security and government-sponsored health care. But it sometimes gets criticized for reducing people’s motivation to work. Research by Lawrence Katz and Bruce Meyer suggests the longer that laid-off workers receive benefits, the longer they remain unemployed.\nHowever, there are other social benefits from unemployment insurance, such as helping laid-off workers to keep spending on groceries, gas, and other goods that feed the economy. Also, in the midst of a catastrophic financial crisis rooted in a wave of souring mortgages, unemployment benefits could even help stabilize the $30 trillion US housing market.\nUnemployment insurance benefits are administered at the state level, and not all states are equally generous. There is wide variation in the maximum amount of cash and duration of time that states offer to laid-off workers. Melzer and his co-authors wondered whether more generous states would see an impact on foreclosure rates?\nThey did. Examining housing and labor data from 1991 to 2010, the authors estimate that a $3,600 increase in a state’s maximum regular UI benefits prevents 13 percent of the average layoff-related rise in delinquency.\nThere is wide variation in the benefits states give to unemployed workers. The chart below shows the maximum regular payments states offered in 2010. Hover over each state to see how it compares to what they offered in 1991 (adjusted for inflation), as well as how much they provided under a federal expansion of unemployment benefits during the Great Recession. The extended benefits, which are in addition to the regular benefits, are in 2009 dollars.\nThe authors also looked at what happened when the federal government stepped in and offered to fully fund two initiatives — the Extended Benefits (EB) and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) programs — aimed at extending the number of weeks laid-off workers could receive benefits at a time when the national unemployment rate topped 10 percent.\nNot every state chose to expand benefits to the same degree, and exploiting this variation, the authors found a similar effect: An additional $3,600 in maximum benefits prevented nearly 15 percent of the layoff-related increase in foreclosures.\nIndeed, it had a bigger impact on the housing market than the two major foreclosure-prevention programs targeting the crisis — the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). The authors estimate that extending unemployment insurance prevented two-thirds more foreclosures than both HAMP and HARP combined.\nThe UI benefits also likely prevented larger losses in home values stemming from derelict properties. People who live in a house are more likely to keep up with basic maintenance — yard work, plumbing, cleaning — than homeowners who have walked away. That has spillover effects for the entire neighborhood, stabilizing home values even when the owners have not lost their jobs.\nTo be clear, the Great Recession was extreme in both the jobs lost and the damage wrought on the housing market. So, it’s unlikely that extensions of unemployment insurance would have a similarly large impact during a more modest downturn, Melzer said.\nStill, this research should give policymakers food for thought about the ancillary benefits from unemployment programs.\n“Unemployment Insurance as a Housing Market Stabilizer” appears in the January issue of the American Economic Review.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I helped my coworker develop a GI baker in CUDA that uses PRT for real-time preview/light tweaking, and even with totally unoptimized code it can finish a complex scene in a few minutes on an older consumer-level GPU. It seems a lot of people just no longer want to deal with the complexity of researching, implementing, and maintaining such a system.\nAlso with regards to #6...you can't resolve an MSAA lighting buffer prior to sampling it in the final pass. It will cause artifacts for pixels where 1 or more triangles only cover a fraction of subsamples. During the final pass you also need to avoid sampling subsamples of the lighting pass buffer that don't \"belong\" to the triangle being rasterized, either by running the shader at per-sample frequency or by using SV_Coverage in D3D11.\nMJP: Is just that some people just go with the latest trend, they switch their brain off and not think that every new technique is a tool in your arsenal but it's still up to you to use the right tools in the right places.\nMJP: About #6 I agree that it's not really correct (at all) but I've seen that done and mhm I might be fuzzy on this but I think it does produce something reasonable.\n\"So it's basically 6 32bit buffers versus 5, not such a huge difference.\"\nUmmm... Can you go into detail on how you would lay out your buffers for light prepass?\nAs far as I can tell light prepass requires only one additional buffer - the light accumulation buffer - over forward rendering. Total is light buffer, final/normal buffer, depth buffer = 3 (or 4 if you need more light precision).\nSince the normals/specpower are not needed after the light prepass, they can share the final buffer. Normals can be rendered into the final buffer, light buffer calculated, then normals overwritten in the final pass with the final color.\nAlso, light prepass avoids the annoyances associated with MRTs.\nWrt #4, deferred lighting has to perform another vertex transform pass that happens regardless of Hi-Z, which can be expensive especially if its not a simple ModelViewProj transform.

While the person asking the question is doing so with entirely innocent intent (he wants to find a game that matches what his wife is looking for, and tells us what that is in the details), the title is problematic to quite a few people.\nPersonally, I cringe a little every time I see it. In other parts of the \"gaming\" community, there is a lot of general misogyny and this term is thrown around as one of many derogatory terms implying that women don't play \"real\" games. Having a title like that gives the impression that the question (and by extension the site) is for male RPG players. That isn't actually true of this community from what I've seen at all, but we're facing something of a negative social stigma due to the actions of others and IMO need to avoid lopsided terminology like this.\nFor this specific question it would be easy enough to change the title to something like \"nobles & political intrigue\" rather than \"wife-friendly\" (which would be more accurate). But I'm thinking about a more general case answer for what to do the next time similar terminology appears.", "output": "Yes, terminology like this should be edited away liberally from questions, answers, and especially question titles.\nPeople could be quite reasonably offended by this language - it's making disrespectful stereotypical judgements - and that in itself might well be a good enough reason to edit these terms.\nBut there's another reason as well.\n\"[societal-role]-friendly\" actually communicates nothing, and we can do better\nWe're all aware that people can enjoy any kind of game, regardless of their gender, or their familial status, or even their profession. So, really, the adjective \"wife-friendly\" doesn't mean anything at all, nor does \"male-friendly\" - nor \"dentist-friendly,\" for that matter.\nSo this terminology is useless:\n\nWhere can I find an adventure friendly to [societal role]?\n\nNobody knows what the heck that means. As a title, it's a poor one - this terminology tells people little about the question and it is not search-engine friendly.\nWhat does \"[societal-role]-friendly\" actually mean in your particular case? Does it mean the adventure has [features]? Great! Be to the point, and write this instead:\n\nWhere can I find a game that has [features]?\n\nThis one actually communicates something. As a title, it tells you what the question's about from the questions list or from search engine results - and it's search engine friendly. It's good communication, and a great title. So it should be written like this in the first place - and edited to be like this if it isn't.\nAfter word: Societal role terminology can be quite OK\nThis question and answer is meant to deal with the times it isn't useful and shouldn't be taken as a command to edit away all instances of such terms indiscriminately. Describing people in terms of their societal role is actually useful sometimes.\nConsider these cases:\n\nI suspect my GM is favouring this boy/girl they like\nI'm experiencing social tensions in my group because my husband/wife/etc is also playing\n\nThe societal roles here are very important, as are the specific nature of these relationships. There's not much to be gained by editing these away, and there's not much room for improvement here: these statements are already to the point.\nSo edit away cases where mention of a societal role is useless, but naturally, not indiscriminately when they're useful.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Have you heard about \"A Theory of Justice, the Musical\"?", "output": "John Rawls’ 1971 book A Theory of Justice—with its famous illustration of “the veil of ignorance”—is a rigorous attempt to make egalitarian principles normative in political philosophy. The work remains a high watermark for liberalism and a meaningful challenge to right-libertarians, meaning that it’s generally taken seriously by critics and admirers alike. Well, almost…. One cadre of admirers, the writers and producers of A Theory of Justice, the Musical (trailer above), decided to have a little fun with the very publicity-shy Rawls (who died in 2002), imagining him on a time-traveling adventure where he meets with Plato, Locke, Rousseau, Mill and others to draw inspiration for his magnum opus. Along the way, Rawls must dodge the “evil designs” of his libertarian antagonist Robert Nozick and “his objectivist lover, Ayn Rand” (Rand and Nozick were, to my knowledge, never so involved, but the idea is amusing).\nThe farcical production promises “a musical score that covers everything from rap battles to power ballads.” I would imagine that the appeal of Rawls, The Musical might be rather limited to a special subset of people who get the bookish references and love musical theater. But maybe that group is larger than I think. Since the January 30th premier in Oxford this year, A Theory of Justice, the Musical—praised by philosopher Nigel Warburton as “brilliant: hilarious witty and profound”—received several five star reviews and the initial theater run sold out a week before opening. But of course, that was Oxford, not New York. The show’s producers do plan to take the show on the road—to London, Scotland, and the U.S. (and they are actively fundraising; a complete viewing of an Oxford performance will cost you $9.99, and other groups wishing to perform the show must purchase a license).\nThe widespread appeal of Rawls is understandable given that he best articulates the idea of equality as an inherently ethical value in political life. His is a position that revises so much classical political theory and informs or infuriates so many current political combatants. While opponents of distributive justice will no doubt find reasons to disagree with Rawls on principle, careful critical thinkers will at least consider the arguments before making objections. But if you don’t have time to read all five-hundred plus pages of Rawls’ masterwork, you could certainly do worse than watch Harvard’s Michael Sandel explain Rawls’ theories in his lecture above (featuring some smart student critics of Rawls). The lecture is eighth in a course called “Justice: What’s the Right Thing To Do,” which was released by edX as a MOOC this past March.\nGreat lecture.

{"input": "What can you tell me about Don Quixote?", "output": "For Milan Kundera, the modern era – “and with it the novel”, he adds – is born when Don Quixote rides forth on his nobbly nag Rocinante. “The Adventures of Don Quixote” by Miguel de Cervantes was published in two parts, the first in 1605. By the time the second appeared a decade later, the title’s fame had already spread around Europe and into Spain’s colonies in the Americas. It has since become one of the most influential works in the entire canon of literature. Along with Homer’s “Iliad”, Dante’s “Divine Comedy” and Milton’s “Paradise Lost”, “Don Quixote” is a book that begat multitudes.\nAnd yet unlike all those other masterpieces, its canvas does not usher genuflecting readers into the orbit of lofty gods, or of God himself, or into the presence of the great heroes and heroines. Rather it tells of a simple man who has read too many chivalric romances, inspired by which he prances out on a quest to perform deeds in the heroic style of bygone knights.\nThis was why Kundera anointed it the first novel. Here for the first time is a whole epic about ordinary human clay, bathetically stripped of all but the most ragged medieval armour. Romance is dead. The protagonist is left to his own devices, his only company the stolid squire Sancho Panza. Together they form obverse halves of the human psyche. Where Quixote is a fantasist who barely feels the deforming blows of his many assailants, Sancho is a dull-witted, earthbound pragmatist. The book is a rambling chronicle of their uproarious misadventures, in which wayward farce eventually makes way for the pathos and redemption of self-knowledge.\nCervantes had made a lifelong study of the folly of heroism. A Spanish marine, he was hospitalised for six months following the Battle of Lepanto, then captured by Barbary pirates and imprisoned in Algiers for five years, where after four failed attempts at escape he was ransomed by his parents. Later he became a tax collector. His writing career was an indifferent tour of tired literary fashions until, past 50, he dispatched his knight into the arid plain of La Mancha to have his romantic illusions slowly peeled away. And all the while Cervantes supplied a running commentary, which is the book’s other priceless invention: the metatextual ironist who discloses the machinery of narrative.\nThis 900-page brick is not easy reading. But all novelists, whether they like it or not, are creatures of Cervantes, who turned himself into a character in his own fiction four centuries before John Self, the anti-hero of Martin Amis’s “Money”, ran into a shady figure calling himself Martin Amis. “That Cervantes has been a great friend of mine for many years,” boasted Don Quixote of his creator. “His book has some clever ideas; but it sets out to do something and concludes nothing.” The English picaresque novel’s earliest practitioners are unthinkable without him: Fielding, Smollett, Sterne. The story has been repurposed by Chesterton, Kafka, Greene, Borges, Rushdie and so on and on.\nThis year is all about Shakespeare, who died on 23 April 1616. Smudge out the discrepancy between the Julian and Gregorian calendars and he shares a death day with Cervantes. So, as is right and proper, the Royal Shakespeare Company has found room in the celebrations to stage the doorstopper in a new adaptation by James Fenton. David Threlfall makes his first return to the RSC in the 30 years since he played Smike in the globe-trotting hit “Nicholas Nickleby”. As Sancho Panza there’s Rufus Hound, who made his name playing low-life chancers in “One Man, Two Guvnors” and “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”.\nQuite apart from the novelists, Cervantes, with his self-referencing feints, inspired other art forms to enter into a dialogue with him from the start. “Cardenio”, thought to be a lost play by Shakespeare, was based on a fable from “Don Quixote”. The book has since been made into operas by Telemann, Mendelssohn and Massenet, a sprightly, yearning tone poem by Strauss, and a long-running Broadway musical called “Man of La Mancha”, later filmed with Peter O’Toole. The National Theatre in London staged the book in 1982 with Paul Scofield astride a penny farthing. And then there are the ballets choreographed by Balanchine and Petipa. Alexei Fadeyechev’s latest version of Petipa’s “Don Quixote” for the Bolshoi is currently marking the anniversary in Moscow and will be seen outside Russia later this year. Meanwhile Cervantes’s rackety life is entertainingly toured in William Egginton’s new biographical study, “The Man Who Invented Fiction: How Cervantes Ushered in the Modern World”.\nDon Quixote’s name can sometimes occlude his indispensable companion. As the Stranglers once asked, “Whatever happened to…Sancho Panza?” Well, he has tagged along in this eternal afterlife too. In 2002 he was going to be reincarnated as Johnny Depp in Terry Gilliam’s film version. Depp was to play an ad exec who writes a commercial featuring Quixote, only to find himself transplanted back to the 17th century and mistaken by Quixote for his squire.\nGilliam’s quixotic quest to film “Don Quixote” is fast becoming the most famous unshot movie in cinematic history. His 2002 production was undone by a flash flood which irretrievably altered the parched location, while his knight errant Jean Rochefort was invalided out with a doubled herniated disc. Last year Gilliam was all set to saddle up again, only for John Hurt to get pancreatic cancer. There are fresh rumours of a recommencement. Gilliam can take courage from Quixote’s eternal optimism. As he says after being beaten up for the umpteenth time, “Fortune always leaves one door open in disasters to admit a remedy”.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Story: Rochester was glad it was his turn to walk the dog. He generally didn't like to do this chore when company was over, but since Malcolm, the school bully, was one of those visitors he welcomed the chance to get away. Malcolm and his mother, Dr. Von Beddinglam, were over that night to meet Colonel Greenerbaum. Colonel Greenerbaum was a client of Rochester's father. Rochester's mother thought the single Dr. Von Beddinglam and the single Colonel Greenerbaum would want to meet. It turned out to be a bad idea as Colonel Greenerbaum was not nearly as nice as Rochester's parents thought. Rochester's mother reminded Rochester to be very careful while walking the dog, after all Rochester was still in the 6th grade. Rochester assured his mother he would and then zipped up his jacket and grabbed Fido's leash. \"It was nice meeting you Colonel Greenerbaum,\" said Rochester. \"Is it still raining outside?\" grumbled the colonel. \"It was raining cats and dogs early today, made my Cayman S Porsche all muddy.\" \"I shall see,\" responded Rochester. There wasn't any rain outside but there was the neighbor's cat on the front porch. After a couple of barks and a loud hiss, the dog began to chase the cat and both pets quickly disappeared into the night. \"Oh dear,\" said Rochester. Rochester's parents moaned. This has happened several times before and every time they would tell Rochester to put the leash on Fido before opening the door. Fortunately, Fido always grew tired of chasing the cat after a few blocks and returned home on his own. \"Well, it looks like it hasn't rained in quite a while, colonel,\" said Rochester. The colonel muttered something inaudibly and then left the house without even thanking Rochester's parents for their hospitality. \"How about some lights?\" growled Colonel Greenerbaum as he walked in the dark towards his Porsche. Before anyone could reply, Colonel Greenerbaum took another step and turned on the motion-sensor light above the garage just as he reached his car. \"Thank you for a lovely evening,\" said Dr. Von Beddinglam. She was always polite and always very gracious. \"Let's go Malcolm!\" Malcolm stumbled into the foyer carrying his electric guitar in his right hand. He didn't have a case for his guitar because the police were holding it as evidence. Rochester hated that guitar. For one, Malcolm used Rochester's face as a pick for a 45-minute rendition of \"Smoke on the Water\" and two: it was a left-handed guitar. \"Thank you for a lovely evening,\" said Malcolm pretending to be sincere. Before Rochester's mother could praise Malcolm for his manners, the colonel yelled: \"someone scratched my car!\" Everyone ran outside and saw that there was a foot long scratch on the driver's side door of Colonel Greenerbaum's brand new Porsche. The scratch ran parallel to the car and was as straight as a ruler. The colonel had backed his car up the driveway, meaning the driver's side was directly next to the driver side of Dr. Von Beddinglams car. The front of her car faced up at the house, while Colonel Greenerbaum's Porsche faced down the steeply sloped driveway towards the street. \"This is your fault,\" shouted Colonel Greenerbaum to Rochester's father. \"I'm going to make you pay! This scratch will cost $759.89 to fix!\" Rochester's father asked Colonel Greenerbaum if maybe the scratch had occurred somewhere else but the colonel insisted the damaged had been done while parked in his driveway. \"I love my Cayman S Porsche and its 295 horsepower. I know what every inch of my car looks like at all times!\" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed a flashlight from his glove box and used it to give Rochester's father a better look at the scratch. \"Look how long it is,\" exclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. The colonel licked his thumb and rubbed some mud away from the scratch to reveal that it was two inches longer than previously estimated. \"What do you think?\" asked Rochester's mother. \"It looks like a new scratch but I don't know. How can we be sure it happened here?\" wondered Rochester's father. Just then, Fido returned home with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. Rochester quickly attached the leashed to his collar and gave him a little scratch behind the ears. \"Your dog is suspect number one. Look at his collar. It's the same height as the scratch. He could have done it when he chased the cat. I told you it's your fault.\" Rochester's father agreed that Fido could have scratched the Porsche but he still wasn't convinced. \"You're daughter Roxie rode her bike home. Her bike could have done it and that makes her suspect number two.\" Roxie had returned from the library shortly after Colonel Greenerbaum arrived. Dinner was delayed while everyone waited for her to change her clothes. During Roxie's ride home, her bicycle's back tire splashed mud all over her. \"She coasted her bike between the two cars and scratched the car with her pedal.\" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed Roxie's bike; it was leaning up against the garage door. The colonel positioned the bike so it faced in the same direction Roxie would have been travelling when she came up the driveway. He then positioned the pedal on Roxie's bike at the same height as the scratch on his Porsche. Next the colonel moved the bike forward, but didn't move the pedal, to show how Roxie's bike could have scratched his Porsche while coasting home. \"It's possible,\" admitted Rochester's father. \"I'll go and ask my daughter if she scratched your car.\" Rochester's mother buried her head in her hand. Her daughter would never purposely damage someone's property, but she is so easily distracted that she could have very well scratched the Porsche without even realizing it. \"Why? She'll just lie or you'll lie to protect her. Besides, if it wasn't her then it was the boy and his guitar.\" The colonel claimed to have seen the guitar when he got out of his Porsche and Malcolm's mother admitted it was kept in the back seat on the driver's side. All agreed that the scratch on the Porsche could have been caused by some of the metal parts on Malcolm's guitar. \"Dr. Von Beddinglam told us before dinner that Malcolm was caught once vandalizing a car. He's a juvenile delinquent. I know he scratched my Porsche with his guitar and since it happened on your property you'll have to pay,\" said the colonel. \"But when did Malcolm scratch your car?\" asked Rochester's father. \"When you were in the kitchen doing the dishes. His mother gave him the keys to her vehicle so he could go and fetch his guitar. Here's how he did it.\"\nThe colonel ripped the guitar out of Malcolm's right hand and then demonstrated how he scratched the car while walking back to the house. According to the colonel, Malcolm would have walked back to the house with the Porsche on his left side while holding the neck of the guitar in his left hand. Rochester's father admitted it was very plausible especially the way the cars were parked. Dr. Von Beddinglam asked her son if he had scratched the car and of course he said he didn't. \"It doesn't matter what he says. The kid is a hoodlum,\" proclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. I gave you three suspects.\" \"You forgot to include yourself,\" remarked Rochester. The colonel glared at Rochester. \"Colonel, one of the suspects can't speak. The other probably doesn't even remember and the third is a known lair. How are we supposed to know what really happened?\" asked Rochester's father. \"I told you there are only three possible ways it could have happened.\" \"You forgot to include the possibility that the car was already scratched,\" remarked Rochester. Again the colonel glared at Rochester. \"Regardless of what your son thinks, or which of the three ways it happened, you are responsible. I demand you pay to have the scratch fixed or I'll take my business elsewhere.\" Colonel Greenerbaum was Rochester's father’s top client. If he lost the colonel's business he could possibly lose his entire business. \"I'm sorry about your car, Colonel. I will pay to have it fixed.\" Rochester's father was dejected but he saw no other around the mystery of the scratched Porsche and no other way to keep the colonel's business. Suddenly, the motion sensor light turned itself off after its long programmable delay period had expired. In another coincidence, the neighbor's cat returned. Fido saw the feline and tried to chase it but all he did was jerked the leash taunt and turn the motion sensor light back on. \"Father,\" said Rochester, \"I know who is responsible for the scratch on the colonel's Porsche.\" Who is responsible for the scratch on the Porsche?", "output": "“The car was already scratched when Colonel Greenerbaum got here. First, it could not have been Roxie with her bicycle. Because of how steep the driveway is, you have to pedal to get up it. That means it would not have created a level scratch. It could not have been Malcolm. Malcolm was left handed and carried the guitar in his right hand, but when he walked from his mother's car to the house the Porsche would have been on his left side. The Colonel was wrong in his demonstration. Since Fido did not trigger the motion sensor light when he chased the cat, he must not have been near the car. Since he was not near the car, he could not have scratched the car. That is why the other three could not have done it.”\n\n“The Colonel knew it was scratched because he knew the exact cost to repair it. Not only that, but there was mud on the scratch. If the scratch had been made after the mud, the mud would not have been covering the scratch.”", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain why the Kansas law is wrong according to the First Amendment.", "output": "Esther is a veteran math teacher and trainer who was told she would need to sign the certification statement in order to participate in a state program training other math teachers. She boycotts consumer goods and services produced by Israeli companies and international companies operating in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. She does so in order to protest the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians and to pressure the government to change its policies. As a result, she could not in good conscience sign the statement and thus couldn't participate in the state program.\nThe Kansas Law’s legislative history reveals that its goal is to undermine the message of those participating in a boycott of Israel. This is either viewpoint discrimination against the opinion that Israel mistreats Palestinians or subject matter discrimination on the topic of Israel. Both are impermissible goals under the First Amendment.\nThe Israelis have been oppressing the Palestinians since the 1940's. Why, all of a sudden, is this big issue?\nBecause in recent years the International collusion network of zionists have been working in overdrive in order to shut everyone up so they do not reveal the unspeakable abuse that they inflict upon everyone that they deal with; the biggest sufferers of all being the Palestinians.\nThe reason they work in overdrive is that people are \"talking\" more and more about that issue due to the proliferation of the internet and social media platforms, which makes hiding things from the world very difficult.\nIn recent years, the zionists have succeeded so much in influencing US lawmakers, that Americans have effectively lost their liberty to speak the truth without reprisals and has thereby technically become a vassal state of Israel, despite the vast difference in size and the ridiculousness of it all, so it is no longer a question of Israel/Palestine, but a question of US/Israel and a question of US sovereignty and liberty.\nYou're not seeing the forest for the trees. The issue here is not the Arab-Israeli confict per se, but rather whether the State has the right to require political litmus tests of contrators and employees in general.\nHilarious. It's good it failed. It'll go up to SC. Then Dershowitz & a massive legal team come in & point out that BDS very similar to Nazi era \"Don't buy from Jews\", it is, and bye bye BDS. It will also change boycotts in USA FOREVER. Ya gotta remember, Israel is a JEWISH STATE that has over 1.5 MILLION Muslim citizens. So you see, BDS is just another form of Nazi as are most of the people that support it. Canary Mission exposes more and more every single day.\n1) Because, until recently, things had been improving (albeit slowly and fitfully). Recently, though, the rate at which Israeli settlements have been built in Palestinian territory, followed promptly by annexation of that territory, has been increasing.\n2) In the last 15 or so years, the \"it's the end of the world, we need to support Israel so they can build the Third Temple\" faction of Evangelicals has done a lot of organizing and gained a *lot* of political influence. They've found unlikely allies (and funding) in the defense contractors who sell arms to Israel with the money we supply.\n3) Stupid laws like the one in Kentucky are a new tactic by these same Evangelicals, for whom it's a win-win. If they get to enforce it, they support Israel in some odd way (because there's *so much* Israeli product in the US for most people to boycott). If it gets struck down, they get to tell their base how much of an anti-godly liberal bias there is in the courts today.\nThis is so obviously an illegal law. I can't understand why it even needs this much scrutiny. Throw out this obviously illegal law, Kansas (and Arizona).\nEquating to to Nazi policies is patently ridiculous. Nazis were ordering people to boycott. This is the opposite. Kansas is telling people from whom they must buy. What's next? Can Iowa tell us we can't boycott Saudi Arabia?\nYes the Kansas law is nothing but blackmail, at the very least it is coercion .\nCan any zionist apologist explain why it is legal for evangelicals to boycott an American company such as Disney, but illegal to boycott a foreign government?Well, some foreign governments. You can still boycott North Korea or Iran. I guess,because Jesus.\nFight for free speech- support the ACLU.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "The Trial Process of Those Accused of Plotting the 9/11 Attack and Associated Issues", "output": "Fourteen years after the 9/11 attacks that killed almost 3,000 people, the five accused of the war crimes — including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed — have yet to enter pleas.\nThe pretrial hearings for Mohammed and four others — Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa al-Hawsawi — restarted last week after an 18-month delay. But the trials might not begin until 2020, and some say they may begin even later.\nIt has been a long, drawn-out process, and proceedings quickly hit yet another snag, as one client asked about the possibility of representing himself and prompted the detailing of a long list of complaints about the process the U.S. is using to try those accused of plotting the attacks.\n“I would like to know what are the procedures for self-representation?” bin Attash asked. He said he does not trust the commission or his lawyers, including Cheryl Bormann.\nShe then cited some of the reasons her client lacked confidence in his defense and the court. The list of grievances was long.\nDuring the trial, there was a set of microphones at the defense tables in the courtroom, feeding audio to a government agency, assumed to be the CIA.\nBin Attash said he does not know if there is an FBI agent on his defense team, which was the case with bin al-Shibh, or if there is a CIA operative on his team. “Because in this bizarre setting, that actually has occurred,” Bormann said. Bin al-Shibh previously identified a courtroom interpreter as someone he encountered while at a CIA black site.\nOther oddities include the discovery of obscured microphones in rooms used by defense lawyers and the fact that thousands of defense counsel emails were given to the prosecution.\nNow the bid for self-representation has triggered even more issues.\nArmy Col. James Pohl, the presiding judge, has to decide two things: how self-representation would work and if the accused waived his right to counsel knowingly and voluntarily, making an informed choice to represent himself.\nBut essentially nothing Bin Attash does is voluntary, given the nature of his imprisonment at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, where he is held incommunicado in Camp 7, a unit for high-value detainees. That level of secrecy causes all sorts of legal problems. “I can't possibly advise Mr. bin Attash of his rights because I frankly don't know what they are,” Bormann said.\nThat amendment deals with rights to make criminal prosecutions fairer and more legitimate. For example, in Guantánamo the accused may not see the classified evidence against him, let alone file motions, use a law library or talk to witnesses.\n“So many questions arise when you try to invent justice as you go along,” wrote Dror Ladin, an ACLU staff attorney who attended last week’s hearings, in a post on the organization’s website.\nHe added that the biggest obstacle is government secrecy — a problem that is not confined to the accused. “Even security-cleared defense counsel at Guantánamo are sometimes kept in the dark about relevant evidence,” he wrote.\nJudges too are not immune from that problem. Last week an attorney for Baluchi, Jay Connell, disclosed a secret Pentagon program, the Alternative Compensatory Control Measure, which the judge appeared clueless about, as reported first by The Miami Herald. The document revealed “the existence of the program as a mysterious, complicating factor in self-representation,” the newspaper reported.\nThe Pentagon could not comment on the program beyond what was discussed in the court session, a Pentagon spokesman told Al Jazeera via email.\nSeparately, Connell is still waiting to hear if the prosecution must produce information about where his client was held. Also, of the more than 6 million pages of CIA documents about torture, the defense has seen fewer than 300.\nAnd then there is the torture. “The defendants … face the unique challenge of representing themselves when they have been tortured by the government that seeks to kill them,” as Ladin bluntly put it, writing from Guantánamo.\nThe defendants have said that their torture is continuing and the conditions at Camp 7 are “aggravating the torture they endured at the black sites,” Ladin said.\nAccording to unofficial transcripts of court proceedings, three days of hearings last week lasted some 189 minutes. That week at the court cost a whopping $1,436,400, on the basis of a previous estimate that the court costs $7,600 a minute. The hearings resumed Sunday and are expected to conclude on Oct. 30.\nPrevious Guantánamo military convictions — there have been eight — also had their problems. Half have been vacated in part or full, essentially because the crimes they were tried for were not war crimes, so the military commission did not have jurisdiction over them. An appeal is pending in the case of Omar Khadr. Two men who pleaded guilty are awaiting sentencing, including Majid Khan who was raped and waterboarded.\nKhan’s hearing has been canceled, and the trial schedule for sentencing has been held in suspense, said his lawyer Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. So the military court will be dark in November.\n“Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback. Cases lingered on,” President Barack Obama said — back in 2009.\nNearly all observers would agree that not much has changed since then.\nUpdate: Since this story was published, the military commission on Monday \"resolved a longstanding issue regarding an alleged conflict of interest in the defense team for Ramzi Bin Al Shibh, ruling that there was no actual or potential conflict,\" according to Cmdr.

Alan Mannus is a Toronto born keeper putting his talents to work for Scottish Premiership side St. Johnstone. While born in Canada, Mannus has represented Northern Ireland at various levels and is a regular member of the senior team. We spoke with him via email about what factors resulted in him playing for Northern Ireland, Euro 2016 and how Canada fits into his life.\nSSPC: To start with the most obvious question. Why did you choice to play for Northern Ireland rather than Canada?\nAM: It was never a choice of one over the other, as I never had an opportunity to play for Canada at any level, whereas I had opportunities with Northern Ireland from Under 14 level onwards.\nSSPC: While many Canadian fans are aware that you were born in Toronto, not too much is known about you between your birth and joining Linfield’s youth ranks. Would you care to shed a little light on your youth and what is your connection like to Canada today?\nAM: My brothers and I were born in Toronto and lived in Mississauga. When i was about 7 my family moved to Northern Ireland, which is where my parents are from. I played for St. Andrews and then Lisburn Youth, and then after that I joined Linfield when I was 16. My ol der brother, Paul, moved back to Canada about 4 years ago. He lives in Kitchener near Toronto, and I, along with my other brothers Ian and Toby, have been out to visit him every summer since he moved.\nSSPC: In the past you’ve said you never take your place on a team for granted. Despite being a regular squad member, has the Northern Ireland Euro qualification added a greater deal of pressure to perform strong this season than in past seasons?\nAM: I have been involved in many squads over the last 10 years with Northern Ireland and I, like the other players, want to go to the Euros this summer. But I know it’s not guaranteed. You need to be playing regularly with your club and avoid injuries. Anyone can lose their place or get injured so that’s why I don’t take it for granted. I know that any game can be my last. I haven’t really looked as far ahead as the Euros as anything can happen (good or bad) from now until then.\nSSPC: You made the jump from the League of Ireland, which you’ve called a “part time” league, to the Scottish Premiership in 2011. Was it a difficult move to adjust to?\nAM: Although we were on part time contracts, there was still a full time mentality. The training was somewhere between part and full time. I don’t think it was difficult to adjust to the move, but it was a bit of a step up to the Scottish Premiership.\nSSPC: You mentioned earlier having never gotten the chance to play for Canada. Did the CSA or then Canadian coach Frank Yallop ever make contact?\nAM: No, I have never been contacted about it. When you contacted me for this interview I was surprised that you knew about me.\nSSPC: Canadian fans often express a lot of “what ifs” in regards to players who are eligible to play for Canada but end up with another nation. Do you ever get “what if feelings”?\nAM: Not really, you cant change the past. My life and football career couldn’t have been better so I wouldn’t change anything.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "A real-world puzzler - find the pattern!\n\nThis is a bit of an unusual puzzle - one that is purely \"real world\" :)\nMy console can produce a load of colours. But I can't find any obvious way to relate the colour to its number. \nI'd hoped that some bits would map to some of RGB, but if they do, I can't see how. Obviously red-like colours are at 001, 009, 052, 088. Obviously green-like colours are at 002, 010, 022-024, 028-037. It looks almost arbitrary. \nBut there are hints of pattern. There seem to be repeated \"fade to lighter colours\" for yellow-white, that usually - but not always - contain 6 items  (118-123, 148-151, 154-159, 178-181, 190-195, 220-225, 226-231),  repeated changes of shading for red-magenta that also usually contain 6 items, this time always 36 apart (016-021, 052-057, 088-093, 124-129, 160-165, 196-201), and a long greyscale sequence (232-255). \nThere's got to be a systematic pattern... hasn't there? Surely someone didn't arbitrarily think \"Which 255 colours shall we have\" and number them 0-255 as they came to mind?  But apart from the repeated-but-not-always 6-ness of it, I'm stumped. What could it be?\n\nAnd again, arranged in 6's.

Actually, in the image here it looks as if 8-15 may be the same as 0-7; I think maybe they used to mean \"flashing\" or something?\nNow extend from 4 bits to 8 bits (i.e., using twice as much storage to describe a given number of characters). This takes you from 16 to 256 colours, leaving another 240 to add. So, write that as 216+24; use the first 216 to go through a 6x6x6 cube of colours, and then the final 24 for a range of greys. For no obvious reason, in traversing the cube B varies fastest, then G, then R, which is the opposite ordering from those first 8 colours (which are a 2x2x2 cube).\n\nHere's a bit of crappy Javascript and the result of putting it into a web page:\nfunction c(n) {\n  var r,g,b;\n  if (n < 16) {\n    r = (n&1) ? 255 : 64; // ELMY: 85 not 64\n    g = (n&2) ? 255 : 64; // ELMY: 85 not 64\n    b = (n&4) ? 255 : 64; // ELMY: 85 not 64\n  }\n  else if (n < 16+216) {\n    var m = n-16;\n    r = Math.floor(m/36); m -= 36*r;\n    g = Math.floor(m/ 6); m -=  6*g;\n    b = m;\n    r = 32*(r+3)-1; // ELMY: 40*r + 55*(r>0)\n    g = 32*(g+3)-1; // ELMY: 40*g + 55*(g>0)\n    b = 32*(b+3)-1; // ELMY: 40*b + 55*(b>0)\n  }\n  else {\n    var m = n-(16+216);\n    r = 10*(m+1); // ELMY: 10*m+8\n    g = r; b = r;\n  }\n  r = r.toString(16); if (r.length==1) r = \"0\"+r;\n  g = g.toString(16); if (g.length==1) g = \"0\"+g;\n  b = b.toString(16); if (b.length==1) b = \"0\"+b;\n  return \"#\" + r + g + b;\n}\n\nI made some rather arbitrary choices in the above and the match with the image in the OP isn't perfect, but it's pretty good.\n[EDITED to add:] Elmy's answer (which presents code basically equivalent to mine above) has what he says -- and I see no reason to disbelieve it -- are the correct values for some parameters in the code above to reproduce the OP's colours exactly.

{"input": "How can socialists tackle the challenge of climate change in a time of neoliberalism? Respond in 33 sentences.", "output": "Climate change can seem ill-suited to mass politics. It’s complicated and hard to understand. Its causes are so embedded in everyday life that it can be hard to see until disaster strikes. It encompasses the entire planet: decisions made on one side of the world wreak havoc with people’s lives on the other. Meanwhile the rich and powerful corporations and people responsible for the problem run the institutions tasked with solving it.\nIn fact, it sounds a lot like capitalism.\nBut for as long as climate change has been on the political agenda, neoliberalism has been ascendant. Which means the discussion among elites today is filled with pseudo-solutions to the problem: guilt-laden appeals to individuals to take personal responsibility for their consumption; green technologies developed with public funds by private companies that hold the patents; market mechanisms designed by the industries they ought to be demolishing; executive orders that propose to keep the tides at bay without causing too much of a fuss. Meanwhile, austerity measures are starving public goods and services just when we should be expanding them and resurgent nationalist movements are closing borders as we should be reaching across them.\nThose who have the least to lose from global warming are leading us down a road to disaster that will hit black and brown, poor and working-class people first and hardest — both the literal disasters that will strike more sharply and frequently, and the social catastrophes that will follow if right-wing movements are able to successfully turn understandable fear into xenophobic reaction while the wealthy retreat to their luxury bunkers.\nBut the silver lining of the gathering storm clouds is that after years of liberal vacillation dominating the climate discussion, the tide is starting to turn left. Whether it can outpace the rising seas is another question.\nIf capitalism is driving climate change, does that mean we need a revolution to stop it?\nWe should hope not. The Left’s vision of radical transformation can seem like an obvious match for the climate challenge. But the Left remains historically weak and a return to real power on the scale required isn’t likely anytime soon — certainly not on the timescale we need to start taking serious action. We can’t shortcut the long-term project of building socialism — but nor can we sideline climate action along the way. Otherwise, even in the best-case scenario, the Left will win power only to manage a state of increasing climate breakdown.\nSo no matter how necessary a break with capitalism is, for now we’ll have to settle for addressing climate change as best we can within it. That means pushing hard to decarbonize as rapidly as possible in ways that set the stage for a sustainable socialist society.\nWe’ll only be able to do that if our movements have a strong anticapitalist core. Fortunately, climate movements have been steadily moving left, foregrounding climate justice and building alliances with communities on the front lines of both fossil fuel extraction and climate impacts. Indigenous movements have led the way in waging battles in places like Standing Rock that have called global attention to the rapaciousness of fossil fuel companies and articulated connections between the wellbeing of human communities and the ecosystems they depend on. Socialists must join these struggles fighting the inequalities that prefigure eco-apartheid while continuing to build a mass movement fighting to lay the foundations we’ll need to go beyond fossil capitalism.\nClimate change more than any other issue demonstrates the need for socialism. It points to the need for more democratic political control over industry, technology, and infrastructure; more conscious intention about how we build our world, why, and for whom.\nEmbracing conscious planning of wide sectors of the economy and the power of technology is part of a decidedly “Old Left” vision — but the old hubris about “mastering nature” isn’t. Our socialism is about creating a sustainable politics of joy and abundance for the many. Give us bread and roses — and parks and oceans.\nOf course, even those classic demands get more complicated when drought threatens wheat crops and flower gardens, as forests burn and oceans acidify. Climate change must be a spur to the Left to think creatively, organize expansively, and act quickly.\nThis is an edition about climate change, but climate change isn’t just an issue to talk about every few years — it has to be at the center of how we mobilize and organize going forward.

Two Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving stolen goods on a small tanker named Prime South (IMO: 9452804), the documents showed.\nShell confirmed on Tuesday that eight of the 11 men charged were current or former employees at Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd.\nTuesday’s cases could be just the first insight into a grander scheme.\nThe Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving gasoil in the early evening hours of Jan. 7, at wharf 5 at the heart of Shell’s operations on Bukom island, the documents show.\nDuring raids on Sunday, police said they seized S$3.05 million in cash and the 12,000-deadweight-tonne tanker. They have also frozen suspects’ bank accounts.\nShell said on Tuesday it anticipated “a short delay” in its supply operations at Bukom, its largest wholly owned refinery in the world in terms of crude distillation capacity. It declined to say the total amount of oil stolen.\nIt is the second high-profile case of wrongdoing at companies in Singapore to hit headlines in recent weeks, after Keppel Corporation Ltd’s rig-building business agreed in December to pay more than $422 million to resolve charges it bribed Brazilian officials.\nSingapore is one of the world’s most important oil trading hubs, with much of the Middle East’s crude oil passing through Singapore before being delivered to the huge consumers in China, Japan and South Korea.\nSingapore is also Southeast Asia’s main refinery hub and the world’s biggest marine refueling stop.\nThere has been a modest decline since then, although the organization said in a quarterly report that oil theft was still “of concern,” especially in the South China Sea, off the east coast of Malaysia.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

International flights and service on subsidiary US Airways were not affected. \n  \n Some 525 flights on American Airlines were delayed and five canceled on Thursday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. \n  \n The flight groundings follow several high-profile computer problems that U.S. airlines have faced in recent months. Industry consultants say the impact of computer disruptions will keep growing as airlines automate an increasing chunk of operations, outfit their planes with Wifi and distribute boarding passes on smartphones. \n  \n In April, American Airlines delayed flights when an iPad application used by pilots to view airport maps malfunctioned. \n  \n Rival United Airlines (UAL.N) in June halted flights when it discovered a problem arising from its dispatch software. And in July a router error locked United out of its reservations records and therefore blocked check-in and boarding. \n  \n American's stock was up 2.7 percent at $44.22 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. \n  \n (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Andrew Hay and Marguerita Choy) ||||| DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines says it has fixed a technology problem that was grounding flights to and from Dallas, Chicago and Miami on Thursday. \n  \n American spokesman Casey Norton said the airline did not immediately know the cause of the outage, which began around 11 a.m. CDT and lasted nearly two hours. \n  \n Flights on both American and its regional affiliate, American Eagle, were halted. \n  \n The Federal Aviation Administration said that American Airlines planes destined for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, O'Hare Airport in Chicago and Miami International Airport were held on the ground during the outage. \n  \n American did not immediately say how many flights were affected. \n  \n The outage comes at an awkward time for American Airline Group Inc., the world's biggest airline. In a month, the company plans to complete combining the reservations systems of American and its US Airways subsidiary and retiring the US Airways brand. \n  \n Combining technology systems is a difficult feat that has tripped up other airlines, notably leading to several outages at United Airlines after it merged with Continental Airlines in 2010. United suffered two major outages this summer. \n  \n American has made meticulous plans to avoid a similar fate. Among other moves, it will reduce flights to lighten the load on its network while it combines the two reservations systems. ||||| American Airlines resumed flights Thursday after computer problems briefly grounded flights at three of its busiest airports. \n  \n The problem affected flights to and from Chicago's O'Hare Airport, as well as Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. Almost 300 flights were delayed due to the problem, which represents nearly 20% of the daily departures for the world's largest airline. \n  \n The ground stop started around 12:41 p.m. ET, according to the FAA. American said in a statement at 2:42 p.m. that its \"connectivity issues\" had been resolved. \n  \n \"We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to get our customers on their way as soon as possible,\" an American (AAL) spokesman told CNN. \n  \n American said it has no reason to believe that this is related to hacking. However, its IT team is still trying to figure out a definitive cause. \n  \n Problems with computer systems grounding flights are not uncommon. \n  \n United Airlines (UAL) suffered a grounding in March that lasted less than an hour. \n  \n But these kinds of technical problems have a way of rippling through an airline's schedule, causing problems that can take hours or even days to resolve fully, particularly when it hits three major hubs like O'Hare, DFW and Miami. \n  \n Airline schedules are very tight, which makes restoring normal operations and rebooking affected passenger costly and time consuming, said James Record, a professor of aviation at Dowling College, at the time of the United glitch. \n  \n Even flights that were able to land as planned at affected airports can be delayed if there isn't a gate available to unload passengers. That can cause many passengers to miss connections. \n  \n American had to ground about 75 flights over two days this past April due to problems with an iPad app used by pilots. American pilots now get their flight plans and other technical information over company-issued Apple (AAPL, Tech30) iPads. |||||\"", "output": "Just a few days ago, American Airlines confessed it had mistakenly allowed an aircraft not certified for long flights over water to make the trip from LA to Hawaii.

{"input": "Respond in 20 sentences. What would be the economic cost of not meeting climate change goals?", "output": "Achieving the toughest climate change target set in the global Paris agreement will save the world about $30tn in damages, far more than the costs of cutting carbon emissions, according to a new economic analysis.\nMost nations, representing 90% of global population, would benefit economically from keeping global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the research indicates. This includes almost all the world’s poorest countries, as well as the three biggest economies – the US, China and Japan – contradicting the claim of US president, Donald Trump, that climate action is too costly.\nAustralia and South Africa would also benefit, with the biggest winners being Middle East nations, which are threatened with extreme heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival.\nHowever, some cold countries – particularly Russia, Canada and Scandinavian nations – are likely to have their growth restricted if the 1.5C target is met, the study suggests. This is because a small amount of additional warming to 2C would be beneficial to their economies. The UK and Ireland could also see some restriction, though the estimates span a wide range of outcomes.\nThe research, published the journal Nature, is among the first to assess the economic impact of meeting the Paris climate goals. Data from the last 50 years shows clearly that when temperatures rise, GDP and other economic measures fall in most nations, due to impacts on factors including labour productivity, agricultural output and health.\nThe scientists used this relationship and 40 global climate models to estimate the future economic impact of meeting the 1.5C target - a tough goal given the world has already experienced 1C of man-made warming. They also assessed the long-standing 2C target and the impact of 3C of warming, which is the level expected unless current plans for action are increased.\n“We also calculated what’s going to be the additional economic cost if we hit 3C instead of 2C. This will cost the globe an additional 5-10% of GDP, relative to 2C; that is tens of trillions of dollars. These are very large numbers,” he said.\nThe researchers acknowledge there are significant uncertainties in their economic modelling, but said they are confident that keeping climate change to 1.5C is very likely to benefit the vast majority of the world’s people.\nThe exact size of the benefit will depend, for example, on whether new technologies are created that help societies adapt to global warming, such as clean, cheap air conditioning, or whether climate tipping points are passed, bringing more severe damage such as rapid sea level rise. “The caveats apply to both the impacts and the adaptation,” said Prof Noah Diffenbaugh, also at Stanford University.\nThe economic analysis did not include the impacts of climate change on areas that are harder to quantify, such as the natural ecosystems that are vital for clean air and water and fertile soils, or the health benefits of burning less fossil fuel. Including these would make the benefits of action even greater.\n“I think the authors of this study are doing the best job possible, by basing their estimates on a rigorous analysis and clearly stating their assumptions,” said Prof Wolfram Schlenker, at Columbia University, US.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Do you know how can I use kitchen scissors?", "output": "Cooks know the importance of a good knife, but many miss out on the versatility of kitchen scissors and shears. Shears are larger than scissors and may have serrated blades that make them better at butchering meat. Both are good cutting up all sorts of foods, including breads, herbs, fruits, and vegetables. In addition, many scissors and shears have grips on the end for cracking shells and removing bottle caps. For a safer, simpler alternative to knives, reach for a pair of scissors.\n1. Scissors cut into slippery meats, including fish, and small spaces with less difficulty than knives. Stick the scissor tips into the belly of the fish near the tail. Cut along the belly to the head. Use the scissors to snip off the head along with the fins. You can then cleanly cut out the meat you want without dirtying a cutting board.\n\nFor poultry, cut out the backbone or rib cage to open up the bird. Cut off the wings and thighs where they connect to the body. These joints are small, so it’s easier to clip them with scissors instead of a knife.\nIt’s also easier to trim bacon into pieces with scissors.\n2. With kitchen scissors, there’s little risk of slipping and cutting yourself. Leafy herbs such as basil and oregano are easily harvested by snipping the leaves off at the stems. To break down the leaves, place them in a bowl and cut away until they’re as small as you want them. You’ll get clean cuts without bruising the leaves.\nSolid herbs and spices like garlic and ginger are also very easy to cut into pieces with scissors.\n3. Leafy tops, such as on carrots and strawberries, can be clipped off without much of a struggle. Scissors also help in removing roots or woody stems on scallions and mushrooms. For broccoli, cut the florets off at the stem.\nThe sharper blade can also be used to scrape off dark spots and other blemishes.\n4. Scissors are a handy tool in baking. After laying phyllo or puff pastry flat, trim it to size. The scissors make clean, even cuts. For pie dough, lay the dough in the pie tin and snip around the edges to remove the excess.\n\nScissors are also a great way to form a lattice by cutting dough into a strip and laying it over the pie.\nScissors also aid in precision cutting for pasta dough, such as when forming ravioli.\n5. This is particularly useful for canned tomatoes, which are very messy when taken out of the can. Leave them in there and snip at them with the scissors until they’re broken down into smaller pieces. Then you can pour them into a pan without losing any of the juice.\nThis also works with other canned food, such as pineapple rings and peppers.\n6. Scissors are perfect for making any food bite-sized, but they work especially well for bread. Trim around the crust to remove it cleanly, leaving the rest of the bread whole. Leftover bread can be clipped evenly into cubes for stuffing, bread pudding, croutons, or other recipes.\n\nScissors also allow you to cut pitas into evenly-sized wedges.\nScissors can even cut pizzas and quesadillas after they’ve been cooked.\n7. These dried products are small and slippery, making them difficult to cut with a knife. Place them between the scissor blades and cut them in half. It’s a no-hassle way to break down foods such as raisins or sun-dried tomatoes.\n8. Scissors and shears have grips between the handles, which are strong enough to crack open crab claws and lobster shells. The scissor blades are useful for cutting neatly through thinner shells, such as the ones on shrimp. With knives, this is difficult and you’d also need a shell cracker.\nFor shrimp, push the scissor blades under the shell. Cut along the vein, then peel off the shell by hand. The vein will also pop right out.\n9. Although kitchen scissors are meant for food, they open packaging just as well as normal scissors. This is very helpful in the kitchen when your hands are slippery or a package doesn’t tear properly. You can also cut off ties without stopping to undo them.\nKitchen scissors are handy for vacuum-sealed packaging that can’t be torn apart by hand.\n10. Kitchen shears have plier-like teeth between the handle grips. Place a plastic cap, such as the one on your bottle of hot sauce, between the handles. Set the bottle on the table so you don’t drop it. Hold the scissors level with the table, then twist until the seal breaks.\nTo remove large lids, angle the scissors upwards and away from your body. Then grip the lid between the handles and twist.\n11. You don’t need to fish around for a bottle opener. Place the bottle cap between the handles and squeeze them closed. The scissors should point upwards and away from your body. Lift them until the cap pops off.\n12. Scissors make snipping off a piece of string or twine easy. Tie the twine around a bag or container to secure its contents. Twine is also used for trussing chickens and turkeys, which makes them cook evenly.\n13. Treat them like any other kitchen utensil. Every time you use the scissors, bacteria gets on the blades, which is transferred to the next food you cut. At the very least, they need to be washed after working with raw meat. To stay safe, wash the scissors off every time you use them.\nAfter cutting meat, make sure you wash the scissors before using them on any other food.\n14. Look where the blades meet each other. If they are fastened together with a screw, don’t try to separate the blades. Other shears can be pulled apart. They may slide off each other or have an unlocking knob in the handle. Consult the owner’s manual for exact details on how to separate the blades.\nIf you can’t separate the blades, you can still wash them. Separating them only makes cleaning easier.\n15. The scissors need to be washed like any other kitchen utensil. Use your normal dish detergent along with hot water. Make sure the soap reaches the spots where the blades cross or meet the handles. A lot of bacteria can grow there, especially if your scissors don’t come apart.\nSome kitchen scissors are designed to be washed in the dishwasher. Check the packaging or instructions to make sure this is okay.\n16. Get a clean cloth and wipe down the blades. Remove all the water, including in those hard-to-reach areas like near the handles. Water rusts metal, and it’s a shame to see a costly, quality pair of scissors turn brown and fragile.\nEven if you wash the scissors in the dishwasher, it’s a good idea to dry them by hand to avoid rusting.\n17. Lay them on a drying rack, if you have one. You can also lay a paper towel or piece of newspaper on your counter. Spread the scissor blades out on the surface you chose. Leave the scissors there for a few minutes so any remaining moisture dries.\n18. Contact with other metal dulls the blades, so don’t throw them in your utensil drawer. A knife block is a perfect place to store the scissors. If they don’t fit in the block, keep them in a separate drawer away from the other utensils.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "What is the scope of local law enforcement's use of drones and the privacy implications?", "output": "EFF is proud to announce that MuckRock, an open government organization dedicated to helping people send requests for public records, is joining our campaign to find out what local police agencies are doing with drones — and how we can stop their use for surveillance. We are sending out public records requests to every local law enforcement agency with a drone authorization from the FAA. In addition, MuckRock is offering their tools and inviting users to help write their own public records requests to police agencies in their town.\nIn January, we filed suit against the FAA under the Freedom of Information Act requesting information on the recipients of authorization to fly drones in the U.S. The FAA responded by releasing a list of approximately 60 entities that have applied for drone certificates, including over 30 local law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the FAA refused to release information about the types of drones these agencies were flying and for what purpose.\nTwo weeks ago, we asked EFF members to help us find out. We provided a list of seven simple questions you can ask your local police station by calling them up — and dozens of you did just that. But now we have some help in case the police are unresponsive.\nEFF already received a response from the Miami-Dade police department from a request we previously filed. The result was good news. It was the first unredacted drone Certificate of Authorization made public, and the department laid out restrictions on its use: they could not fly a drone within city limits or over populated areas, and it does not store images. Similarly, we've heard from the Texas Department of Public Safety that it hasn't flown its drones since completing training flights in August 2010.\nNow, we want to find out if other agencies are restricted in the same sorts of ways.\nRemember, while we currently only know of 60 public agencies with drones, the number of drone authorizations in the US is predicted to explode over the next few years—as many as 30,000 by the end of the decade. Congress passed a law in February mandating the FAA authorize use to public agencies if the applicant prove they can operate them safely, and Homeland Security Department is spending millions of dollars on a program to “facilitate and accelerate” their use by local law enforcement.\nAs we’ve explained before, the privacy implications are unprecedented. They can operate undetected and use sensors ranging from high-resolution cameras to heat detectors and more, and may not be subject to the same Fourth Amendment restrictions as human investigators. Ryan Calo, a prominent researcher who has written extensively about drones, has argued that drones could provide a necessary \"visceral jolt\" to our conception of privacy. But in order to shape policy around drones and surveillance, Americans must know the scope of law enforcement intentions.\nPopular pushback may already be working. Even as states from Florida to Ohio to Connecticut to Oregon compete to run drone test sites, federal legislators are increasingly raising concerns about the bigger picture for domestic drones. Rep. Michael Burgess of Texas is among several lawmakers citing \"constituents ... concerned about privacy\" in reconsidering the free hand and short timeline that Congress have given the FAA. Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia and Sen. Rand Paul have separately introduced legislation to rein in domestic drone usage.\nAs with any new technology, drones present both possibilities and potential for abuse by law enforcement. A transparent and public discussion about how law enforcement agents will use them — that starts with real information from the agencies — is the only way to ensure that this new technology doesn't encroach upon our civil liberties.\nSo if you're wondering what your own police agency may be doing with drones go here and fill out this simple form so MuckRock can send them a public records request for you.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain the regulations and policies related to fracking in the UK.", "output": "Rules designed to halt fracking operations if they trigger minor earthquakes could be relaxed as the shale industry begins to expand, the UK energy minister, Claire Perry, has said.\nA series of small tremors seven years ago prompted tough regulations that mean even very low levels of seismic activity now require companies to suspend fracking.\nThe shale gas firm Cuadrilla plans to start fracking near Blackpool this week if it can see off a last-minute legal challenge on Thursday.\nIf seismic sensors detect anything above 0.5 magnitude on the Richter scale – far below what people can feel at the surface – the company would have to stop and review its operations.\nBut Perry has told a fellow Conservative MP that the monitoring system was “set at an explicitly cautious level … as we gain experience in applying these measures, the trigger levels can be adjusted upwards without compromising the effectiveness of the controls”.\nThe comments were made in a letter to Kevin Hollinrake, the MP for Thirsk and Malton, whose constituency has several prospective fracking sites. The letter was obtained by Greenpeace’s investigative unit, Unearthed.\nHe said the limits showed the government was taking a very cautious and responsible approach to fracking.\nThe industry is regulated by a traffic light system introduced after the 2011 tremors. Green is zero-magnitude on the Richter scale, amber is anything up to 0.5, meaning fracking should proceed with caution and potentially at a slower rate, and red is anything at 0.5-magnitude or greater, meaning operations are suspended immediately.\nCuadrilla said it would be fracking slowly at its Preston New Road site near Blackpool because of concerns over seismic activity, meaning the process will take about two and a half months rather than the fortnight it would take in the US. The company is publishing seismicity data online.\nAny relaxation of the stringent seismicity rules imposed on operators would help speed up exploratory fracking.\nExperts said there was room for raising the limits because they had been set so low to start with. “That threshold [of 0.5 magnitude] is way below the size of an earthquake anyone is likely to feel. People start to feel quakes around 1.5 to 2.0, so you’ve got one order of magnitude to play around with before they are felt by people,” said Dr Brian Baptie, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey.\nIf the limit was raised to 1.5, it would be on a par with two of the tremors felt by people near Blackpool in 2011. But it would still be far from the level where a quake would do any damage to buildings, and below the thresholds for blasts during quarrying, which can go up to 2.0.\nShe pointed to problems with fracking in the light of this week’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which said there were only 12 years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C if the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people were not to worsen.\n“Given yesterday’s climate report, it’s crucial that the fracking industry is stopped permanently and the government invests in energy efficiency and renewables so that we don’t need to use so much gas to supply our homes, offices and buildings,” she said.\nThe Labour MP visited Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road site in Lancashire on Monday, meeting with local people concerned at the impact of fracking.\nCuadrilla’s hopes of beginning fracking this week hinge on whether it can fend off an eleventh-hour legal challenge brought by a retired Lancashire businessman, Bob Bennett, against Lancashire county council.\nOn Thursday at 2pm, the high court will hear evidence from lawyers for the council, the company and Bennett, over whether sufficient measures are in place in the case of an emergency at the site.\n“People’s concerns about how to evacuate the area in the event of a well blowout or gas leak at the fracking are being sidelined by Lancashire county council”, said Bennett.\nThe government said the rules around seismicity could not be changed without a consultation.\nA spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK’s world class oil and gas regulations, which have a track record of success that goes back decades, will ensure that shale development can only happen safely and in an environmentally responsible way.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Describe how Toyota Motor Corp is investing in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.", "output": "TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) is doubling down on its investment in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, designing lower-cost, mass-market passenger cars and SUVs and pushing the technology into buses and trucks to build economies of scale.\nAs Toyota cranks up improvements for the next generation of its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV), expected in the early 2020s, it is hoping it can prove wrong rival automakers and industry experts who have mostly dismissed such plans as commercially unviable.\nThe maker of the Prius, the world’s first mass-produced “eco-friendly” gasoline-hybrid car in the 1990s, says it can popularize FCVs in part by making them cheaper.\n“We’re going to shift from limited production to mass production, reduce the amount of expensive materials like platinum used in FCV components, and make the system more compact and powerful,” Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the Mirai, said in an interview with Reuters.\nIt is planning a phased introduction of other FCV models, including a range of SUVs, pick-up trucks, and commercial trucks beginning around 2025, a source with knowledge of the automaker’s plans said.\nThe automaker declined to comment on specific future product plans. But it has developed FCV prototypes of small delivery vehicles and large transport trucks based on models already on the road, as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) develops a battery-operated commercial semi-truck from the ground up.\nThe company is also betting on improved performance. Toyota wants to push the driving range of the next Mirai to 700-750 kilometers from around 500 kilometers, and to hit 1,000 kilometers by 2025, a separate source said.\nDriven by the belief that hydrogen will become a key source of clean energy in the next 100 years, Toyota has been developing FCVs since the early 1990s.\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and stores more energy than a battery of equivalent weight.\nThe Mirai was the world’s first production FCV when it was launched in 2014. But its high cost, around $60,000 before government incentives, and lack of refueling infrastructure have limited its appeal. Fewer than 6,000 have been sold globally.\nLMC Automotive forecasts FCVs to make up only 0.2 percent of global passenger car sales in 2027, compared with 11.7 percent for battery EVs. The International Energy Agency predicts fewer FCVs than battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles through 2040.\nMany automakers, including Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Tesla, see battery-powered cars as a better, zero-emission solution to gasoline engines. Only a handful, including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), produce FCVs.\nBut people familiar with Toyota’s plans said the automaker thinks demand will perk up as more countries, including China, warm to fuel cell technology. The company also sees FCVs as a hedge against a scarcity of key EV battery materials such as cobalt.\nFor now, Mirais are assembled by hand at a plant in Toyota City, where 13 technicians push partially constructed units into assembly bays for detailed inspections. This process yields just 6.5 cars a day, a sliver of Toyota’s average domestic daily production of about 13,400 vehicles.\nStrategic Analysis Inc, which has analyzed costs of FCVs including the Mirai, estimates that it costs Toyota about $11,000 to produce each of its fuel cell stacks, by far the vehicles’ most expensive part.\nToyota has been building up production capacity to change that, as it expects global FCV sales climb to 30,000 units annually after 2020 from about 3,000. Strategic Analysis estimates that would allow Toyota to reduce costs to about $8,000 per stack.\nIt has already begun to use parts developed for the Mirai in other models, such as the fuel cell stack, which is used in Kenworth freight trucks being tested in California, the Sora FC bus it released in Japan in March and the delivery trucks it will test with Seven-Eleven stores in Japan next year.\n“It will be difficult for Toyota to lower FCV production costs if it only produces the Mirai,” the first source told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.\n“By using the FCV system in larger models, it is looking to lower costs by mass-producing and using common parts across vehicle classes,” he added.\nThe Mirai’s high production costs are largely due to expensive materials including platinum, titanium and carbon fiber used in the fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems.\nEngineers have been reducing that by improving the platinum catalyst, a key component in the 370 layered cells in the fuel cell stack, which facilitates the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces electricity.\n“We’ve been able to decrease the platinum loading by 10 percent to 20 percent and deliver the same performance,” said Eri Ichikawa, a fuel cell engineer at Cataler Corp, a Toyota subsidiary that specializes in catalytic converters.\nStrategic Analysis says using that much less of the precious metal would save up to $300 per fuel cell stack, based on an estimate that Toyota now uses about 30 grams of platinum per unit.\n“By consistently focusing on these issues, we will be able to progressively lower the cost of FCVs in the future,” Tanaka said.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

It was an unpleasant surprise when Ed found his store in disarray after 7:00 a.m. one bitterly cold morning in January. Upon inspection, Ed learned that a thief had broken in the back door. The burglar’s plan would have been to steal money from the brass plated, old-fashioned cash register in the middle of the shop. However, the intruder did not realize that Ed emptied the contents of the cash drawer every night. Ed took extra precaution to protect his business, and hid the money for bank deposit in a floor safe underneath the antique roll top desk in his small office. The thief had done a fair amount of damage. Besides the damaged rear door, there were table and mantle clocks strewn about on the shop floor. There was also a broken display case. To make matters worse, a mouse had bitten into a lamp cord in the front shop area and Ed had to reset the circuit breaker to get the electricity back on. Ed noticed that three of his clocks and two watches were no longer running. It was a source of pride for Ed that the greatest majority of the clocks and watches in his shop worked properly at all times. Of course, he would often find one or two in need of winding or battery replacement, but this was a tiny percentage of the more than 200 clocks and watches in the store. He was careful to sell only the pieces that kept accurate time, regardless of the age and skill level needed to maintain them. Before calling the police, Ed noted the times on the clocks and watches that had stopped working. One watch and one of the clocks not working were on the floor, knocked over by the intruder in his nervous and angry haste. The other two clocks and watch remained in their normal places, apparently undamaged. However, Ed knew from previous experience that something as mild as a door slamming in the small shop would often cause one of his old clocks or watches to stop running. Ed discovered that a grandfather clock manufactured in 1929 had stopped running at 10:10 p.m., a little over an hour after he went home the previous evening. An early 20th century mantle clock which he found on the floor was stopped at 10:59 p.m., and an office clock mounted on the wall with a 1955 manufacturing stamp on the back of it was frozen at 2:01 a.m. A 1970s era battery-operated wristwatch, which was on the floor, had quit running at 3:18 a.m., and a beautiful old silver pocket watch from the 1880s was stuck at 5:22 a.m. Ed surveyed the damage. Numbly, by habit, he placed a new battery in the wristwatch and it began ticking. He set it to the current time: 7:29 a.m. Ed knew the intruder was in the shop between the hours of 10:10 p.m. and 5:22 a.m. Cursing silently, (as he chastised himself for not having a burglar alarm installed) he called the police department. It was a few minutes after 8 o’clock when his old friend, Detective Wesley Bingham, arrived at the shop. Ed poured hot coffee for both of them. Detective Bingham knew his friend well and realized that Ed would have a detailed assessment of what happened. Wisely, he allowed the older man to speak without interfering with questions. Ed began, “Some time between 10:10 last night and 5:22 this morning, somebody broke into the shop. Whoever it was broke down the back door and entered the front area. Perhaps because he needed to leave the lights off, he knocked several objects over and broke a display case. He must have been nervous, in a hurry and very angry after he saw the cash register drawer open and empty.” Bingham sipped on his coffee and replied, “Please continue.” “Nothing is missing,” Ed told him, “but three clocks and two watches were not running this morning. They were all stopped at different times. I suspect one of them quit running when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case.” Ed relayed to the detective the timepieces and respective times they had quit working. Bingham thought for a moment, and then asked, “Tell me what you observed about each timepiece.” Ed warmed to his topic. He was coming down from the initial shock of finding his beloved clock store vandalized. The hot coffee and comforting presence of old friend helped him organize his thoughts. He began to think out loud. “The grandfather clock sits in the corner, over there.” Ed pointed to the corner farthest from the cash register and broken display case. “There are no signs of visible damage, the clock appears normal. Obviously, it was not in thief’s path of destruction. The burglar would have to really shake the place for the grandfather clock to stop. Normally, the only time such a clock stops is if the weights and chains are tangled.” Bingham asked, “What about the mantle clock?” Ed replied, “The mantle clock was on the floor. It took a pretty good lick. There’s a dent in the wooden floor, but it’s made of heavy brass and only has a slight scratch. I have to accept a little bit of blame for that one being on the floor. I was looking at it last night just before going home and left it sitting too close to the edge of the counter. I found that it needs a cleaning. I guess I will do that today and look for damage.” Ed poured a second cup of coffee for both of them before continuing, “The pocket watch is in a display case by the front window. Nothing in that case was affected by my visitor … it’s too far from the center of the room.” He smiled and continued, “Pocket watches from the late 1800s are tough and were built to withstand horse and wagon rides.” Pulling it from the case, he showed it to the detective. “It’s made of silver, one of my favorites. I just rebuilt it last week.” Bingham smiled at his friend. It always pleased him that Ed had been blessed with a passion that allowed him to earn a living. He knew that Ed’s love of timepieces had sustained him since the death of his wife. Finally, he asked, “What about the other watch?” Ed said, “It does not appear to be damaged, even though it was on the floor. A new battery has it running just fine now.” Bingham asked, “How about the wall clock?” “That’s one of those commercial electric wall clocks from the 1950s,” Ed said. “The kind you used to see in offices everywhere. It still has its original cord and plug. However, it didn’t appear that the thief was anywhere near it.” Wesley Bingham answered, “Well, Ed, I have some news for you. A young man named Aubrey Behrens was arrested early this morning. One of your neighbors on the block saw him loitering on the sidewalk. He was arrested and brought to the station before you called. He has cuts and bruises on his hands and arms. His girlfriend was with him, and she swears they were together at her place just before their arrest. I need to know when Behrens was in the shop. I can tear their story apart and rattle him if I have a timeline on this breaking and entering.” Ed smiled and said, “Wesley, now that I have had time to think this through, I can give you the exact time that he was here.” When was Behrens in the shop?", "output": "Wesley smiled back, “I’m not surprised. I’ve always known you would have made a great detective.”\n\n“You know it has to do with the times on the clocks and watches when they stopped running. Often old clocks and watches just quit running. But, I knew right away it wasn’t the battery-operated watch. A new battery got it running again immediately. The old battery simply died. The grandfather clock had not been disturbed. It was too far away from the action to be shaken and the weight and chain mechanism was normal. Again, sometimes an old clock or watch just stops and that is what happened with the grandfather. The same is true with the pocket watch. It was undisturbed in the front case, far from the burglar’s sphere of influence. That type of watch was built to withstand shock. I probably goofed when rebuilding it last week.”\n\nHe continued, “The electric wall clock stopped when the mouse bit into the lamp cord, tripping the shop area circuit breaker.” Pausing, he looked Bingham in the eye and said, “That leaves the mantle clock. A heavy clock like that would normally withstand a fall to a soft wood floor, but it needs a cleaning and it did not take much to make it quit running.”\n\nWith disgust and anger evident in his voice, he said to Wesley, “You may ask your suspect why he felt it necessary to illegally enter my shop around 10:59 p.m. last night.”", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Can good sense of humor protect you from stress?", "output": "Ask a psychologist the answer to this question – posed in this case by Morrissey in The Smiths song, How soon is now? – and she might reply “within the next three seconds”.\nThe idea that “now”, also known as the “subjective present”, is constrained within this time limit has proved popular. But a new evaluation in Psychological Bulletin of dozens of research papers on everything from embraces and reading poetry to tapping along to a beat concludes that there’s no good evidence for it. Our experience of the present cannot, it seems, be so strictly defined.\nPlenty of events that we perceive as happening at the same time actually don’t quite co-occur, of course. An intriguing illustration of this comes, for example, from the neurological patient known in the literature as PH. This man hears people’s voices before he registers the movement of their lips. At first, he thought the TV wasn’t correctly dubbed, but then he realised the same thing was happening with people he was talking to. Evaluation of his case led the researchers involved to conclude that there are various clocks in the brain, and PH has developed problems with the coordination of those linked to vision and hearing.\nStill, there’s only about a 200-millisecond time difference between our brain’s processing of the sight of someone’s lips moving and the sound of their voice. So how big can a discrepancy get for a healthy brain not only to cease perceiving events as simultaneous, but to stop binding perceptions together into “the present”?\nIn his new critique of the three-second theory, Peter White at Cardiff University first considers evidence put forward from experiments into duration perception: if someone sounds a tone for two seconds, say, or eight seconds, how good is somebody else at holding down a button for the same length of time?\nErnst Pöppel at the Ludwig-Maximillian University of Munich, Germany, has claimed that at about three seconds or under, we’re accurate, but beyond that, we under-estimate durations – which, he’s argued, supports the idea of two different brain processing modes: one for events that last less than three seconds, and one for events that take longer. This supports the idea that “now” lasts up to three seconds, he argues. In fact, a clear-cut boundary between performance below or over three-second durations does not exist, argues White. Rather, it seems that as the duration of a tone gradually gets longer, our performance tends to gradually worsen, too, and there’s no clear evidence of a shift in accuracy at the three-second mark.\nHow about work investigating how well we can tap along to a beat? While some studies support the idea that we’re relatively accurate when the beat intervals are less than three seconds (which, again, Pöppel argues, suggests that we automatically process and integrate events that take three seconds or less as chunks of “now”), others just don’t, White points out.\nBut there’s a significant methodological problem with at least some of the research, agues White: “How is a behavioural unit identified?” White cites research finding that when lay volunteers are shown videos or animations of human behaviour – such as an actor using a keyboard or chasing someone – and are asked to break these behaviours down into the smallest units that seem natural, their segments generally last a lot longer than three seconds.\nCan a good sense of humour protect you from stress?", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Keto, low carb, and gluten free recipe.\nThe pressure cooker is an easy and foolproof method of cooking hard boiled eggs so that they’re easy to peel. It takes 5 minutes for each of these steps: pressurizing the pot, high pressure cooking, and natural pressure release.\nSince the egg shells peel off effortlessly, you can easily use the cooked eggs to make my favorite low carb deviled eggs. I add sriracha to spice them up, and I top them with crispy crumbled bacon for an extra crunch.\nIf deviled eggs aren’t your thing, you can use the cooked eggs to make an egg salad or an egg sandwich.\nYou don’t need a specialized egg rack to cook perfect hard boiled eggs. You can use a trivet, like the one that came with your Instant Pot (pictured above), or a steam rack.\nSame goes for deviled eggs. You don’t need a pastry bag and tip in order to pipe the filling into each egg; instead, use a small sandwich plastic bag and cut a small corner of it. Works just as well.\nIt’s best to remove the yolks as cleanly as possible from the egg whites. In my experience, the yolks will easily pop out if you use a small spoon to apply pressure as you scoop it out.\nYou need to be gentle so that you don’t accidentally break the egg whites in the process.\nIf you’re having trouble with yolk removal, you may want to cook the eggs tip-point down to center the yolk.\nThese deviled eggs come with a spicy surprise… there’s a small dollop of sriracha squirted into the empty egg whites before the yolk mixture is added.\nI usually add a tiny amount, like 1/4 teaspoon per egg white half, for mildly spicy deviled eggs. You can easily adjust the amount to match your preferences.\nYou can prepare your toppings while the eggs are cooking in the pressure cooker. The bacon will take the longest, and since you only need a small amount (1 slice) for topping, you can simply cook it in the microwave.\nI usually cover the raw bacon slice with multiple paper towels and microwave for 2 1/2 minutes or until crispy. You may need to microwave for shorter or longer periods of time depending on your particular microwave.\nOther ways to cook bacon include frying it on a pan or baking it in the oven.\nAfter assembling the deviled eggs and adding toppings, store them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\nPersonally, I much prefer the taste of chilled deviled eggs and not the room temperature freshly made ones, so it’s best to plan ahead so that you have time to refrigerate them.\nUse the Instant Pot for easy-to-peel hard boiled eggs, great for making these easy and spicy deviled eggs. Keto, low carb, and gluten free recipe.\nPeel and slice each egg lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the egg yolks into a large mixing bowl, and mash them. Add mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well.\nUsing sriracha in its squeeze bottle, squirt about 1/4 teaspoon of sriracha into each empty egg white.\nScoop the egg yolk mixture into a small sandwich plastic bag. Cut off a tiny corner, and pipe the filling over each egg white. Alternatively, use a pastry bag and tip.\nGarnish with paprika, chives, and crumbled bacon. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nThis recipe yields 0.5 g net carbs per serving (1 deviled egg or 1/12 of recipe).\nAbsolutely delicious and super easy!!\nYay, I’m glad it turned out really well for you!!\nIf you use more than 6 eggs at a time does the cooking time change?\nHey Rita!

It is amazing for car lovers as it proves a good experience for the users including graphics, cars, sound, place and many more that you can observe. While you may enjoy Asphalt 8, all gamers go through a time when it is difficult to be good at it. This article will provide tips to help you get through those times. So, just follow the described journey and be a good racer in Asphalt 8.\n1. You will start the game with the Dodge Dart GT (a Class D car), but you must buy better and [eventually] higher class cars to remain competitive and progress through Single Player mode. \n\nBuy a car that has good acceleration and handling so you can get a head start in races by knocking down other cars and finish the race without wrecking many times. If you're a beginner, make sure that your car has at least 1.200 for handling. If you're a pro that can control your car, you don't have to worry about your car's handling.\nFor beginners, it's a good idea to buy the Audi R8 and E-tron and Tesla Model S also for Class D.\n2. Start a race in Single Player mode, start knocking down other cars, and try to complete all levels with flying colors.\n3. Some shortcut roads are short while some are long. To find the shortest shortcut road on every track, just go across the road without using nitro.\nPlease keep in mind that you should always use the short way unless your nitro is very fast. For that, you have to explore places. Great Wall have nearly 6 routes. There is a good chance for you to find shortcuts.\n4. Racing with players from around the world is harder than you think.\n\nWhen playing in Multiplayer mode, remember shortcut road, plan your strategy and your way to go across before the race starts.\nThe higher your level is, the more money you get.\n5. Try doing a Barrel Roll, Flat Spin, and other driving techniques to gain nitro and gain precious seconds.\n\nTo do a barrel roll, drive your car off of a curved ramp.\nThough a barrel roll is easy, the trick to a flat spin is to just drift when you arrive at a ramp and you will automatically do a flat spin.\n6. If you have enough credits to upgrade your car's performance, take the opportunity to do so. This will give you greater results during the races.\n\nBe clever. Remember that Acceleration and Top Speed alone will not lead you to victory. Upgrading your Handling lets you have more control and avoid crashes during a race.\nAcceleration can push your car faster! Upgrade your car's Acceleration if you need some extra speed.\nUpgrade to maximum speed! Do this to upgrade your Speed and Acceleration.\nHave Nitro. It is the most powerful thing and must-have if you want to win the race. Upgrade it so you can cut another racer easily and knock down another racer easily in Single Player!\n7. Don't worry about other players, because aggressive play is needed in Asphalt 8 to burn down your friend's (or enemy's) position. It can also lead you to victory.\n\nKnock down as many cars as you can! To knock down other racers, hit up your Nitro and ram or hit them. Try to knock down all of them.\nIn Multiplayer mode, it's hard to knock down other players. Gameloft just changes their game knockdown mode to balance so everybody can safely play the game. However, this is not bad news. To knock down other racers in Multiplayer mode, flank them from the side and push them to the wall as hard as you can. This will automatically knock them down.\nAlternatively, you could simply hit up a maximum 100% Nitro with a Top Speed nitro (more than 35km/h nitro speed). Hit them from their back to knock them down!\n\nYou can also use the Death From Above tactical strike to knock down other racers. Ram them into a ramp and hit them from the skies.\n8. Practice drifting perfectly without crashing or being hit! This will automatically refuel your Nitro. When on the straight road, try to do some small drifts; however please note that drifting can slow your vehicle.\nPractice Knockdowns to refuel your Nitro by\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

He learns that he is being tracked by Shiro Kuramori, a reporter hired by parasite Ryoko Tamiya. Shiro discovers the truth about Migi, and plans to expose Shinichi. Shinichi tells Shiro that Tamiya is a parasite, and urges him to stop getting involved for the sake of his safety.

He lures Goto to a disposal facility and is able to fatally injure him. At first reluctant in killing him, Shinichi ultimately decides that he wants to protect his loved ones, and finishes Goto off. Back home, Migi tells a dismayed Shinichi that since the parasites have died down, he will now go into hibernation to achieve an evolution, presumably up to the point where the two will never see each other again, breaking Shinichis heart. A few years later, Shinichi and Satomi visit the now toddler son of Tamiya, who is named Taiki Tamiya. Afterward, Uragami appears, kidnaps Satomi, and takes her to a roof. He states his belief that humans are the real monsters and asks for Shinichis opinion, since he is certain that Shinichi is a parasite. However, with Satomis encouragement, Shinichi defies Uragamis opinion and successfully saves Satomi with help from Migi, who had momentarily awakened from his dormant state to help him.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Collations that are used with character data types such as char and varchar dictate the code page and corresponding characters that can be represented for that data type. Whether you are installing a new instance of SQL Server, restoring a database backup, or connecting server to client databases, it is important that you understand the locale requirements, sorting order, and case and accent sensitivity of the data that you will be working with.\n\nThis means that Collation is very important as it specifies rules on how character strings of the data are sorted and compared.\nNote: More info on COLLATIONPROPERTY\nNow Lets first understand the differences ......\nRunning below T-SQL :\nSELECT *\nFROM::fn_helpcollations()\nWHERE NAME IN (\n

'kin_test1'\nGO\n\n--- This will NOT have IMPLICIT Conversion\n\nThe reason for Implicit conversion is because, I have my database & Server collation both as SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS and the table Table_Latin1_General_CI_AS has column Comments defined as VARCHAR(50) with COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS, so during the lookup SQL Server has to do an IMPLICIT conversion.\nTest 3:\nWith the same set up, now we will compare the varchar columns with nvarchar values to see the changes in the execution plans.\n-- run the query\nDBCC FREEPROCCACHE\nGO\nSELECT Comments FROM Table_Latin1_General_CI_AS

N'kin_test1'\nGO\n\nNote that the first query is able to do Index seek but has to do Implicit conversion while the second one does an Index scan which prove to be inefficient in terms of performance when it will scan large tables.\nConclusion :\n\nAll of the above tests shows that having right collation is very important for your database server instance. \nSQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS is a SQL collation with the rules that allow you to sort data for unicode and non-unicode are different.\nSQL collation wont be able to use Index when comparing unicode and non-unicode data as seen in above tests that when comparing nvarchar data to varchar data, it does Index scan and not seek.\nLatin1_General_CI_AS is a Windows collation with the rules that allow you to sort data for unicode and non-unicode are same.\nWindows collation can still use Index (Index seek in above example) when comparing unicode and non-unicode data but you see a slight performance penalty.\nHighly recommend to read Erland Sommarskog answer + the connect items that he has pointed to.\n\nThis will allow me to not have problems with #temp tables, but are there pitfalls?\n\nSee my answer above.\n\nWould I lose any functionality or features of any kind by not using a \"current\" collation of SQL 2008?\n\nIt all depends on what functionality/features you are referring to. Collation is storing and sorting of data.\n\nWhat about when we move (e.g. in 2 years ) from 2008 to SQL 2012? Will I have problems then? Would I at some point be forced to go to Latin1_General_CI_AS?\n\nCant vouch ! As things might change in and its always good to be inline with Microsoft's suggestion + you need to understand your data and the pitfalls that I mentioned above. Also refer to this and this connect items.\n\nI read that some DBA's script complete the rows of complete databases, and then run the insert script into the database with the new collation - I'm very scared and wary of this - would you recommend doing this?\n\nWhen you want to change collation, then such scripts are useful. I have found myself changing collation of databases to match server collation many times and I have some scripts that does it pretty neat. Let me know if you need it.\nReferences :\n\nStorage and Performance Effects of Unicode\nWorking with Collations\nCollation and Unicode Support\nCode Page Architecture", "output": "In addition to what @Kin detailed in his answer, there are a few more things to be aware of when switching the server's (i.e. instance's) default collation (items above the horizontal line are directly relevant to the two collations mentioned in the Question; items below the horizontal line are relevant to the general):\n\nIF YOUR DATABASE'S DEFAULT COLLATION IS NOT CHANGING, then the \"implicit conversion\" performance issue described in @Kin's answer should not be a problem since string literals and local variables use the Database's default Collation, not the server's. The only impacts for the scenario in which the instance level Collation is changed but not the database level Collation are (both described in detail below):\n\npotential collation conflicts with temporary tables (but not table variables).\npotential broken code if casing of variables and/or cursors does not match their declarations (but this can only happen if moving to an instance with a binary or case-sensitive collation).\n\nOne difference between these two Collations is in how they sort certain characters for VARCHAR data (this does not affect NVARCHAR data). The non-EBCDIC SQL_ Collations use what is called \"String Sort\" for VARCHAR data, while all other Collations, and even NVARCHAR data for the non-EBCDIC SQL_ Collations, use what is called \"Word Sort\". The difference is that in \"Word Sort\", the dash - and apostrophe ' (and maybe a few other characters?) are given a very low weight and are essentially ignored unless there are no other differences in the strings. To see this behavior in action, run the following:\nDECLARE @Test TABLE (Col1 VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL);\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('aa');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('ac');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('ah');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('am');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('aka');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('akc');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('ar');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('a-f');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('a_e');\nINSERT INTO @Test VALUES ('a''kb');\n\nSELECT * FROM @Test ORDER BY [Col1] COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS;\n-- \"String Sort\" puts all punctuation ahead of letters\n\nSELECT * FROM @Test ORDER BY [Col1] COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AS;\n-- \"Word Sort\" mostly ignores dash and apostrophe\n\nReturns:\nString Sort\n-----------\na'kb\na-f\na_e\naa\nac\nah\naka\nakc\nam\nar\n\nand:\nWord Sort\n---------\na_e\naa\nac\na-f\nah\naka\na'kb\nakc\nam\nar\n\nWhile you will \"lose\" the \"String Sort\" behavior, I'm not sure that I would call that a \"feature\". It is a behavior that has been deemed undesirable (as evidenced by the fact that it wasn't brought forward into any of the Windows collations). However, it is a definite difference of behavior between the two collations (again, just for non-EBCDIC VARCHAR data), and you might have code and/or customer expectations based upon the \"String Sort\" behavior. This requires testing your code and possibly researching to see if this change in behavior might have any negative impact on users.\nAnother difference between SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS and Latin1_General_100_CI_AS is the ability to do Expansions on VARCHAR data (NVARCHAR data can already do these for most SQL_ Collations), such as handling æ as if it were ae:\nIF ('æ' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS =\n    'ae' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS)\nBEGIN\n  PRINT 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS';\nEND;\n\nIF ('æ' COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AS =\n    'ae' COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CI_AS)\nBEGIN\n  PRINT 'Latin1_General_100_CI_AS';\nEND;\n\nReturns:\nLatin1_General_100_CI_AS\n\nThe only thing you are \"losing\" here is not being able to do these expansions. Generally speaking, this is another benefit of moving to a Windows Collation. However, just like with the \"String Sort\" to \"Word Sort\" move, the same caution applies: it is a definite difference of behavior between the two collations (again, just for VARCHAR data), and you might have code and/or customer expectations based upon not having these mappings. This requires testing your code and possibly researching to see if this change in behavior might have any negative impact on users.\n(first noted in this S.O. answer by @Zarepheth: Can SQL Server SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS be safely converted to Latin1_General_CI_AS?)\nThe server-level collation is used to set the collation of the system databases, which includes [model]. The [model] database is used as a template to create new databases, which includes [tempdb] upon each server startup. But, even with a change of server-level collation changing the collation of [tempdb], there is a somewhat easy way to correct for collation differences between the database that is \"current\" when CREATE #TempTable is executed and [tempdb]. When creating temporary tables, declare a collation using the COLLATE clause and specify a collation of DATABASE_DEFAULT:\nCREATE TABLE #Temp (Col1 NVARCHAR(40) COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT);\n\nIt is best to use the most recent version of the desired collation, if multiple versions are available. Starting in SQL Server 2005, a \"90\" series of collations was introduced, and SQL Server 2008 introduced a \"100\" series of collations. You can find these collations by using the following queries: \nSELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations() WHERE [name] LIKE N'%[_]90[_]%'; -- 476\n\nSELECT * FROM sys.fn_helpcollations() WHERE [name] LIKE N'%[_]100[_]%'; -- 2686\n\nSince you are on SQL Server 2008 R2, you should use Latin1_General_100_CI_AS instead of Latin1_General_CI_AS.\nA difference between the case-sensitive versions of these particular collations (i.e. SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS and Latin1_General_100_CS_AS ) is in the order of upper-case and lower-case letters when doing case-sensitive sorting. This also affects single-character class ranges (i.e. [start-end]) that can be used with the LIKE operator and the PATINDEX function. The following three queries show this effect for both sorting and the character range.:\nSELECT tmp.col AS [Upper-case first]\nFROM (VALUES ('a'), ('A'), ('b'), ('B'), ('c'), ('C')) tmp(col)\nWHERE tmp.col LIKE '%[A-C]%' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS\nORDER BY tmp.col COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS; -- Upper-case first\n\nSELECT tmp.col AS [Lower-case first]\nFROM (VALUES ('a'), ('A'), ('b'), ('B'), ('c'), ('C')) tmp(col)\nWHERE tmp.col LIKE '%[A-C]%' COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CS_AS\nORDER BY tmp.col COLLATE Latin1_General_100_CS_AS; -- Lower-case first\n\nSELECT tmp.col AS [Lower-case first]\nFROM (VALUES (N'a'), (N'A'), (N'b'), (N'B'), (N'c'), (N'C')) tmp(col)\nWHERE tmp.col LIKE N'%[A-C]%' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS\nORDER BY tmp.col COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS; -- Lower-case first\n\nThe only way to get upper-case to sort before lower-case (for the same letter) is to use one of the 31 Collations that supports that behavior, which is the Hungarian_Technical_* Collations and a handful of SQL_ Collations (which only support this behavior for VARCHAR data).\nLess important for this particular change, but still good to know about since it would be impacting if changing the server to a binary or case-sensitive collation, is that the server level collation also affects:\n\nlocal variable names\nCURSOR names\nGOTO labels\nname resolution of the sysname datatype\n\nMeaning, if you or \"the programmer who left recently\" who is apparently responsible for all bad code ;-) were not careful about casing and declared a variable as @SomethingID but then referred to it as @somethingId later on, that would break if moving to a case-sensitive or binary collation. Similarly, code that uses the sysname datatype but refers to it as SYSNAME, SysName, or something other than all lower-case will also break if moved to an instance using a case-sensitive or binary collation.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain the implications of the increased credit default swaps for Tesla Inc's debt. Respond in 24 sentences.", "output": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The amount investors must pay to insure their debt holdings in Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) against declining credit quality rose on Monday to its second-highest price ever, implying the company is at a greater risk of default following a report that sparked concern that Tesla may need to raise funds.\nInsurance on Tesla’s debt, which is sold as a credit default swap contract, increased from Friday by 13 cents to $5.96 per $100 of Tesla debt. That followed a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday that Tesla had turned to some suppliers for a refund of previously made payments in a bid to make a profit, citing a memo sent by a Tesla global supply manager.\nA Tesla spokesperson said on Monday that the company had no comment on the credit default swaps, but said in a statement in response to the WSJ story that Tesla had asked fewer than 10 suppliers to reduce capital expenditure project spending. Tesla said that any changes with these suppliers would improve future cash flows but not affect its ability to achieve profitability in the third quarter.\nCompany founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk may be obligated to tap debt or equity markets again this year, according to analysts, though he has said he would do neither.\nThe market’s faith in Musk’s ability to raise cash if needed has kept Tesla’s implied risk of default lower than similarly rated junk bonds and has propped up the price of its debt, according to analysts.\nTesla’s junk bond coming due in 2025 88160RAE1= fell 1.75 cents to trade as low as 88.875 cents on the dollar, its biggest drop since Moody’s downgraded the company’s senior notes to Caa1 following production delays.\nIt cost $5.96 to insure $100 of Tesla’s debt, plus an upfront cost of around 18 percent, representing a total of 24.1 percent of the face value of the 2025 bond on Monday.\n“The CDS is saying that there are a lot of people betting this company is going out of business,” said Thomas Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.\nTesla has burned cash ramping up production of its Model 3 sedan, which prior to July, had fallen short of a series of targets.\nProfitability has been elusive for Tesla. There is over $11.5 billion of short interest on Tesla’s shares, the largest of such positions in the U.S. market by dollar value, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.\nA short position is a bet that a company’s shares will fall in price. Investors borrow shares in the hopes of selling them and then buying back shares at a lower price to repay the loan, allowing them to pocket the difference.\nAs a percentage of outstanding shares, Tesla’s short interest is 20.4 percent, which places it in the top 50 most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq.\nThe implied market probability of a default on Monday rose to 38.9 percent from 38.3 percent on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. The probability of a default was 34.19 percent when the credit-default swap contract TSLA5YUSAX=MG, the first and only referencing a Tesla bond, launched on June 27.\nCompared to Monday’s swoon in the bond price, the increased default probability seems low. That is explained, however, by the illiquid state of Tesla’s CDS, which have had only one trader, Edward Koo at JPMorgan (JPM.N), regularly offering quotes on the swap, according to Reuters trading sources who requested anonymity because the quotes are not public.\nBecause it has become harder to find third parties who are willing to take on credit risk via CDS since the financial crisis, market makers sometimes have to absorb that risk themselves. That raises CDS prices.\nBut the opportunity offered by Monday’s falling bond price saw a market maker added to the mix, with Goldman Sachs quoting an upfront price of 18 basis points to buy debt protection, and 16 to sell, according to Reuters trading sources with access to the quotes. JPMorgan’s quote was 23 points for buyers, versus 18 for sellers, up a point for both parties from last Wednesday’s quote.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Golf and grandchildren were on the agenda, she said — and not how a home-brew server crammed with classified information ended up in Bill Clinton’s basement.\nHowever, the attorney general normally doesn’t meet with family members of a target in an active FBI criminal investigation.\nHillary is just that — a target in an FBI criminal investigation.\nDownplaying the FBI criminal investigation is a deliberate communications strategy of the Clinton campaign. It’s a very bad sign that the person who must approve any grand-jury referral has adopted Hillary’s dishonest language.\nMany won’t believe Lynch and Clinton only discussed grandkids and golf in her cozy jet. But I do.\nThat’s all they needed to discuss for Bill to interfere with a criminal prosecution. Sophisticated insiders don’t need to use clumsy and explicit language. Merely having the tarmac meeting interferes with the investigation, even if golf and grandkids were the only topics discussed.\nThe tarmac summit sent a signal. It is a signal to all of the hardworking FBI agents who have the goods on Hillary. The attorney general has made it clear what team she is on. The attorney general isn’t on the side of justice. She’s on the Democratic Party team.\nThis is the unspoken message from Lynch to all of the FBI agents on the case and to all the front-line lawyers at the Justice Department: When you send your recommendation to refer Hillary’s case to the grand jury, you had better realize your burden to convince me I should sign off on a grand-jury request is higher than you thought. These are my friends.\nThis is standard operating procedure in the Obama Justice Department. When DOJ lawyers were reviewing South Carolina voter-ID laws for pre-clearance under the Voting Rights Act, then-Attorney General Eric Holder gave an interview and speech about the discriminatory nature of voter-ID laws. Like day follows night, the lawyers responsible for the review then blocked South Carolina’s law under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\nIt took South Carolina several million dollars in attorney fees to win a federal court case to gain approval — fees the state cannot recover.\nswarm of seasoned assistant United States attorneys?

The Justice Department has long had such a policy where proceedings are delayed until after an election — that’s so America doesn’t come to resemble a third-world nation that criminalizes politics.\nAt the same time, the American ideal says nobody is above the law — even Hillary.\nThat’s what separates the Anglo-America legal experience from every other legal culture in world history.\nThat it is no longer about a dalliance with a White House intern and instead involves national security makes the gangsterism all the more frightening.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Is Barack Obama a natural born US citizen?\n\nIn this Politico Article dated 8/5/10 the results of a poll taken on President Obama are discussed:\n\nThe poll of 1,018 adults shows 27\n  percent of Americans believe the\n  president was “probably” or\n  “definitely” born in another country,\n  compared with 71 percent who think he\n  was born in the United States.\n\nSo 1 in 4 Americans do not believe that President Obama is really a natural born citizen.  \nIs there any evidence to back up the Birther claims that Obama is not a natural born citizen?\n\nA:\n\nOne piece of evidence is the long-form birth certificate showing that Barack Obama was born in Honolulu on Hawaii:   (long-form on whitehouse.gov in PDF format)\n\nThe reissued short-form birth certificate:\n\nYou can find a detailed examination of the birth certificate on Factcheck.org. They conclude in their investigation\n\nFactCheck.org staffers have now seen,\n  touched, examined and photographed the\n  original birth certificate. We\n  conclude that it meets all of the\n  requirements from the State Department\n  for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims\n  that the document lacks a raised seal\n  or a signature are false. We have\n  posted high-resolution photographs of\n  the document as \"supporting documents\"\n  to this article. Our conclusion: Obama\n  was born in the U.S.A. just as he has\n  always said.\n\nThe director of Hawaii’s Department of Health, Chiyome Fukino, also confirmed that the certificate is genuine:\n\n\"I, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of\n  the Hawai'i State Department of\n  Health, have seen the original vital\n  records maintained on file by the\n  Hawai'i State Department of Health\n  verifying Barack Hussein Obama was\n  born in Hawai'i and is a natural-born\n  American citizen,\" Fukino said in a\n  statement. \"I have nothing further to\n  add to this statement or my original\n  statement issued in October 2008, over\n  eight months ago.\"\n  -- source\n\nThe Barack Obama birth announcement, published in The Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13, 1961:\n\nA:\n\nThere is a simple (legal) answer to this question, but it won't satisfy the conspiracy theorists.\n\nObama has released his birth certificate, and the State of Hawaii confirms that it is real. op cit - previous answers\nArticle 4 of the US Constitution states, in part, \n\nFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. emphasis  mine\n\nWhat this means, is that Barack Obama is a natural born citizen solely for the reason that Hawaii says he is.  No other argument is necessary or required.  The only way to counter this argument is to have Hawaii repeal the certificate.\nI realize that this doesn't answer the implied question \"Where was Barack Obama really born?\"  But it does shoot a hole into any Arizona laws intending to keep Obama off the ballot.  If Hawaii says he's eligible, then Arizona has to respect that.  ", "output": "While the constitution does state that to be president, one must be a \"natural born citizen\", it in NO WAY defines what that term means.  So we are left with something of a legal void.\nThere is the Part of the U.S. Code that address this.  His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, being born in Kansas, was a natural born citizen (I don't believe there is any question on that point). \nSection (e) of the code above stats:\n\n(e) a person born in an outlying possession of the United States of parents one of whom is a citizen of the United States who has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year at any time prior to the birth of such person; \n\nSo, regardless of where he was born (Hawaii or Kenya as some have claimed but provided little if any evidence), he is a citizen.\nHowever, the U.S. Title only states that \"The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth\", and does not use the phrase \"natural born\".\nThere is no final, legal definition even today on what \"Natural Born Citizen\" means, according to legal professor Gabriel \"Jack\" Chin:\n\nUnfortunately, the text of the\n  Constitution does not define natural\n  born citizenship, and neither the\n  Supreme Court nor Congress has weighed\n  in on the question.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Story: The Brighton police were baffled. And, I must admit, it was a troublesome case. Fortunately, I was taking my August fortnight holiday in Brighton and happened to be on the scene. I presented my official card to Inspector Malmson of the Brighton Constabulary. “Chief Inspector Lestrade, Scotland Yard,” he read. “This is indeed an honor, sir. What luck, having you here! Would you please assist us with the investigation? A titled guest has had her necklace stolen!” I looked at him sharply. He adjusted his request: “I mean, Chief Inspector, would you please take over the investigation? We stand ready of course to assist you in any way.” He, of course, breathed a sigh of relief when I agreed. I must say that the previous week here at the Palace Hotel had been rather boring. I am not a sea bather by inclination, and the sun rather gives me burns and rashes rather than pleasure. Frankly, I missed the caseload back in London where I was occasionally matching wits with that consulting detective fellow, Sherlock Holmes. Well, here in Brighton, I wouldn’t have that competition looking over my shoulder. “When was the necklace taken, and whom have you interviewed?” “Countess Mannerley told the hotel management of this less than an hour ago.” The hotel manager, Nathan Larksley, nodded, “Yes, Chief Inspector. She said that she had put the triple strand pearl necklace on, and last saw it by the light of the gas lamps in the Palm Court’s grand mirror as she entered the ballroom, half an hour earlier. When next she looked, the necklace was gone! Before she could tell us anything more, the poor lady fainted, right in front of the mirror, where we were speaking. It caused a dreadful commotion. I did, however, think to close the ballroom before calling the Brighton Constabulary. Nobody has left.” “You did well indeed, Mr. Larksley. We will now take statements, so that your guests will be inconvenienced as little as possible. Inspector Malmson, I assume the room has been closed, and that you will now search the premises for the necklace.” “Very good, Chief Inspector.” Malmson was glad to have an order to obey, and Larksley was clearly relieved that I had not yet ordered the guests to be searched. I then briefly addressed the 50 or so people who were now seated at tables in the Palm Court. Their statements were taken and signed. It was a closed seasonal party, which meant that only those actually staying at the hotel were invited. That reduced the numbers of horses and carriages that would usually crowd the entrance to the hotel. I told everyone that they were not at liberty to leave the hotel without my express permission. Everyone cooperated with a minimum of fuss, which delighted Mr. Larksley. I read all of the statements, most of which checked out, giving credible alibis to the partners of those giving the statements. Then I decided to talk with four persons personally, without witnesses. Mr. Larksley ushered Countess Mannerley in. “Sit down, Countess,” I began, “I gather it isn’t still ‘Lightfinger Sue!’” She looked at me with a wild expression. Denials were useless. “How did you know? Well you would, wouldn’t you! Don’t give me away, Chief Inspector. For 10 years I’ve been straight, and the title, from my late husband, who passed away last year, is quite genuine. Best man I ever knew. He gave me a second chance, and that pearl necklace too. If only I’d had that clasp fixed! By the way, they were the real thing -- and I haven’t insured them! I’d always left that sort of thing up to my husband. But it turns out that he didn’t have a practical turn of mind.” She started sobbing all over again. “Sue -- I mean Countess -- you can help me with one detail. Did you recognize anyone from the old days here tonight? Someone who, like yourself, had a past best hidden?” She shook her head, “Yes, it’s Archie Hopkins, who is using his full given name, Archibald. He was a fence in London, just this side of the law. I think you’ll find, Chief Inspector, that there’s a great deal of information that Scotland Yard got from Archie over the years. He was shady, but never quite illegal.” I nodded in agreement. I had heard of Archie Hopkins, now that she mentioned him. “Anyone else?” She considered the matter carefully. “No,” she answered. “What exactly did you do after you entered the Palm Court?” “Well, after entering, I had a glass of champagne with Loralie Courtney, that nice young lady from the Midlands. Then Archie came up and said hello, with rather a pursed look. I took it that meant that I wasn’t to let on that we knew each other from the old days, which was fine with me, I can tell you! We had a dance together for old times sake. Then the music stopped, and he introduced his friend Robert to me. I didn’t quite catch the surname, he was that good looking.” I looked through the statements. There were three Roberts. “Sir Robert Causewell?” I asked. “No. He was playing whist at the card table.” “Robert Coverley?” “Doesn’t ring a bell, I’m afraid.” “Robert Bannington?” “Yes, that’s it. Fine man. I enjoyed meeting him, even though he spent most of our dance looking over my shoulder at another lady.” “Then what happened?” “It was time to powder my nose, so I took my leave of Bannington, then noticed in the grand mirror that my pearls were missing. I fainted, and came to not long ago.” I thanked her for her cooperation, and sent for Robert Bannington. He entered the room, closing the door behind him. “‘Quicksilver Bob,’ isn’t it?” He turned white. “That’s in the past. I haven’t lifted anything in years.” “Tell me what happened tonight.” “Well, Archibald Hopkins introduced me to the Countess. The music was playing, so we had a dance. She’s quite charming, really, but I wanted to meet another lady, so I doubt that I was very diverting. Though, the Countess is a divine dancer. Her turns were exquisitely done. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that she had been in the ballet. So many of the ladies one meets do have that background, you know, ballet or opera.” I nodded, prying for more details with my questioning stare. “I wish the others on the floor had been as graceful. That fat elderly Indian Army colonel and his equally fat wife were so graceless that as the music tempo picked up, they actually ran into the Countess, turning her around for a moment -- it was all I could do to keep her from falling. But she laughed about it afterwards. She told me that she hadn’t had such a diversion since she had lost her poor husband.” “Had you noticed her pearls?” I asked. “Of course, Chief Inspector. I thought, with that loose clasp, that they might fall and scatter all over the floor!” I thanked him, and sent for Archibald Hopkins. “You are well known to us at Scotland Yard, Mr. Hopkins -- and not unfavorably,” I said. “I’ve always tried to be helpful,” he said gruffly. “Tell me about your meeting tonight with Countess Mannerley.” “It wasn’t a meeting. This was a social occasion. We just had a brief dance. That was it.” “A brief dance, you say? Why brief? She was certainly one of the most attractive ladies in the Palm Court.” “It’s my gout -- my foot hurts like blazes whenever I exercise. Why, the physicians have even ordered me to cut back on port wine -- so that my big toe doesn’t get further inflamed.” I then called for Loralie Courtney. “Of course I saw her pearls, Chief Inspector,” she said, “Every woman in the room did. Countess Mannerley and I were talking about them over a glass of champagne, and when old Archibald Hopkins came over, we were still talking about them.” I sat for a moment, a glass of port wine in hand, considering what I had seen and heard. Inspector Malmson dashed over, very excited. “We’ve found the pearls, sir. They were dropped into one of the palm tree pots decorating the room, to be picked up later, no doubt. Until we looked closely, they were well hidden by the lush lower fronds or branches of the tree itself.” I could not suppress a smile. I gave instructions to Inspector Malmson for an arrest to be made. Handled with discretion, the guests might think this had all been holiday entertainment, provided for their amusement. That would please Mr. Larksley. And this time Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t be there to take credit for my case! Who stole the pearls?", "output": "Countess Mannerley admitted that her pearls were real, and that they were not insured. She could not profit from their being stolen, and couldn’t file an insurance claim.\n\nLoralie Courtney naturally talked about the pearls with Countess Mannerley. The conversation continued when Hopkins joined them, as it would not have done if the pearls were then missing.\n\nArchibald Hopkins suffers from painful gout, which restricted his physical activity, and makes him an unlikely thief. He is used to operating just this side of the law, but within it. He might, however, be helpful as a source of information regarding the real thief.\n\nRobert Bannington observed the necklace, and paid close attention to the clasp. He also kept looking over her shoulder, not to find another dance partner, as Countess Mannerley thought, but to see how the clasp on her pearls worked.\n\nThe clumsy Indian Army Colonel and his wife, who lurched into Bannington and the Countess on the dance floor, gave Bannington his chance to steal the pearls when the Countess was spun around, her back to him. The faulty clasp, which Bannington admits to studying, made it child’s play for an experienced thief. He hid the pearls under the foliage of the nearest potted palm tree when the police sealed off the room.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "How is SpaceX attempting to reduce the cost of launching rockets?", "output": "SpaceX is all about reducing the cost of launching things into space, and right now one of those costs it think it can eliminate is having to use a new fairing every time it launches a rocket. The fairing is basically the shell at the top of the rocket that protects whatever cargo’s being launched (for instance, it housed the Tesla Roadster and SpaceX’s Starman mannequin during the recent Falcon Heavy test launch).\nThe fairing costs $6 million to produce, and so reusing it for multiple costs could lead to a significantly reduction in how much each launch individually costs SpaceX. SpaceX recovered a nose cone last year during a launch, but it has a new plan for fairing retrieval that should make it more repeatable and reliable to get these things back.\nEnter “Mr. Steven,” essentially a large navigable platform ship, with extended ‘arms’ and a net strung between them.

The estimated cost of the Falcon 9 launch is currently at around $63 million, assuming total expendable configuration, so cutting a potential $6 million from that total, on top of reusable booster benefits, could be significant.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "How does frame stiffness affect a quadcopter?\n\nWhen choosing a frame for a drone, something I hear mentioned occasionally is how flexible the carbon fiber is. It seems that the general opinion is: more flex in a frame is worse. How would having a frame with flex in it be bad for a high-powered quadcopter? Would it impact the efficiency and performance of the quadcopter?\n\nA:\n\nBackground\nStiffness, oscillation, and vibration damping are separate concepts but all somewhat relevant to the question. Each affects flight dynamics, and each is (somewhat) a function of material choice. \nFor example, titanium is very stiff, and it rings like a bell. CF is very stiff, but it rings like mud. Aluminum is in between.\nStiffness\nStiffness is a good thing when you don't want your structure to be compliant[*]. Stiffness means that the frame isn't deflecting, which is important for the presumed laws of motion. Put another way, a quadcopter's autopilot assumes that all the motors are pointed in a fixed direction[**]. If those directions change, i.e. because of flexing, then the most fundamental assumptions of its flight dynamics are false. It's no surprise flight flight performance degrades!\nOf course, any structure will bend/deflect/twist under load, no matter how stiff. What's important is whether it does any of these sufficiently enough to compromise your flight goal. If you're trying to do telescopic videography then a little bit of error is immediately visible in the results. If you're learning to fly, then so long as the autopilot keeps things sunny-side up you're fine.\nOscillation\nOscillation, such as control-surface flutter, occur when the  entire structure starts deforming like a spring. This can dramatically build up and quickly rip the airframe to shreds. (It really is that fast, that violent, and that scary.)\nIf a quad's arms are insufficiently damped, oscillations can occur. Most frequently, it will occur as a twist about the arm axis, but I've also seen it happen in the flapping direction. Because of differences in dynamics between a multirotor and a fixed-wing, it's unlikely that your quad will suffer inflight failure but it's also very hard to keep control, both for you and the autopilot. \nThe closer you get to instability, the more energy you have to expend to keep things stable. In the case of a multi, at the very least this translates into decreased flight time.\nThe more powerful your input (e.g. a powerful quadcopter), the easier it is to drive a system past a critical damping threshold. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was famous for this when the wind  was blowing and the bridge was slightly wet. More recently, these out of control harmonic oscillations have famously been seen on the Millennium Bridge in London (surprisingly due to human footfall) and the Humen Perl River Bridge in China (heavy winds).\nA full discussion of how to control oscillation is outside the scope of this answer. However, it is relevant to note that some materials are springier than others, and these materials are the ones more likely to have pathological  oscillation.\nVibration\nVibration is a form of oscillation, but I'm breaking it out so I can specifically address how it affects sensor data. Vibration is an issue when it causes signal integrity issues with the IMU (i.e. accelerometer + gyrometer)[***]. This can confuse the autopilot, leading it to make incorrect estimations of the aircraft's roll-pitch-yaw, and as a result respond inappropriately. This can and does cause crashes.\nAgain, a full discussion of how to control vibration is outside the scope of this answer. And once again, the springier the material is, the more it is likely to have pathological vibration.\nComposites vs. metals\nComposites (e.g. carbon fiber, fiberglass, kevlar, ...) have what are called anisotropic properties. This means that they don't have the same properties in all directions. Consider a square sheet of aluminum. No matter which axis you pull it on, it has the same strength, stiffness, heat transfer, etc... This is isotropic.\nNow consider the same sheet made out of unidirectional carbon fiber. Along the carbon fiber axis it's incredibly strong. But turned 90 degrees, where the only thing holding it together is the glue, you'll find that it has no strength whatsoever.\nYou would be correct in assuming that this difference in properties extends to oscillation and vibration. The upshot is that composites can be tricky to chose because two seemingly similar structures (e.g. a tube) can have very different properties. \n\n[*] Able to move and bend, like the Goshawk.\n\n[**] See math in https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/323/46.\n\n[***] For example, aliasing and clipping.", "output": "TL;DR:\nYes, a semi-rigid frame will cause vibrations while flying because it alters the nature of motor and propeller oscillations as the frame parts move around. This will cause a drop in efficency as the flight controller attempts to combat these vibrations and return to stable flight, using slightly more power in the process.\nExcessive vibrations in parts of the frame caused by semi-flexible pieces and or unsecured electronics parts can also cause damage to the frame and electrical components and increases the risk of accidents where the quad falls apart prematurely or drops out of the air.\nMore Details\nStrictly speaking, any energy that goes into contorting the frame is energy that didn't go into accelerating/decelerating the quad, which is to say that bending the frame inflight will decrease the efficency of the whole system. This is also true about the thrust force vector, which will deviate slightly from vertical when the frame is bent, decreasing efficency. These losses would usually be very tiny and almost negligible because the amount of bending possible on most commercially available frames is miniscule. If these kinds of losses are a problem on your quadcopter, you need to address them before you fly because they will likely cause your quad to fall out of the sky and or cause damage to itself.\nHowever, there are other issues with frames that allow parts to flex freely. Semi-rigid frames will move with the motor and propeller vibrations and bend when motor thrust changes, causing even more trouble for the flight controller and can impact flight performance. This can be another source of efficency loss as the flight controller tries to compensate for oscillations that are caused by parts of the frame vibrating uncontrollably. This is why it's always recommended to fully tighten screws and make sure all parts are carefully secured to the frame before flight.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "The synonym of trope is defined as metaphor, but there seem to be some other implications when using the word trope that metaphor does not have. Can anyone explain this simply and sensibly?.", "output": "The word trope has shot to prominence in the last couple of decades... And as this article points out, 'Trope is the New Meme', which I read in two ways. Use of the word itself has become a meme (pattern of behavior that spreads throughout a culture). But also, the meaning of the word has shifted for many people. To quote from that article... trope has to do with an agreed-upon narrative, an archetypal reading of a story or situation according to the simplest and most widely-held beliefs, a kind of narrative stereotype. Or, as the excellent site tvtropes puts it... tropes are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations. I actually studied literature over 40 years ago, but I can't say I remember us using the word in the 'typical' dictionary sense as given by OED... A figure of speech which consists in the use of a word or phrase in a sense other than that which is proper to it; also, in casual use, a figure of speech; figurative language. So far as I'm concerned, if someone wants to use it like that, I'm not going to argue with them or their dictionaries. But most current usages are more in line with my first two definitions above. Here's how tvtropes knits the two definitions together... Merriam-Webster gives a definition of 'trope' as a 'figure of speech.' In storytelling, a trope is just that a conceptual figure of speech, a storytelling shorthand for a concept that the audience will recognize and understand instantly.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Explain the U.S. currency system, including the denominations of currency in circulation and any denominations that are no longer printed.", "output": "What denominations of currency are in circulation today? Will any new denominations be produced?\nThe present denominations of our currency in production are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today.\nWhat denominations of currency notes is the Treasury Department no longer printing?\nOn July 14, 1969, David M. Kennedy, the 60th Secretary of the Treasury, and officials at the Federal Reserve Board announced that they would immediately stop distributing currency in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. Production of these denominations stopped during World War II. Their main purpose was for bank transfer payments. With the arrival of more secure transfer technologies, however, they were no longer needed for that purpose. While these notes are legal tender and may still be found in circulation today, the Federal Reserve Banks remove them from circulation and destroy them as they are received.\nDid the Treasury Department ever produce a $1 million currency note? I have one that I want to know about.\nWe receive many inquiries asking if the Treasury Department ever produced a $1 million currency note. People have sent in copies of these notes. We have found that they are nonnegotiable platinum certificates known as a \"One Million Dollar Special Issue.\" These notes were from a special limited copyrighted art series originally sold by a Canadian firm for $1.00 each as a collectible item. They are not official United States currency notes manufactured by our Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). As such, they are not redeemable by the Department of the Treasury.\nYou may be interested to know that the BEP learned of these certificates in the spring of 1982. All related correspondence was forwarded to the United States Secret Service to decide if there were any violations of Federal currency laws. The Secret Service subsequently advised, however, that these certificates did not violate any United States law.\nWhy did the Treasury Department remove the $2 bill from circulation?\nThe $2 bill has not been removed from circulation and is still a circulating denomination of United States paper currency. The Federal Reserve System does not, however, request the printing of that denomination as often as the others. The Series 2003 $2 bill was the last printed and bears the names of former Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snow and Treasurer Rosario Marin. As of April 30, 2007 there were $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.\nThe key for successfully circulating the $2 bill is for retailers to use them just like any other denomination in their daily operations. In addition, most commercial banks will readily supply their retail customers with these bills if their customers request them in sufficient volume to justify stocking them in their vaults. However, neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System can force the distribution or use of any denomination of currency on banks, businesses or individuals.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What is the most efficient way to recognize hiv symptoms? Could you provide a list of 15 steps?", "output": "1. Determine if you are experiencing acute fatigue with no explainable cause.: Fatigue can be the sign of many different illnesses, but it's a symptom experienced by many people with HIV. This symptom shouldn't cause great alarm if it's the only one you're feeling, but it's something to look into further.\n\nAcute fatigue isn't the same as simply feeling sleepy. Do you feel tired all the time, even after a good night's sleep? Do you find yourself taking more afternoon naps than usual, and avoiding strenuous activities because you feel low energy? This type of fatigue is cause for concern.\nIf this symptom persists over a few weeks or months, be sure to get tested to rule out HIV.\n2. Be on the lookout for a fever or excessive night sweats.: These symptoms commonly occur during the early stages of an HIV infection, during what is called the primary or acute HIV infection stage. Again, many people don't have these symptoms, but those who do usually experience them 2-4 weeks after contracting HIV.\n\nFever and night sweats are also symptoms of the flu and the common cold. If it's flu or cold season, that might be what you're experiencing.\n\nChills, muscle aches, sore throat, and headache, which are also symptoms of the flu and cold, can also be signs of an early HIV infection.\n3. Check for swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groin.: The lymph nodes swell in reaction to bodily infections. This doesn't happen to everyone who has primary HIV, but among those who have symptoms, it's a common one.\n\nThe lymph nodes in the neck tend to swell more than those in the armpits or groin with an HIV infection.\nLymph nodes can swell as a result of many other types of infections, such as a cold or the flu, so further investigation is necessary to determine the cause.\n4. Note instances of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.: These symptoms, which are commonly associated with the flu, can also indicate an early HIV infection. Get tested if these symptoms persist.\n5. Pay attention to mouth and genital ulcers.: If you see a mouth ulcer appear along with the other symptoms noted, especially if you don't commonly get mouth ulcers, it may be a sign of primary HIV infection. Genital ulcers are also an indication that HIV may be present.\n6. Don't dismiss a dry cough.: This symptom occurs in the later stages of HIV, sometimes many years after the virus has been contracted and been latent in the body. This seemingly innocuous symptom is easy to ignore at first, especially if it occurs during allergy season or during cough and cold season. If you have a dry cough you just can't seem to kick by taking allergy medications or using an inhaler, it may be a symptom of HIV.\n7. Look into irregular spots (red, brown, pink, or purplish in color) on the skin.: People in the later stages of HIV often get rashes on their skin, especially on the face and torso.  These can also be present on the inside of the mouth and nose. It's a sign that the HIV is developing into AIDS.\n\nFlaky, red skin is also a sign of later stage HIV. The spots may also look like boils or bumps.\nA skin rash usually doesn't accompany the flu or a cold, so if you have one at the same time as other symptoms, see a doctor right away.\n8. Pay attention if you get pneumonia.: Pneumonia often affects people whose immune systems aren't working properly. People with later-stage HIV are prone to getting pneumonia from a germ that wouldn't normally cause such a severe reaction.\n9. Check for yeast infections, especially in the mouth.: Later-stage HIV patients commonly get a yeast infection in the mouth, called thrush. The condition looks like white spots or other unusual spots on the tongue and inside of the mouth. This is a warning sign that the immune system isn't effectively fighting off infection.\n10. Examine your nails for signs of fungus.: Nails that are yellow or brown, and that are cracked or chipped, are common among later-stage HIV patients. The nails become more susceptible to fungus, which the body is able to fight off under normal conditions.\n11. Determine whether you're experiencing rapid weight loss with no known cause.: In the early stages of HIV, this could be caused by excessive diarrhea; in later stages, it's known as \"wasting,\" and is a strong bodily reaction to the presence of HIV in the system.\n12. Be aware of neurological issues.: These could include memory loss, depression, or other neurological afflictions. HIV affects the cognitive function of the brain in later stages. These symptoms are serious and should be looked into no matter what.\n13. Know if you are at risk.: There are several different circumstances that can place you at risk of contracting HIV. If you've experienced one of the following situations, you are at risk:\n\nYou've had unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\nYou've shared needles or syringes.\nYou've been diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD), tuberculosis, or hepatitis.\nYou received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985, the years before safety precautions were in place to prevent tainted blood from being used in transfusions.\n14. Get tested: This is the most accurate measure in determining if you have HIV. Contact a local health clinic, the Red Cross, your doctor's office, or another local resource to find out where to get tested. Go to the website aids.gov for a listing of testing locations.\n\nTesting is easy, affordable, and reliable (in the majority of cases). The most common test is done through drawing a blood sample. There are also tests that use oral fluids (collected with a swab) or urine. There are even tests you can take at home. If you do not have a regular physician who can provide testing, contact your local Health Department.\nIf you are tested for HIV, do not let fear prevent you from obtaining your test results. Knowing whether or not you are infected will give you the best chance to treat your condition, or to change your lifestyle to prevent an infection.\nMany health organizations recommend getting tested as part of your routine physical, even if you don’t think you are at risk. Catching and treating HIV early can help prevent later complications.\n15. Don't wait for symptoms to occur to get tested.: Many people with HIV don't know they have it. The virus can be carried in your body for over ten years before symptoms begin to occur. If you have reason to think you may have contracted HIV, don't let a lack of symptoms stop you from getting tested. It's best to know as soon as possible.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "What are some steps to make lots of money in online stock trading?", "output": "Investing in the stock market can be a great way to have your money make money, particularly in today’s economic climate where savings accounts and long-term bank notes do not offer significant returns. Stock trading is not a risk-free activity, and some losses are inevitable.  However, with substantial research and investments in the right companies, stock trading can potentially be very profitable.\n1. Research current trends.: There are many reputable sources that report on market trends. You may want to subscribe to a stock-trading magazine such as Kiplinger, Investor's Business Daily, Traders World, The Economist, or Bloomberg BusinessWeek. .\nYou could also follow blogs written by successful market analysts such as Abnormal Returns, Deal Book, Footnoted, Calculated Risk, or Zero Hedge.\n2. Select a trading website.: Some of the top-rated sites include Scottrade, OptionsHouse, TD Ameritrade, Motif Investing and TradeKing. Be sure that you are aware of any transaction fees or percentages that will be charged before you decide on a site to use. \n\nBe sure the service you use is reputable. You might want to read reviews of the business online.\nSelect a service that has amenities such as a mobile phone app, investor education and research tools, low transaction fees, easy to read data and 24/7 customer service.\n3. Create an account with one or more trading websites.: You’re unlikely to need more than one, but you may want to start with two or more so that you can later narrow your choice to the site you like the best.\n\nBe sure to check out the minimum balance requirements for each site. Your budget may only allow you to create accounts on one or two sites.\nStarting with a particularly small amount, like $1,000, may limit you to certain trading platforms, as others have higher minimum balances.\n4. Practice trading before you put real money in.: Some websites such as ScottradeELITE, SureTrader, and OptionsHouse offer a virtual trading platform, where you can experiment for a while to assess your instincts without putting actual money in. Of course, you can’t make money this way, but you also can’t lose money!\nTrading in this manner will get you used to the methods and types of decisions you will be faced with when trading but overall is a poor representation of actual trading. In real trading, there will be a delay when buying and selling stocks, which may result in different prices than you were aiming for. Additionally, trading with virtual money will not prepare you for the stress of trading with your real money.\n5. Choose reliable stocks.: You have a lot of choices, but ultimately you want to buy stock from companies that dominate their niche, offer something that people consistently want, have a recognizable brand, and have a good business model and a long history of success.\n\nLook into a company's public financial reports to evaluate how profitable they are. A more profitable company usually means a more profitable stock. You can find complete financial information about any publicly traded company by visiting their website and locating their most recent annual report. If it is not on the site you can call the company and request a hard copy.\n\nLook at the company's worst quarter on record and decide if the risk of repeating that quarter is worth the potential for profit.\n\nResearch the company's leadership, operating costs, and debt. Analyze their balance sheet and income statement and determine if they are profitable or have a good chance to be in the future.\n\nCompare the stock history of a specific company to the performance of its peer companies. If all technology stocks were down at one point, evaluating them relative to each other rather than to the entire market can tell you which company has been on top of its industry consistently.\n\nListen to a company's earnings conference calls. First, analyze the company's quarterly earnings release that is posted online as a press release about an hour before the call.\n6. Buy your first stocks.: When you are ready, take the plunge and buy a small number of reliable stocks. The exact number will depend on your budget, but shoot for at least two. Companies that are well-known and have established trading histories and good reputations are generally the most stable stocks and a good place to start. Begin trading small and use an amount of cash you are prepared to lose.\nIt is reasonable for an investor to begin trading with as little as $1,000. You just have to be careful to avoid large transaction fees, as these can easily eat up your gains when you have a small account balance.\n7. Invest mostly in mid-cap and large-cap companies.: Mid-cap companies are those that have a market capitalization between two and $10 billion. Large-cap companies have market caps larger than $10 billion, while those with market caps smaller than $2 billion are small-caps.\nMarket capitalization is calculated by multiplying a company’s stock price by the number of shares outstanding.\n8. Monitor the markets daily.: Remember the cardinal rule in stock trading is to buy low and sell high. If your stock value has increased significantly, you may want to evaluate whether you should sell the stock and reinvest the profits in other (lower priced) stocks.\n9. Consider investing in mutual funds.: Mutual funds are actively managed by a professional fund manager and include a combination of stocks. These will be diversified with investments in such sectors as technology, retail, financial, energy or foreign companies.\n10. Buy low.: This means that when stocks are at a relatively low price based on past history, you buy them. Of course, no one knows for sure when the prices are going to go up or down—that’s the challenge in stock investing.\nTo determine if a stock is undervalued, look at the company's earnings per share as well as purchasing activity by company employees. Look for companies in particular industries and markets where there's lots of volatility, as that's where you can make a lot of money.\n11. Sell high.: You want to sell your stocks at their peak based on past history. If you sell the stocks for more money than you bought them for, you make money. The bigger the increase from when you bought them to when you sold them, the more money you make.\n12. Do not sell in a panic.: When a stock you have drops lower than the price you bought it for, your instinct may be to get rid of it. While there is a possibility that it can keep falling and never come back up, you should consider the possibility that it may rebound. Selling for a loss isn’t always the best idea, because you lock in your loss.\n13. Study the fundamental and technical market analysis methods.: These are the two basic models of understanding the stock market and anticipating price changes. The model you use will determine how you make decisions about what stocks to buy and when to buy and sell them.\n\nA fundamental analysis makes decisions about a company based on what they do, their character and reputation, and who leads the company. This analysis seeks to give an actual value to the company and, by extension, the stock.\nA technical analysis looks at the entire market and what motivates investors to buy and sell stocks. This involves looking at trends and analyzing investor reactions to events.\n\nMany investors use a combination of these two methods to make informed investment decisions.\n14. Consider investing in companies that pay dividends.: Some investors, known as income investors, prefer to invest almost entirely in dividend-paying stocks. This is a way that your stock holdings can make money even if they don't appreciate the price. Dividends are company profits paid directly to stockholders quarterly. Whether or not you decide to invest in these stocks will depend entirely on your personal goals as an investor.\n15. Diversify your holdings.: Once you have established some stock holdings, and you have a handle on how the buying and selling works, you should diversify your stock portfolio. This means that you should put your money in a variety of different stocks.\n\nTo diversify your stock portfolio, consider investing in index funds like the S&P 500, these funds have a list of 500 companies and is safer than investing in individual stocks.\nStart-up companies might be a good choice after you have a base of older-company stock established. If a startup is bought by a bigger company, you could potentially make a lot of money very quickly. However, be aware that 90% of startup companies last fewer than 5 years, which makes them risky investments.\n\nConsider looking into different industries as well. If your original holdings are mostly in technology companies, try looking into manufacturing or retail. This will diversify your portfolio against negative industry trends.\n16. Reinvest your money.: When you sell your stock (hopefully for a lot more than you bought it for), you should roll your money and profits into buying new stocks. If you can make a little money every day or every week, you’re on your way to stock market success.\nConsider putting a portion of your profits into a savings or retirement account.\n17. Invest in an IPO (initial public offering).: An IPO is the first time a company issues stock. This can be a great time to buy stock in a company you believe will be successful, as the IPO offering price often (but not always) turns out to be the lowest price ever for a company’s stock.\n18. Take calculated risks when selecting stocks.: The only way to make a lot of money in the stock market is to take risks and get a little bit lucky. This does not mean you should stake everything on risky investments and hope for the best, though. Investing should not be played the same way as gambling. You should research every investment thoroughly and be sure that you can recover financially if your trade goes poorly.\n\nOn one hand, playing it safe with only established stocks will not normally allow you to \"beat the market\" and gain very high returns. However, those stocks tend to be stable, which means you have a lower chance of losing money. And with steady dividend payments and accounting for risk, these companies can end up being a much better investment than riskier companies.\nYou can also reduce your risk by hedging against losses on your investments. See how to hedge in investments for more information.\n19. Beware of the downside of day trading.: Brokerage firms will usually charge fees for every transaction that can really add up. If you make more than a certain amount of trades per week, the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) forces you to set up at institutional account with a high minimum balance. Day trading is known for losing people lots of money as well as being stressful, so it is usually better to invest over a long period of time.\n20. Talk to a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).: Once you start making serious money in the stock market, you may want to talk to an accountant about how your profits will be taxed. That said, while it's always best to talk to a tax professional, in many cases you will be able to adequately research this information for yourself and avoid paying a professional.\n21. Know when to get out.: Trading in the stock market is like legal gambling and not an honest investment in the long term period. This is where it is different than investing, which is longer-term and safer. Some people can develop an unhealthy obsession with trading, which can lead you to lose a lot (even all) of your money. If you feel like you're losing control of your ability to make rational choices about investing your money, try to find help before you lose everything. If you know a professional who is smart, rational, objective, and unemotional, ask that person for help if you feel out of control.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
{"input": "Is self-answering questions by linking to your own company website allowed?\n\nA user has recently answered 2 of his questions by writing about the CI-software he sells and linking to his company website. One answer contains a disclaimer that he is the owner, the other answer does not. In his defence, the second answer is a bit less promotional and only links to a blog on the company website.\n\nanswer with disclaimer: https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/300 \nanswer with no disclaimer: https://devops.stackexchange.com/a/301\n\nPersonally I consider the first answer to be a form of spam, despite the disclaimer. The second answer I'm not so sure of. \nWhat do other people think of this? Is this a form of spam or is this allowed?\n\nA:\n\nWell, if we go by the Stack Exchange definition of spam, neither of them qualify (and spam flags on those posts would likely be declined):\n\nSpam is an unsolicited commercial advertisement. We've all seen it, and we all know what it looks like. It looks like the same stuff you see in your spam folder when you look at your email.\n\nBecause each post flagged as spam comes with a -100 reputation penalty, and the risk of users being fed into the spam blocking systems, these should generally not be flagged as spam.\nHowever, there is a different issue at hand: self promotion. The help center has a good section on this I'll quote:\n\nAvoid overt self-promotion.\nThe community tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.\nIf a large percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details. We also offer free community promotion ads for open source projects and non-profit organizations.\n\nThat captures it really well in my opinion—if you're clearly just here to try and sell your product, then you're not here for the right reasons, but if you genuinely think your product could solve a problem, it's fine to share it in a small percentage of your posts.\nI would say the most balanced approach would be to vote on the posts based on how useful you find them—if you think it's unhelpful, vote down, although using a custom flag to explain that you think the promotion is inappropriate would also be acceptable generally.\nAdmittedly, a self-answer does raise some suspicion, but I'd personally give people the benefit of the doubt at this stage—it's easy to get caught on the wrong side of self-promotion rules, and if the intention was good, I wouldn't object.\n\nWhat I think would make a better answer is something along these lines:\n\nQ: How do I solve foo?\nA: I wanted to solve this, so I investigated these approaches:\n\nBar\nBaz\n\nBaz works particularly well because _______. I developed this idea into a product ([insert relevant link here]) which may be helpful.\n\nThis way, you're teaching everyone else how to solve problems while still giving them a pre-made solution and a link to your project. Sharing your relevant experiences and solutions while developing the product would be fascinating.

{"input": "Story: One night when his little nephew and niece were too excited to sleep, Uncle Robert told them a story about a past adventure he’d encountered on the police force. He hoped that a mystery might tire them out enough to send them off to sleep. And so he gathered the children around the fire and began this story. “Back when I was a detective I once found myself in a very strange situation. We had arrested a spy in central London and knew that he was on his way to a restaurant where he would be passed a small microchip containing a lot of information via a contact masquerading as a chef.” “What do you mean, Uncle Robert?” his small nephew, Peter, asked. “A spy was to receive a special microchip from a chef. … A chef, that is, who was not really a chef. “Who was he then?” “He was a secret contact.” “Oh, a secret contact! Hmm, was he one of the good guys or one of the bad guys?” his nephew inquired. “He was one of the bad guys … working with the spy.” “Stop interrupting, and let him tell the story!” little Jane said, pointing at Peter. Uncle Robert smiled, continuing: “We knew the description that the chef had been given, and we also knew that the spy was to receive the microchip concealed in a dish ordered from the menu. It turned out that the spy’s description commented on a few physical particulars, all of which I happened to match. Since we knew the table number booked in the spy’s name, it occurred to us that I should go along to the restaurant, assuming the identity of the spy – and intercept the microchip!” “Why didn’t you just go in and arrest everyone?” Peter asked. “Well, we would have,” Uncle Robert replied, “but there was a chance that the contact would have destroyed the chip! And without the chip, there would have been no way to prove anything.” “Exactly! I could have guessed that!” Jane chimed in. “What happened in the restaurant, Uncle Robert? Tell us, tell us!” Peter said anxiously, fidgeting with his pajama sleeves. “Well, I made my way to the restaurant, which was a fancy place in Mayfair called, Foie Paux. This place had vibrant and bright décor. And in the center of the large, main room was a square enclosure where four chefs were preparing their specialty dishes. As I watched, a smartly dressed waitress cleared up the used round of red plates from the central serving area, while a waiter deposited a fresh stack of blue dishes.” “I would prefer the blue dishes if I ate there,” Billy said. Jane rolled her eyes, and crinkled her small forehead, annoyed with her little brother. She nodded at Uncle Robert, insisting that he continue. “I was surprised to find that the table had not been booked for a specific time. The spy had only stated that he would turn up at some point during the evening, and that he wished to occupy the table for 30 minutes. Thankfully, before my cover was blown, the head waiter relayed these details to me as soon as I gave my name, which I spoke loud enough for the chefs at the central table to overhear.” Jane and Peter, wide-eyed, stared up at Uncle Robert in anticipation. “As I took my seat in the restaurant, I began to feel very nervous. The first part of my mission had now been achieved: I was successfully impersonating our captured spy. But I knew that if I ordered the wrong dish, I would immediately give myself away and put my own life in danger.” “Oh no!” Peter gasped. “As I told you earlier, one of the chefs was the contact. But he wouldn’t risk making any sign to me, so I had to try and figure out which dish I was supposed to order. I was wearing the captured spy’s clothes, and before entering the restaurant I had gone through his wallet to see if it contained some clues. All I had found was an old bus ticket, a locker key and a card thanking the bearer for his donation to a charity called Vegetarian Way.” “What does vegetarian mean? Peter inquired. “Vegetarian’s don’t eat meat,” Jane answered. “That’s right, Jane. … Now, there were four dishes available that evening, each prepared by a different chef. Gianni Girodano was making Italian-style vegetable lasagna. Atsushi Nishi was preparing Japanese yakisoba noodles. Jean-Pierre Dubois was making French onion soup and Jack McDonald had prepared a traditional haggis and trimmings. Trying to act casual, I talked to my waiter about the dishes to see if I could uncover any clue to help me decide which to order.” “He said: ‘I recommend the delicious French onion soup, sir. It has been very popular this evening.’ To which I repied: ‘Do you serve the same dishes all day?’” “What did he say then?” Peter interrupted. “He replied: ‘No, sir, there is a lunch menu and a dinner menu … but sometimes if a dish is popular at lunch, we keep the chef engaged to make another session for the evening customers. This is the case with the French onion soup today.’” “I love French onion soup,” Peter added. “Well, I’ll have to make you some soon. But back to the mystery, Peter. … The Italian chef seemed very popular. He was flirting with the female customers seated nearest to the serving area as he sprinkled fresh basil across a row of lasagna’s all lined up in blue dishes, capped at the end by one in a red dish.” “Did the waiter provide more clues?” Jane asked “Yes, he did.” As I watched the restaurant, the Japanese chef tossed ingredients high into the air, catching them in his frying pan. The waiter followed my gaze and nodded in approval. The waiter said: ‘Atsushi is preparing yakisoba stir fry noodles and watching him work is a real treat. He is quite the showman, and we’re lucky to have him here as part of his world tour. In fact, this is the sixth restaurant he has cooked in today, and I believe he will have one more session before he is finished for the night.’” Uncle Robert stopped his story, and looked closely at Peter and Jane. “So, children,” said Uncle Robert, “who can tell me which chef was the contact spy?” Which chef was the spy?", "output": "The children all thought for a while until their frowns of concentration began to be replaced by sleepy blinks.\n\n“What do you think?” Uncle Robert asked Peter who was deeply wrapped up in thought.\n\n“Well,” Peter said, “someone who would donate to a vegetarian society would probably not want to eat haggis, so I don’t think the spy would have arranged to have that dish brought to him.”\n\n“He wouldn’t have had to eat it,” said Jane.\n\n“He’d still not like that it was made from animals,” Peter insisted.\n\n“Go on, Peter,” Uncle Robert said with a smile.\n\n“The chef who made the French onion soup was only there because his soup sold so well at lunch. So if it hadn’t been popular, he wouldn’t have been there at night. It was just down to chance that he was there.”\n\n“You’re right, Peter. But what about the Japanese chef?”\n\n“The Japanese chef was going from place to place and only cooking for a short time. Since the spy only booked a table for 30 minutes, but didn’t know exactly when that time would be, it’s likely he would have missed that chef and never had a chance to order the noodles.”\n\n“So who was it then?” Jane, the eldest child, asked sleepily.\n\n“The Italian of course,” Peter replied, “he was using the blue dishes to prepare lasagnas in, but he’d kept one back from an earlier made round, in a red dish! And he must have put the chip in that when he made it.”\n\n“Well, I’m glad that Peter is so clever,” Jane said as she pushed back her Uncle’s old police helmet, which kept falling down over her eyes.\n\nAs the children started to nod off after the excitement, Uncle Robert left the room with a smile and went to tell their mother that the little ones were ready for bed.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

Bluebirds are one of the few thrush genera in the Americas. They have blue, or blue and rose beige, plumage. Female birds are less brightly colored than males, although color patterns are similar and there is no noticeable difference in size between the two sexes.\nBluebirds are territorial and prefer open grassland with scattered trees. This is similar to the behavior of many species of woodpeckers. Bluebirds can typically produce between two and four broods during the spring and summer (March through August in the Northeastern United States). Males identify potential nest sites and try to attract prospective female mates to those nesting sites with special behaviors that include singing and flapping wings, and then placing some material in a nesting box or cavity. If the female accepts the male and the nesting site, she alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "How does Astronomy, amateur and professional, contribute to humanity and a better world?\n\nI think this is a good question to ask.  \nThere are possibly many aspects to this question. Astronomy and seeking knowledge has lead to the development of space probes, space science, development of technology, it provides and evidence based view of our universe and context to societal and cultural understandings, it provides intellectual interest and pursuit to many, particularly at amateur level, to suggest a few.\nWhat would a full list include of the positive aspects of contribution? How has an interest in Astronomy, or an answer to an Astronomy question, made a positive difference in your life? \nSeeking specific answers and examples, not discussion. \n\nA:\n\nIncomplete list of ways astronomy has helped humanity:\n\nThe study of astronomy in ancient times was necessary for predicting the seasons and aided in farming as calendars were (and still are) based on astronomical events. (source)\nIn ancient times (and still today) studying astronomy was greatly important for navigation. Sighting on stars or the Sun can tell you your position in the world. (source)\nStudying astronomy has helped humanity answer some of it's most basic questions of our place in the universe. Examples include Galileo's evidence that we are not the center of the universe (source) or the Shapley-Curtis debate which ultimately proved humanity was even smaller than we thought. This fulfills certain philosophical needs that I believe everyone possesses.\nUsing spectroscopy, we first found the existence of Helium in the Sun before we knew about it from chemistry or discovered it on Earth (source). Helium has become immensely useful for a variety of technologies including various science technologies and medical devices (source).\nAstronomy has helped us prove General Relativity, one of the important theories describing our universe. Practical uses of GR include GPS technology (source).\nAstronomy may help us answer the question of whether we're alone in the universe. Obviously this is highly presumptive, but I would not be surprised to learn that within 30 years we will have some evidence of the existence of (microbial) life outside our solar system using the future missions TESS and JWST (source).\nThe entire realm of space physics, a sub-category of astronomy, has resulted in, arguably, the largest impact on humanity. Our ventures into space have resulted in an explosion of technology that needed to be developed to overcome hurdles of space travel which then found applications in our every day life. NASA even publishes a magazine called Spinoff which documents these many technologies.\nIn the same vein as the last point, humanity's space race and technological feats related to space have inspired generations of students to become scientists and engineers. Don't have a source for this directly, but I'd be surprised if no one was inspired by the space race.\nIn many ways, concepts in astronomy guided work in particle physics. The need to conserve energy in fusion reactions in the Sun ultimately led to the proposal for the existence of the neutrino (source). Furthermore, neutrino oscillations were a proposed solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem.\nAstronomy helped to predict the existence of dark matter. This is somewhat presumptive as well, but if we can prove dark matter exists, and understand it in more depth, there's no telling what technologies may result from that.

{"input": "I need to make a stuffed animal, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you give me 16 actionable steps?", "output": "Stuffed animals provide companionship and foster creativity for children. They are both playmates and bedroom decorations. From sea monsters to dogs and stuffed toy cats, most animals can be made into plush toys. With a little creativity of your own, you can inexpensively make a custom stuffed animal toy.\n1. Line up your fabric.: You want the best sides of your fabric turned inwards to face each other. If you’re not sewing your stuffed animal, you don’t need to pin the sides together.\nRemember: for this method, thicker, stronger fabrics work better.\n2. Attach your sides together.: The two easiest no-sew ways to attach them are with hot glue or with staples. If your stuffed animal is for a small child, choose glue. Staples can be choking hazards or cause cuts.\n\nIf you’re using hot glue, run a thin line of glue along the sides of your animal a quarter to one-half inch away from the edge. Press the sides together, and let the glue dry and cool completely before moving on.\n\nTo staple, just staple around the sides leaving, again, a quarter to one-half inch of space at the edge. Place the staples close together without leaving gaps in between.\nIn both methods, leave about an inch open so that you’ll be able to stuff your animal.\nAlternatively, you can use fabric glue in place of hot glue. You’ll simply need to let it dry for several hours before manipulating it.\n3. Flip your fabric inside out.: Through the gap you left in the side, you should pull the fabric through. Be especially careful not to pull out any of your staples or put holes in your hot glue edge.\nWhen you turn your animal inside out, the raw edges will be hidden, and the good side of your fabric will now be visible.\n4. Stuff your animal.: Once you turn your fabric, you’ll need to begin filling your animal. You want to fill it without straining the staples or glue. For this project, you can find stuffing at local craft stores.\nUse your hands to push the stuffing in as much as you can, and use the end of a wooden spoon, a dowel, or a chopstick to help push the stuffing into all the hard-to-reach corners of your animal.\n5. Close up the gap.: After you’ve stuffed your animal, you’ll want to use a few staples or another line of glue to seal up the small hole in your animal. Even if you used staples around the perimeter of your animal, consider using glue for this small hole so that you won’t have any visible staples.\nTuck the raw edges of the fabric in so that they don’t show.\n6. Decorate your stuffed animal.: After you’ve finished the basics, you can add more character to your creation to make it unique and special. Decorations come in all kinds of forms and can be made from fabric scraps, things you have around the house like buttons, or even just drawn on with markers.\n\nGlue on buttons or googly eyes. Again, be careful with these around small children, as they can be choking hazards.\nUse a fabric paint or fabric markers to draw on other features.\nYou can even use scrap fabric to hot glue or staple together clothes for your stuffed animal.\n7. Choose a fabric for your stuffed animal.: You can go with realistic coloring, like browns and greys, or pick a fun pattern like polka dots.  Keep in mind that some types of fabric are easier to work with than others.\n\nGreat fabrics for beginners include cotton quilting fabric, which comes in many fun patterns, and felt. Felt works especially well if you don’t want to sew your stuffed animal.\nIf you choose patterned fabric for your project, pick a pattern that looks nice when connected randomly. Sometimes patterns like stripes or chevron can be difficult to line up.\nYou can buy fabric at most craft and hobby stores.\nIf you’d rather not go out and buy fabric, consider repurposing some old fabric. You could easily use an old dress shirt, tablecloth, or towel to create your stuff animal.\n8. Pick an animal.: Before you begin creating your pattern, you’ll want to decide what animal you want to create. As you are brainstorming, try to choose an animal that has a distinct shape and a simple silhouette.\n\nSome possible options include: a cat, a bear, a rabbit, a monkey, an owl, or a fish.\n\nYou can also make things that aren’t animals like flowers or stars.\n9. Make your pattern.: For this simple project, feel free to use any type of paper that you have on hand. Since you will only have two pieces of fabric to connect, your pattern is basically just a simple template for cutting out those pieces.\n\nDecide how large you want your stuffed animal to be when it’s finished. You’ll need to make your pattern one-half to one inch larger all the way around.\nSimply draw a two-dimensional outline of your animal.\n\nIf you’d rather not freehand your pattern, you can find many free, printable animal patterns online.\n\nOnce you’ve drawn your pattern, cut it out along the edges.\n10. Prepare your fabric.: After you’ve made your pattern, you’ll need to transfer it onto your fabric. Make sure the fabric you’re using is ironed or steamed and free from creases. This will make it much easier to work with.\n\nLay your pattern on top of your fabric. Draw around its online with a dark marker or a piece of white chalk. Do this twice, one for each side of your stuffed animal.\nCut your fabric along the line you drew. It’s best to use sharp sewing scissors to cut fabric, if you have them.\n11. Pin your fabric together.: Before you begin to sew your animal, you’ll want to use straight sewing pins to pin your two pieces of fabric to each other. This ensures your fabric pieces stay lined up correctly as you begin to sew.\n\nPin your fabric inside out. This means that you’ll want the two finished sides of the fabric facing inward toward each other.\nUse the pins horizontally around the perimeter of your animal. You want your pins to be about half an inch apart all the way around.\n12. Sew your sides.: You can make your homemade stuffed animal either with a sewing machine or with  basic hand stitching. Before you begin to sew, thread a needle, and knot the end of your thread. Use thread that is the same color as your fabric or use a contrasting color for decoration.\n\nSew about a quarter of an inch to a half-inch from the edge of the fabric.\nWhether you are hand sewing or using a machine, leave about an inch left unsewn so that you can stuff your animal. This often works well at the end of a leg.\nAfter you finish sewing, remove all the straight pins from the perimeter of your animal.\n13. Turn your animal inside out.: Using the hole that you left unsewn, pull your fabric through, and turn it inside out. It may take a bit of work to pull all of the fabric through your whole.\nWhen you turn it inside out, the raw stitching should be hidden, and the good side of your fabric will now be visible.\n14. Stuff your animal.: Once you turn your fabric, you’ll need to begin filling your animal. You’ll want to make sure it’s full but that there is no strain on the stitching. You can find stuffing at local craft stores.\nUse the end of a wooden spoon, dowel, or chopstick to help push the stuffing in all the corners of your animal.\n15. Close up your hole.: After you’ve stuffed your animal, you’ll want to sew up the small hole you used to put in the stuffing. Doing this should not take very much thread. Use the same thread that you used for the perimeter of your animal.\nKnot the end of your last stitch so it stays in place. Trim any excess threads.\n16. Embellish your creature.: Once you finish sewing your stuffed animal, you can add more character with various kinds of decorations. These will make you animal come alive. Feel free to use items you have on hand, or pick some decorations up at a craft store.\n\n\nSew buttons on for eyes or a nose. If you are giving your animal to a small child, be wary of buttons, as they can become choking hazards.\nUse fabric paints or markers to draw in details. This can be a good option for smaller children, as they can’t pull off small pieces of decoration.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

I think that what I was just thinking about over the last year is just there hasn’t been a full investigation by law enforcement and that is just absolutely absurd,\" Raisman said in an exclusive interview with \"Today\" on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, Penny pleaded not guilty to charges of tampering with evidence in the Nassar case. He's accused of ordering documents be removed from Karolyi Ranch, where the USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center is located, when he learned it was being investigated.\nPenny's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said on Monday that Penny has never seen the documents, does not know their contents nor their location.\nHardin declined to comment to NBC News about Raisman's claims.\nThe Schwikert sisters say they were abused by Nassar, who was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison. Nassar pleaded guilty to the molestation of 10 victims but has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 250 young women and men.\nIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it was “deeply sorry” that the Schwikert sisters or any athletes were abused.\n“The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever,” the statement said.\nRaisman called on USA Gymnastics for greater transparency and asked that a thorough investigation into the organization be conducted.\n\"There is no new USA gymnastics until we understand every single thing that happened because we can’t trust USA Gymnastics because they’re not being transparent,\" Raisman said.\nNew unspecified allegations have come out against a USA Gymnastics tumbling and trampoline coach, which forced the coach to resign.

{"input": "Explain the economic destruction of Venezuela due to socialism.", "output": "In the early hours of Thursday, November 2, the Maduro regime certified its latest failure with what they promised would never happen: technical default. With his usual arrogance, Maduro issued a “decree” demanding “the refinancing and restructuring of the debt as of November 3.” That is, default.\nThe bad news for investors or high-yield hunters is that the likelihood of being swindled again is almost 100%.\nChavez once said “put me oil at zero and Venezuela will not suffer,” and Maduro stated that “a revolutionary government with economic power as the one I preside has plans to surpass any situation arising from any price of oil.” Reality has now kicked in.\nVenezuela was not destroyed by low oil prices, but by high socialism.\nSocialism has led Venezuela to an unparalleled economic disaster . No, it’s not “the price of oil.” Venezuela is the only OPEC country that has fallen into default, depression, and hyperinflation. It’s not oil, it’s socialism.\nThe management disaster is spectacular and the greatest example of the devastating effect of socialism is the state-owned oil company. PdVSA, the national oil company, has gone from being one of the most efficient and profitable twenty years ago, to end up importing oil.\nAlthough Venezuela has the largest reserves of crude oil in the world — 296 billion barrels — the country began importing oil last year. Its production is less than 2.7 million barrels per day, a drop of 20% in less than two decades, while the Chavez.Maduro regime multiplied its workforce by five, to 175,000 “workers”.\nBrutal cost increases, spectacular worsening of production, collapse in margins and plundering of the cash to pay for subsidies led the company from being one of the most profitable and with the best balance sheet in the world to borrow more than 43 billion US dollars.\nDuring the presidency of Maduro, the regime has led the country to hyperinflation, which already exceeds 2000% and a shortage of more than 80% in goods, while foreign currency reserves have plummeted 64%, the worst level in forty years.\nThis disaster is not because of low oil prices, it is a reflection of the reality of what socialism does. No oil producing country shows such atrocious figures, not even close.\nIn fact, if anything can be said about the fall in oil prices is that the vast majority of producing countries have managed it admirably, with GDP drops that ended being much lower than feared, keeping their reserves in foreign currency at comfortable levels, and adapting to the new reality quickly and efficiently. Almost all, except Venezuela.\nVenezuela had 12,700 private companies when Chávez took power, according to Conindustria. Today there is less than one-third of that figure. To the economic destruction, the regime added the assault on private property with expropriations of more than 690 companies in twelve years. Today, those expropriated companies are technically bankrupt and those that survive are zombies producing less than half of the figures prior to the confiscation.\nAs always happens in socialism, the first thing was to deny reality. “Investors should not worry about the debt repayments of 2017 and 2018,” said Rafael Ramírez. And indeed, they should not have worried. They should have panicked. One of the largest investment banks in the world, which bought $ 2.8 billion of bonds is now facing the false “restructuring” decreed by Maduro.\nMaduro “decrees” restructuring as if it were a miracle. But it is another nail in the coffin of the regime. Economic destruction is not only not changing, it is getting worse.\nThe restructuring simply has no solution. Correa, in Ecuador, has already experienced the “success” of default.\nCorrea in Ecuador defaulted on 3.2 billion US dollars to finish depending on China at a much higher cost (7.5%) and shorter maturities (8 years). And Ecuador now discovers that its real debt is more than 41.8 billion dollars instead of the 27.8 billion that Correa left as “official”. That hole will cost billions in adjustments. This is the reality of default and re-structuring. Things get worse.\nBut Ecuador at least had an economy with growth possibilities. Maduro now seeks to refinance with … what? He has devastated the country. Between 1999 and 2014, Venezuela received 960.5 billion US dollars of oil revenues, 56.5 billion annually for 17 years, five times more than the average annual real income of previous governments between 1993 and 1998, according to the BBC quoting Ecoanalítica.\nThat huge oil revenue was squandered and at the same time the economy was destroyed by assaulting legal security and investment initiative with savage expropriations. Who is going to lend to such disastrous managers, even at higher rates and different terms? Now the string of litigation and complaints about breach of contracts will begin. And the credit tap closes.\nThis restructuring is not going to be a relief nor the beginning of the solution. It is the verification of an absolute failure of the Venezuelan government and it will cost a lot, as always, to the poorest citizens. Because there has never been a story of default that is accompanied by higher real public spending. Never .\nThe lesson of this new example of socialist failure is that it is a system based on lies that ignores the most basic principles of the economy and destroys even the richest country.\nIn the end, the socialist promise of free money is very expensive for all. Let’s learn the lesson.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

For Firefox users with unfiltered access to the Internet, this change probably went unnoticed, since there simply aren’t that many new SHA-1 certs being used. However, for Firefox users who are behind certain “man-in-the-middle” devices (including some security scanners and antivirus products), this change removed their ability to access HTTPS web sites. When a user tries to connect to an HTTPS site, the man-in-the-middle device sends Firefox a new SHA-1 certificate instead of the server’s real certificate. Since Firefox rejects new SHA-1 certificates, it can’t connect to the server.\nIf you can access this article in Firefox, you’re fine. If you’re reading this in another browser, see if you can load the security blog (or any other HTTPS link) in Firefox. Click “Advanced”, and if you see the error code “SEC_ERROR_CERT_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_DISABLED”, then you’re affected.\nThe easiest thing to do is to install the newest version of Firefox. You will need to do this manually, using an unaffected copy of Firefox or a different browser, since we only provide Firefox updates over HTTPS.\nIf you want to avoid reinstalling, advanced users can fix their local copy of Firefox by going to about:config and changing the value of “security.pki.sha1_enforcement_level” to 0 (which will accept all SHA-1 certificates).\nYou should also make sure that any systems you have that might be doing man-in-the-middle are up to date, for example, some anti-virus software or security scanning devices. Some vendors have removed the use of SHA-1 in recent updates.\nWe are still committed to removing support for SHA-1 certificates from Firefox. The latest version of Firefox re-enables support for SHA-1 certificates to ensure that we can get updates to users behind man-in-the-middle devices, and enable us to better evaluate how many users might be affected.

{"input": "Describe a walk you take in your city.", "output": "Carl Nolte March 17, 2018 Updated: March 17, 2018 10 a.m.\nSunday is always my favorite day — a leisurely breakfast, a second cup of coffee, the Sunday papers, maybe a morning walk.\nLike a lot of people, I have mixed feelings about a walk in the city these days. The Sunday before, my companion and I had walked the streets of Washington, D.C., and marveled at how clean they were. On returning back home, it was clear how much of San Francisco was a mess, particularly downtown with its crowds of lost souls roaming filthy streets.\nSo I decided to avoid the heart of the city and head west, down the hill, across Mission and Guerrero streets, up through Noe Valley, toward the hills. It was a pleasant surprise, even to a grizzled native son.\nI went to Billy Goat Hill, an old favorite. Not far away, I found a secret street that led nowhere in particular. I took it and ended up in a Glen Park bookstore where a quartet was playing a jazz version of “On the Street Where You Live,” surrounded by stacks of books.\nBoth San Franciscos are on display, often within walking distance of each other. How can this be? I don’t know, but if I were an urban doctor, I’d refer this city to a psychiatrist. It clearly has a split personality.\nLet me tell you about my little walk. I headed up 30th Street, past where the J streetcar screeches around the curve. Up the hill, past little Victorian Noe Valley cottages. Working folks used to live there. Now a little old house with a view would sell for more than $2 million. That’s crazy.\nThirtieth Street dead-ends at the foot of steep Billy Goat Hill, with grass as green as Ireland in springtime. It is too steep for a road but there is a switchback trail, and at the top, an amazing view and two big old trees with a kind of swing. Kids get on it and swing out with the city at their feet.\nCarvings on a tree at Billy Goat Hill.\nI’m a former kid myself, and I remember how we knew all the names of the plants that grew on these grassy San Francisco hillsides. Not the scientific names, but any city kid can point out the licorice plant, the scissors plant, the tricky pee weed, so named because if you ate it you’d wet the bed that night. The big kids told us that, so it must be true.\nLeaving Billy Goat Hill, I followed streets just to see where they led, down and around corners to the edge of Glen Park. I had college friends who lived in that neighborhood. They rented a ramshackle old place and lived in glorious youthful poverty that would be impossible these booming days.\nBut around one corner I came on Penny Lane, a complete surprise. It is a mostly unpaved country road in the middle of the city. It leads past backyard fences next to a 20-foot-tall wire sculpture and branches off in two small, landscaped foot paths.\nAnd the paths eventually lead to Bird & Beckett books on Chenery Street, where Barbara Hunter was playing a flute solo as part of Sunday afternoon jazz.\nAll this is in the middle of a cold, hard city that seems indifferent to urban squalor. Yet all three of these Sunday places were made better by caring San Franciscans.\nBilly Goat Hill used to be a dead-end place used as a dump: old refrigerators, old stoves, junk. Neighbors, now organized as Friends of Billy Goat Hill, persuaded the city to turn the 3.5-acre site into a park and worked to improve it for everybody.\nGlen Park neighbors turned Penny Lane from an eyesore into an urban treasure. They had work days, cleared weeds and built a landscape at the end of the street where they lived. Even small children got to help. Bird & Beckett is kept alive by owner Eric Whittington and neighborhood patrons who buy books there instead of getting them cheaper on Amazon.\nThere are people like that in many corners of the city — people like Joan Carson and Nancy Windesheim, who organized volunteers and got the city to rebuild the Esmeralda Slide Park in Bernal Heights. “It is taking responsibility for something in your neighborhood,” Windesheim said.\nThere are more than 200 volunteer community groups in the city, caring for parks, urban gardens, even streets. “Citizen involvement is a very powerful thing to see,” said Charlie McCone of the city’s Parks Alliance, which coordinates volunteer efforts.\nTwo different worlds in the same city.

Where Red itself reproduces the flexibility of the REBOL language, the underlying language Red will be built upon, Red/System, covers the more basic needs of programming like C can, being closer to the metal.\nRed will be the world’s first Full Stack Programming Language. This means that it will be an effective tool to do (almost) any programming task on every level from the metal to the meta without the aid of other stack tools.

{"input": "What are the 16 fundamental steps to consider when attempting to keep a phone conversation going with your girlfriend?", "output": "You’re super into your girlfriend, so why is it so hard to come up with stuff to talk about on the phone? There’s gotta be a way to avoid those awkward pauses! Good news: we’ve dialed in on some key strategies to help you conquer your convo hangups. This article is packed with topic suggestions, tips for being a great listener, and ideas for responding supportively. Say goodbye to phone call anxiety and hello to conversations that bring you and your girlfriend closer together.This article is based on an interview with our professional matchmaker and dating coach, Patti Novak Williams. Check out the full interview here.\n1. Phrase your questions so they can't be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.\" If you simply ask, “Did you have a good day?” she’ll probably respond with, “Yeah.” Instead, ask, “What was an interesting thing that happened today?” Remember, the idea is to ask her things that lead naturally into conversation, not to pepper her with interview questions.\n\nTalk about mutual interests and acquaintances. Introduce a subject you can both relate to, like asking what she thought of the latest episode of a series you both watch, or whether she read a recent interview with a mutual favorite author, or what so-and-so has been up to lately.\n\nSeek advice or support. You probably offer your girlfriend a sympathetic ear and a shoulder to cry on, but your bond will be stronger if that goes both ways. If you’re struggling with something, it’s okay to be vulnerable and turn to her for advice or validation.\nInquire about her childhood. Try asking her, “When you were 7 years old, what did you want to be when you grew up?” People like to talk about themselves, and if you open that conversational door, your girlfriend will walk through it.\n2. If something interesting or funny happened, tell her about it. It can be easy to rely too heavily on gripes about frustrating situations when you do this, so try to make sure you are not just rattling off complaints. Keep the conversation going by asking what made her laugh today.\nTell her about something you saw or heard that reminded you of her.\n3. Brainstorm fun ideas of things the two of you could do this week. If you already have plans, talk about how excited you are to go to that concert, or mention a review you read of the play you’re going to see. This will get her excited, too, and make her feel like a valued part of your life.\n4. Tell her about some of your hopes and dreams. You don't want to monopolize the conversation, but she’ll be interested to know that she’s dating a person with ambitions.\n5. A little bit of gossip is okay as long as you avoid anything too brutal or personal. This should constitute a small portion of your conversation, but it can be an easy fallback if you’re at a loss. There aren't a lot of people who can resist indulging in gossip from time to time!\n6. Inviting her to tell you more about something she just said lets her know you’re interested. It will also extend the mileage you get out of that particular subject, saving you from immediately having to come up with a new topic. Try asking, “What was that like for you?”or “How did she react when you said that?”\n7. Practice active listening by giving brief affirmations, avoiding judgment, and asking clarifying questions. Active listening may be the most important conversational skill you can cultivate, because it helps other people feel heard and understood. This technique will not only make conversation flow more easily, it will also increase your girlfriend's trust in you.\nBeing a good listener is crucial for your relationship. Remember that what your girlfriend really wants is to feel listened to, heard and understood on every level, whether you talk about some petty things or the deepest ones.\n8. In a healthy relationship, there’s equal conversational space for both partners. That said, sometimes one of you will need more attention or support than the other. Be a good listener by allowing her to dominate the conversation when she needs to, without inserting your own ego.\n9. Sometimes you might be so focused on trying to think of things to say that you forget to really listen. As you let her say what she needs to and focus on listening without interrupting, you’ll be able to come up with comments or questions related to what she’s saying. Avoid multitasking during your phone conversations; if you’re distracted, she might pick up on that and feel hurt.\n10. Often this can be as simple as telling her, “That sounds really hard. I know how important your dog was to you.” This lets her know that you are listening and that you feel for her, while giving her plenty of space to continue sharing.\n11. If she just told you a story about a fight she had with her friends, avoid saying something like, “It sounds like your friends are real jerks. They don’t appreciate how great you are.” This may seem like a supportive way to respond, but the truth is that she loves her friends, and your harsh words will ultimately come back to haunt you. Try a gentler response like, “It sounds like you felt really disrespected by the way they spoke to you.” This validates the way she’s feeling, without pointing a finger of blame.\n12. Use phrases like, “Tell me more about it,” “I’d like to hear more about that,” “How did that feel?” or “What did you do then?” Even small comments like, “Go on,” or “Uh-huh,” are enough to encourage her to keep sharing.\n13. This will show her that you really pay attention to the things she shares with you, and that you care about the things that are important to her. Try asking things like, “So was your boss less of a jerk today?” or “Is your mom feeling better?” or “Did you finish that book you’ve been so into?”\n14. Many men tell people about their problems because it’s a practical route toward solving those problems. On the other hand, many women want empathy rather than practical suggestions. When your girlfriend tells you about something she’s struggling with, your first instinct may be to offer solutions. Avoid this; if she wants advice, she will probably ask for it. Until then, a good working assumption is that she really just wants to feel understood.\n15. Sometimes sharing a story about a time you experienced something similar can help validate her and make her feel less alone. It provides reassurance that the way she feels is normal and understandable.This isn’t appropriate in all situations (like, if her grandma passed away, don’t tell a story about your hamster dying). Keep it brief to avoid overshadowing her.\n16. It hurts to hear words like, “You’re overreacting,” “Don’t worry so much,” “You’ll feel better tomorrow,” “It’s not that bad,” or “There’s no reason to get so upset.” Whether or not you feel like her emotional response is appropriate, it doesn’t change what she is feeling. Emotions are not always rational, and people who are upset are not always reasonable. Right now your job is simply to listen.\n", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

The House passed the new law through a bipartisan voice vote last week, following approval by the Senate in March.\nSupport for reducing the disparity with powder cocaine offenders increased with reports beginning in 2002 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission calling for Congress to change the crack cocaine law. The commission is an independent agency in the judicial branch that develops national sentencing policy for the federal courts.\nRep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, recently contended that the new law will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Conyers said crack mandatory sentences had pushed the number of drug offenders in federal prisons from fewer than 5,000 in 1980 to nearly 100,000 in 2009.\nObama and Attorney General Eric Holder had both publicly pressed for passage of the new statute.\n\"This day was long in coming,\" Holder said recently. The attorney general claimed the bill will \"go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair.\"\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus had led the battle for passage for 10 years, but several key Republicans -- including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham -- also pushed for the change.\nHouse Republicans Dan Lungren of California, James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, and Ron Paul of Texas also provided high-profile support.\nNot all Republicans joined the majority, however.\nThe top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake.\n\"Reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused Congress to act in the first place,\" Smith said. \"Crack cocaine is associated with a greater degree of violence than most other drugs. And more than any other drug, the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions.\"", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}

{"input": "Explain what the Swords Castle Community Archaeology project entails and how people can get involved.", "output": "On Monday, 17th August a team of volunteers led by community archaeologist, Christine Baker began a month-long community excavation at Swords Castle. Since then, there has been lots of hard work and lots of finds to wash, sort and examine.\nSwords Castle: Digging History, is the County Council’s first Community Archaeology project. It’s providing local people with a unique opportunity to take part in a real archaeological excavation for the first time. Working with a small team of professional archaeologists, volunteers have been digging, discovering lots of artefacts and learning how to ‘do’ archaeology. Most of the artefacts found so far are from the nineteenth century like the clay pipes made by Downey Brothers of 8 Brunswick Street Dublin, but on only the second day of the dig volunteers found a piece of a medieval ridge tile – a very exciting find.\nThe excavation programme is designed to answer specific questions which remain about the Castle. Although Swords Castle is one of the best surviving examples of an archbishop’s residence in the country, and was an important administrative centre, there are some questions that remain unanswered: Is there a graveyard underneath the Castle? Were there buildings within the Castle yard? How old are the different buildings in the complex? Through this project, we hope to answer at least some of these questions. The results will not only tell us more about the Castle’s 800 year history, it will also inform the future development of the Castle as the Council implements the Swords Castle Conservation Plan published in 2014. Excavation takes place each weekday until 11th September and the Council is looking for volunteers to come along and join the team. Excavation work takes place from 10am to 4.30 pm each day. Volunteers must be over 18 years and the Council asks that volunteers come along at 10am and commit to (at least) one full day.\nAn exhibition called ‘My Castle’ also takes place in Swords Castle from now until Friday, September 4th (except for Sunday 30th August). The exhibition explores what the Castle means to the people of Swords.", "task_type": "factual_knowledge"}
