{"input": "When you die, you appear in a room with two buttons: Heaven and Hell. You do n't know which is which. So you press both at the same time.", "output": "The small square room was empty. Empty, that is, except for the two buttons in front of me. On the right button, which was the purest white colour one can imagine, the word HEAVEN was written in shining gold. On the left button, which bas black as night, I could just make out the word HELL. It was sloppily carved into the button itself. \" Okay, \" I thought, \" This seems relatively straightforward. \" I decided to press the button which said Heaven, as any normal person would do. As I lowered my hand to do so a thought suddenly entered my head. \" What if it's a trick? \" I stopped myself from pressing the button and decided to think it over one last time. I decided that if, indeed, it is a trick there is no way of knowing which button is the correct one. I surmised that the only reasonable thing to do was to press both buttons at the same time. This time I didn't give myself enough time to doubt my choice, I just slammed down on the buttons with all the force I could muster. Suddenly a door appeared to the left on the wall in front of me. As it opened a figure made its way through and faced me. I was somewhat taken aback when I realized that it was an elderly man clad in white robes with a cane in his left hand. He was short in stature and completely bald. One might think that this made the man appear frail or feeble. This was not the case. This was because the man had a great white beard which hung down to his chest and an old wisdom in his eyes. Something told me that those who crossed him would live to regret their lapse in judgement. The man looked me in the eyes and suddenly his entire being lit up. \" Michael my boy, how lovely to see you! \" He smiled at me with his entire being as I wondered how he knew my name. \" I've been waiting for you to come here for a long time! \" I finally mustered up the courage to speak. \" You have? \" \" Yes my boy, of -- - The man never got to finish his sentence as another door opened, this one on the right side of the wall. Another man, an exact copy of the first, stepped through it. He did not seem as friendly, however. He simply stared at me, stared into my very being, his eyes cold and calculating. He remained silent. The first man spoke. \" Well this was unexpected. Unexpected indeed! \" \" Quite.\" the second man replied, still keeping his stare on me. He did not speak in the same jolly voice as the first man. Rather, his voice was monotone and drab. I noticed that the smile on the first man's face was gone, replaced with a slight frown. \" Who are you?\" I asked the second man, well aware of the insecurity and fright in my voice. \" I am what you would call God\" he replied in the same monotone voice. God? I was standing face to face with the Holy Father himself! \" I'm sorry your eternal holiness, but I was expecting to see St.Peter...\" Suddenly the first man lit up again. \" Oh, Petey! It has been ever so long since I saw him. Lovely chap, Petey. I must pay him a visit soon!\" \" Yes, Mr. Peterson has been retired for quite some time. Additionally, if you must be formal, Mr.Summers, I prefer God. Otherwise my name is Bob.\" \" Yes, Mr. Gob, I mean Mr. Bod Sir!\" I blurted out. God raised one eyebrow and watched me with a look of bemusement. I felt my face redden. \" Now now, my boy! There is no need for panic. We are here to help you.\" The first man laughed. \" Indeed. The situation we find ourselves in is quite unusual, Mr. Summers. It will require your composure and utmost attention.\" God continued, his intent stare back once more. I wondered what he could possibly mean by this. How was this situation \" quite unusual \"? \" You see, no one has ever pressed both buttons at the same time before my boy! You're the first, one of a kind, a true original! \" the first man exclaimed. This struck me as odd, no one had tried this? Ever? \" So, what will happen to me? What should I do? \" I asked God and the first man feebly. \" It is really quite simple Mr. Summers. Behind one of these doors lies Heaven. Behind the other lies Hell. It is up to you to choose which door you think leads where. This you must do yourself, we can help you no further. \" God responded. I thought I was beginning to understand. To choose a door, I had to choose which of the men I thought really came from Heaven and follow him through his door. \" So, I have to pick one of you? \" I asked of the men. \" Right you are my boy, right you are! I must say you do catch on rather quickly! \" The first man replied, seeming jollier than ever. \" Quite. Choose wisely Mr. Summers. You will not be granted this opportunity again. \" God droned on. I caught myself wondering if God could really have such a monotone voice. I quickly dismissed the thought. So this was it. I was stood in front of the two men, one of whom was from Heaven and one of whom was from Hell. They were both staring at me quite seriously now. Strangely, I felt the choice was quite simple. One of the men had said he was God, so that must be the case. I had just decided to go with him when another thought struck me. His nickname. What did he say his nickname was? Bob. There was something about that nickname that made me uneasy, but I couldn't place it. I decided to ask. \" God? Why have you chosen Bob as your nickname? \" For the first time there was confidence in my voice. \" A good question indeed my boy! A good question indeed! \" Interrupted the first man, the grin once again visible on his face. \" What a strange question to ask when one's fate hangs in the balance, Mr. Summers. Despite this, I shall answer it. I have been called Bob for many ages, as long as the oldest inhabitants of Heaven remember. In fact, I can not remember the reason for the name myself. \" God answered. Suddenly, it hit me. I understood now. Bob was not the entire name. It had to have been changed through the ages. Once, it must have been Bub, which must be short for BEELZEBUB! I almost fainted right there and then. The second man was not god, but the Devil himself! I had almost fallen into his infernal trap, to be doomed for eternity, but I had prevailed! I had beaten the Devil! \" Mr. Summers, you seem to have made your choice. Would you care to enlighten us? \" the Devil spoke. \" Indeed I have, demon! I will be going with God, the real God! \" I spat at him, venom and defiance in my voice. \" Very well, Mr. Summers, may you find happiness in your choice. \" The Devil replied, seemingly unmoved by my words. The same could not be said for the first man, he was now laughing and jumping with joy. It was quite the sight, \" Well done my boy, well done! I knew you had it in you all along! When we arrive, you will be given a hero's welcome! \" The first man, God, replied. I felt relief rush through my body as I walked to meet him. I noticed that the Devil had left. Good. \" Thank you God, it was my faith in you that made this possible \" I said, almost sang, at God. God did not reply, only smiled the warmest of smiles. We started our walk, I beside my God. When I was closer to him I noticed the slightest tinge of red in his beard. He opened the door and as I walked through it I suddenly felt a fiery warmth on my skin.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It's a little safe, of course, no surprises, but solid analysis. Here's their # 1 overall, Jalen. You wo n't be getting him, of course, but this will give you an idea.\" \" Motor reflex, 8.9... Eye focus, 9.5... Facial mimic, 9.1... What does all this mean?\" \" Just measurement of his abilities. Do n't get hung up on the exact numbers, they're all relative, it's just meant as a guide to give you an idea of the babies development potential. Read the scouting report.\" \" Oh, down here...'Jalen is a ten day old prospect that already shows pattern recognition at a 40 day old level. His ability to grip and move his hands to his own mouth are the highest we've ever seen. His crying ability has left some scouts questioning his future vocal abilities, but this is more than made up for with his ability to follow moving lights and even recognize some shapes and colors. He is easily the most advanced baby in this draft, and we feel he is destined for future greatness at the toddler level.\"'\" He's terrific, for sure. But again, Jalen is a once in a generation prospect. George and Amal Clooney have the # 1 pick, and word on the street is that they've already told Jalen's agent he will be their selection. Scroll down to the mid 2000's, and you'll get some info on the kind of prospects you'll be looking at.\" \"...'Julia's body fat percentage of 20 % is worrisome to some scouts, but with proper diet and training she can easily bulk up to 24, 25 % after landing with the right family. She exhibits very impressive core body strength, and we predict rolling over by 5 months.'This is a lot to take in...\" \" Well, just keep in mind, you never know who's going to drop. I remember a few years ago when Jim and I were thinking about drafting another kid, we had our eye on a black-haired boy from Scranton named William. Well, William was getting Top 1000 buzz, and when Jim and I only slotted in the mid 50,000's, we decided to trade our pick to a couple in Phoenix for a pet to be named later. But then word got out that William was suffering from a pretty severe case of cradle cap, and he dropped to the 100,000's... we could have easily snatched him up. And do you know what William is doing today? Leading goal scorer on his under-8 soccer team at Rosemont Acadamy!\" \" Wow...\" \" So I guess the best advice I can give you is, look through any mocks you can find, identify the dozen or so babies that you want to target, and then just wait and see. Maybe there's a couple who wants to move back in the draft in exchange for a Lexus lease, or a timeshare in Miami. Maybe someone is looking to trade up to score a top flight breast feeding prospect, and you could find yourself with two picks in the later rounds. Keep your options open.\" \" We will.

I was sitting there head in my hands, trying to get an hour of studying in through a hangover and mumbling to myself and next thing I know all my papers are on fire. I do n't know how the fuck it happened but it did. As I'm staring flabbergasted at what's left of my desk, when Tommy calls. Right away I'm assaulted by a series of clicks and more guttural sounds. \" Dude, I just woke up and suddenly I could do this\" \" What the hell, was that?\" \" I can speak one of those fuckin African click languages\" \" Uhhh, I do n't think it's called African fucking click language\" \" whatever the point is I could do it out of nowhere, I've been watching youtube all morning, those old nat geo documentaries, I can understand all those crazy tribe people.......Its awesome, What about you?\" \" Hungover, starting fires, only can speak good English and bad English, typical Saturday morning\" \" oh shitty, Anyways i got ta go\" The next hour of my life is fielding phonecalls from friends and family, while my mind churns though a deep whiskey sludge. My dad knows Japanese now, Grandma speaks \" like one of them beaners\" ( I think she means spanish ). Stacey my ex who wo n't let the cord fully sever called me a \" unmotiviert Faule Kind\". I'll look that one up later. Its during a call from my 10 year old sister, who is a the only person who A ) can always cheer me up and B ) I always want to talk to, that I blow up my microwave. She's babbling in my ear in Mandarin, and telling me how awesome it and everything is, when I reach out to open the microwave. A few words are mumbled and *BOOM* there goes my microwave. \" Ohmygodwhatwassthatareyouok, please tell me you were n't exploded?\" \" Sis its ok, it was just a loud noise that's all, I'm sitting here unexploded\" *unlike my microwave* We say our good goodbyes, after I reassure her one more time that all my parts are still fully attached. I reply the incident in my head, approach the microwave, sister going on over the phone, mumble a few words, a flash and no more microwave. A flash? only it was n't it a flash, was it? No it was only an instant but it was more of an ark? it was an ark...........of electricity......... WHAT....THE.......FUCK. My mind is still only working at 60 percent speed but the same thing happened before my desk went up, I mumbled a few words and it ignited. Ma... magic? My mind reels at the thought and I slump down next to the fridge. For then next hour I stay there, moving only to fill my water bottle as the hangover lifts strange new words, chants swirl in my head. I do n't know what all of them mean, but fire and lighting, levitation. Some are the pallor tricks people make a fortune off of in Vegas, only for real, no tricks. Some are far more sinister. I find myself at a isolated beach in the afternoon, plying my new craft. I float myself, logs and even a downed tree, I doubled a frog in size and shrink it down. I hurl fireballs into the sea and shoot lighting out of my arse. I figure out how to say the words so its a little ball no bigger then a pebble or a gaint beachball of flames. i say the more sinster words and birds drop from the sky. I'm not malicious but I need to know what every spells is, last thing I want is to lose control and hurt someone I love. I get an idea and scramble to pull my phone out. For the first time in weeks I say more to my mom then \" Put Kimmy on the phone\". Not much more but after a short talk, Frank ( her husband to be ) agrees to bring my sis to the beach. He's an alright sort, we chat a few moments when he drops her off, He can speak Russian and has already agreed to teach Kimmy if she teaches him Mandarin. I should let you know about her briefly, Kimmy was the result of a misguided last ditch attempt of my parents to save their marriage. As far as I'm concerned she's also the only good thing to come out of it. Frank's good with her and keeps mom in check, it took awhile but i do n't mind the guy. After he leaves I call her over, get down on one knee and make her promise not to tell anyone what's about to happen. Never ever. She nods and I say the words that cause her to float a couple feet over the rocks and drift wood. An ear shattering scream of terror followed by an even more hearing loss inducing one of glee cut though the air. I spin with some flair conjure up a fireball and send it sailing 40 feet out into the water. We play invisible hide and seek, I show her the lighting blots and conjure up ice like her hero in frozen. She's so excited she never notices the dead birds near by. She begs and pleads, offering everything show owns for me to teach her. The only one I dare teach her is how to slow time. Its only in a case of extreme danger, I explain, only do it to escape a bad situation. She agrees but goes right back to pestering me. \" I ca n't, you're ten.

A shiver went through the back of neck as I remembered all those nights her mother had whispered into my ear, sweet syllables in another language that penetrated my brain and tattooed themselves onto my heart. \" Ok, I get limit theory, but what about continuous series? How do they fit in? \" I explained the nuances of calculus to her using the same words that had brought her mother and me together so long ago. I was her tutor, and she had been my love. \" Let's take a look at the topics on the more recent problem sets, since those are the topics I will cover on the midterm on Friday. \" She nodded eagerly. I pulled out a copy of the midterm and carefully laid it on the desk in front of me, as if to use it as a reference for our discussion. It was only six questions, but like any good math test, each question had multiple steps, each would be graded. She glanced down at the single sheet of paper and back at me. The questions were upside down to her, but like any almost college educated twenty year-old, I was sure she was frantically memorizing the questions. I turned my back on her and started writing on the whiteboard behind my desk, giving her ample opportunity to scrutinize the test without the risk of me seeing. \" Determining second order Taylor polynomials means we need to add quadratic terms to our linear approximation… \" I droned in my best monotone, perfectly aware that she was not paying the least bit of attention to the myriad of functions and Greek letter I was scribbling on the board.

I still almost caught her. \" Does that help Hannah? \" I held her gaze just a second longer than needed. A silent message flashed between us. She glanced up at the mess I had written on the white board and nodded. \" Great, I will see you in class on Friday. \" \" Thank you so much Professor Pitt. \" She gave me a smile, her mother's smile, stuffed her notebook back into her bag and left.

I looked back at my assailant just in time to see his look of confusion. He did n't get it. they never did, not right away. I began my little mental game. It was n't a game I played with others, more of a personal gambling thing. *I bet he thinks its some man o'steel BS. * I thought to myself. Surprisingly, his look of confusion gave way to one of utter determination. He dropped the gun, raised his fists, and charged. I blinked, but other wise I made no move. There was really no need. As he closed, his eyes took on a look that one gets when ones chess opponent has made a fatal flaw. He launched a hard right at my temple. His fist made contact, then burst into flames, rendered to ash. He screamed. I stood there, placing my wager on what was going through his mind as he writhed in the snow, rubbing his stump in the frost that coated the ground. *Maybe he just is n't thinking. * He finally stopped screaming, and his eyes whipped back to me. *Is he smiling? Oh. * The flesh from his stump stretched, the exposed bone lengthening. He was a regenerator. How boring. He did n't even wait to finish regrowing his hand before he tried to strike again, stabbing up at my ribs with the sharp end of bone. These regenerators never thought before they acted, they jut relied on a wolverine-esque powers of regrowth to carry the day. My little mental game was over. No point wasting time. As his bone pierced my jacket, he let out a premature scream of victory before being catapulted backwards against the wall behind him, shattering his skull and sending bits of blood everywhere.

The only restriction was that I had to be touching the thing whos energy I wanted to convert. I had converted to kinetic energy of the bullet into potential energy. I had turned the kinetic energy of his fist into heat energy. When he tried to stab me, I had converted his potential energy into backward kinetic energy. And now I was turning the heat energy of his body into potential energy, freezing him from within. Soon he was a human ice sculpture, half regrown and all kinds of grotesque. \" Fucking idiot.\" I flicked his frozen nose, converting every ounce of potential energy in his body into heat and kinetic, vaporizing him on the spot.

Lex goes to the Fortress of Solitude to steal the Kryptonian tech crystals. He says his, \" Tell me everything\" line. But he does n't use the crystals to make an island. He learns there is something much better he can do with this ridiculously advanced technology. After sleepless days and nights of listening to Jor-El's recording of Kryptonian history ( and Ms. Kowalski's complaints about the cold and dull the Fortress is ), he comes to learn about an artificial intelligence known on Krypton as Brainiac. He learns that at some, the scientist who invented the technology, Jax-Ur, became obsessed with his creation, so much that he found a way to join together with the technology. Jax-Ur/Brainiac plans to collect all of Krypton's knowledge and then destroy it, but Krypton resists. During the fight, many Kryptonians are killed, and one of Krypton's moons is destroyed, as Jax-Ur/Brainiac have become significantly stronger, faster, and smarter upon joining. The Kryptonians finally manage to beat Jax-Ur/Brainiac, separate the two, and exile Jax-Ur to the Phantom Zone. The technology, deemed still excellent and perfectly usable, as long as not effected by another being, by the science council, and is still the same technology used in young Kal-El's vessel, and by extension, the Fortress. Lex is psyched.

After telling her a short story about Superman, and how he saved her again, she goes to turn out the lights and leave, but her son says, \" Mommy, can I be Superman too?\".

He's confused, angry, does n't know how to deal with it. He's mad that she never told him she slept with Superman, let alone or right before they were together, and asks her how he supposed to raise Superman's kid. He leaves for a bit. He gets drunk, angry, and starts yelling about how he hates Superman at a bar, where he causes a scene. This is televised, as he is the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Planet's nephew, and this is a bit of an embarrassment for a newspaper that is so pro-Superman. Ms. Kowalski is watching it, and Lex notices. He decides to use Richard for his Brainiac combination. He takes Richard to his secret lair, tells him what he can do for him, that he can kill Superman, yada yada yada. Richard agrees, not realizing the consequences, obviously. Lexx combines Richard with Brainiac. He sends him off to terrorize the White House or something, but Richard/Brainiac is like, \" NO.\" and grabs Lex by the throat. Lex stabs him with a Kryptonite blade, but it does n't work as well as he had hoped, ( as Richard/Brainiac is half human ), and Richard/Brainiac knocks him out, and goes to find Superman. Superman is off thinking about his newly discovered son, and then BAM. Brainiac/Richard shows up. He's like, \" I HATE YOU. I'm GON NA KILL YOU. AND DESTROY THE WORLD. BECAUSE I'm BRAINIAC, AND THAT'S WHAT I DO. YADA YADA YADA.\" Superman and Richard/Brainiac duke it out. It's awesome. They do n't fight in Metropolis, but like, over the water, or in a deserted area of some kind. It's EPIC. Lois sees this on the news. She's like, aww shit! The two loves of my life are killing each other! And books it onto a helicopter. Jason ( little Supes ) sees this, and follows her, because he can fly and shit. They get to the scene of the fight, and Jason is like, holy shit, that's Superman fighting my daddy. He gets upset, and intervenes. He heat visions the FUCK out of Superman. Superman is n't about to hit a kid, so he tries to get away from him, telling him to get away because it's dangerous, while also fighting off Richard/Brainiac, who is even madder now, because he is now convinced that Superman wants to take his son. Richard finally gets a good shot on Superman, and starts pummeling the Kryptonian SHIT out of him. Jason realizes that his dad is a raging maniac, and knocks him down. Richard/Brainiac realizes what he's been doing, and, very upset, flies away into the sky. Jason goes up to Superman to see if he's alright, and, Lois shortly follows. Superman thanks Jason for saving his life, and Jason says that it's what Superman would've done. And that he wishes he could be Superman. Richard/Brainiac is missing. Superman takes Lex to prison ( again ), and all is well. Lois is sad, but adjusting to raising Jason on her own. Well, kind of alone. Superman takes him out to teach him to fly better and control his powers. All throughout, there is a sub-plot involving Clark interviewing and writing an article about an inner city woman who has lost her son, and hopes to find him again.

Silva was a pretentious ass. \" There may be need for functioning weaponry, sir.\" Anders sighed wearily and pulled up the exact report on his desk. It hovered in front of him, scrolling down slowly. \" One hundred thousand rifles, automatic, space-jacketed. One hundred thousand side arms, semi-automatic, space-jacketed. Fifty thousand boarding axes. Fifty thousand anti-personnel explosive devices....

It's been 20 years, Silva. You were five. I was thirty. I do n't understand why you're more concerned about the Cerbians than I am.\" Silva said nothing. Anders leaned back in his chair.

You've heard of it, right? I know engineers are n't keen on history, but your parents were both Martian. They should have told you.\" \" They never talked about it. Sir.\" \" The Cerbians dropped into low orbit in a Warhawk, straight from warp. The shock wave nearly toppled the city. Then they began to fire. Super-lasers, plasma torpedoes, and good old fashioned Jason class ballistic rounds. The city had over a million people in it, and in less than an hour it had less then ten thousand. The Sol Alliance sent interceptors, but the Warhawk jetted out of the gravity well and warped again. Before they warped, they sent us a message.'Free our people.'A lot of us did n't know what that meant. But I sure as hell know the Senate did.\" \" What did it mean, sir?\" \" We had put martial law on one of their colonies. Our scientists were sent there. They cut all communication to the other colonies, and began to run experiments.\" \" What kind of experiments?\" \" Oh, anything you can think of. Biological warfare. Cybernetic implants. They would test weapons on unarmed men, then test prosthetic limbs on the survivors. That sort of thing.\" Silva was quiet while he processed this. He swayed a bit and relaxed his stance. Anders could hear the fan running in his desk, even though it was supposed to be whisper silent. He would ask Silva to fix it tomorrow. \" Silva, you're a good kid. But you're still young and reckless and stupid. You made a huge mistake, smuggling these on board. And you're going to make up for it. Understand?\" Silva nodded. He was trembling. \" Now go get me Major Cross. We'll talk about what to do with your little arsenal. And you're officially on parole. You'll have a marine escort you everywhere you go. Even to the bathroom. Also, you're working this flight for free. The cost of legal processing for moving such a large amount of weaponry is coming out of your pay.

In Shakespeare's *Hamlet* for example you'll find Horatio worrying about his friend, the troubled Prince, saying *All night the King's heir quacks with tears, as does the end forsaken. * The appearance of the word'duck'can be dated exactly to May 3d 1689, when Virgil, the sixth Duke of Momphert, duelled with the Andrew, the Viscount of St. Norbert's Isle, duelled in the gardens of Boorwell Manor over a perceived slight earlier that evening over dinner, the details of the imbroglio sadly having gone unrecorded. The Viscount forewarned the Duke, saying: \" Momphert, meet thy end!\" The Duke, his habitual wit not in the slightest dulled by his inebriation, retorted: \" I did so earlier at the pond, dear Norbert. Let me introduce thee to his Lordship!\" At that the Duke heaved a heavy live mallard he had apparently kept hid under the tails of his frock coat at the non-plussed Viscount, hitting him in the chest with a dull thud. Apparently, the Duke himself, in his lively retellings of this tale of jest, would use the sound *duck* to conjure an impression of this thud in his audience's imagination. Ironically, over time it would be exactly the popularity of the Duke himself that erased the cleverness with which he had defeated the Viscount, more surely than any sword would have been able to, from our collective memory, his invented word *Duck* all but replacing the original word in the daily lexicon of most English speakers.

I did n't hear anything, but I was n't not sure if it was because I **couldn't** hear anything, or because there was nothing to hear. That scared me more than anything else. Then, there were the voices. \" **Aq bur bash? **\" What? \" **Hic, bul'nai ima! **\" I could finally open my eyelids, which felt like they weighed more than elephants. My vision was slightly blurry, but I could make out that the lighting was dim, and the room I was in was n't a room, but a cave. A figure looms over me, blocking my vision. I squint, trying to discern a face, but what I see does n't make sense. The figure is a face, mere centimeters from mine, upside down. The face has 4 eyes, black and glassy like an insect's, 2 as large as baseballs on either sides, and 2 smaller ones the size of normal eyes, one on either side situated above the larger ones. The face's mouth has no lips, just a straight black line. The face's skin is light green, mottled with black spots. The face has no nose or ears, just tiny, almost imperceptible holes. The face does have hair, long and shiny, looking closer to glassy mahogany than hair. \" **Opic'al, bur-bur ir? **\" it says. I think it's addressed to me. \" Uh...\" I manage. My tongue feels twice the size that it should be. The inside of my mouth is dry as cotton, and my throat does n't feel much better. The face disappears from my vision momentarily. When it returns, it's farther away, but still above me. \" **Ubik mar-ta-pol, **\" it says to me, gesturing towards something in its hand. I ca n't make it out, but it looks like a gun. I freeze, my heart thumping. Is it going to kill me? It kneels down so that its face is right next to mine. It holds the gun to my neck. \" **Mar-ta-pol, irna terr, **\" it says. I ca n't fight, I ca n't move. I close my eyes, hoping my death will be painless. I hear the click when it pulls the trigger. Instead of a gunshot like I was expecting, a needle shoots out and injects me with something. I'm paralyzed for several seconds, not even being able to blink. Then the figure plucks the needle out of my neck with long, skinny claws. The paralysis wears off, and my tongue seems to be its regular size. My limbs feel heavy, like they're filled with lead, but I can move them. I cautiously sit up, wincing at the pain shooting through my back. The figure, still kneeling next to me, stands up. I look up at it. I can see that it has a long, reed-like neck with protruding obsidian-like spikes, pointing downwards. Its body, which I thought would be like an insect's, is instead closer to a human's. Its body is lean but not overly skinny, and very streamlined. Its legs, though, are what catch my attention. They are long and spry, and so black that my eyes slide off of them. I can only guess at its total height, but I think it might be two or three times taller than me. It seems to be wearing clothes. A baggy jumpsuit of sorts that's dark brown. It stops just short of its legs. It puts another needle into the gun- which I now see is more like an ear piercing gun- and motions towards my neck. I clap my hand over where it just injected me. \" What's in that?\" I demand. It looks at me, unreadable. Its eyes stare at me, wide, and completely un-moving. \" **Arq, pol! Kor'sha, mintu! Bau, **\" it barks at me. Before I can react, it grabs my head and shoves it roughly to the side, exposing my neck. It puts the gun down and uses raises its other arm. \" **Juma inai, **\" it hisses. I do n't know what it's saying, but I'm pretty sure it just threatened to kill me. I go limp, too scared to do anything else. What's happening to me? It picks up the gun again, still pushing my head at an angle. It presses the muzzle of the gun to my jugular vein and presses the trigger. The pain is barely noticeable. It lowers the gun slowly, squinting its eyes at me. After a few seconds, it reluctantly releases my head. \" Can you understand me now?\" it asks. I stare at it, amazed that it can speak English. \" Yeah... where am I?\" I demand, backing away. It makes a strange, gravelly sound that I think is laughter. \" I save your life, and you think I'm going to kill you?\" it says. I can only gape. *What is going on? * It finally calms down, leveling its gaze at me. \" Very well. This must all be disorienting for you. I will tell you where you are, but I warn you, it will be very shocking,\" it says, standing up. It walks to the other end of the small cavern and melts into the shadows. It comes back several seconds later with two stools. It sets a short one on the ground, and unfolds another, much taller one, and puts it at about half a meter away from the first stool. It sits on the short stool, reducing its height by about half. It motions towards the other stool. \" I'd rather you were sitting down for this,\" it hisses. I obediently sit down. I see that it's also holding an electronic pad, like a tablet. It stares at the screen, which lights up on its own. The screen changes several times in the space of two seconds.

{"input": "You're a time traveler sent back in time to stop a wedding. As the ceremony proceeds, it becomes clear that every other guest at the wedding is also a time traveler sent to stop the wedding, but all for different reasons.", "output": "Time travel had its benefits -- you got to get away from your problems, you got to take a free vacation to Spain, you got to witness history in the unmaking. And unmake was exactly what Prinz was going to do -- that was the plan, anyway. He looked through his backpack: a 22nd-century wallet, a unopened manilla envelope containing his mission statement, a good-old-fashioned 2030s electric rapier. Everything was in order, everything would be fine. It was time to wipe Spain off the map. Prinz had no idea why he was doing it. All he knew was that his employer had given him a mission, and if he carried it out he was entitled to open the envelope explaining why. Prinz had considered peeking earlier, but he was a man of his word. And besides, it might interfere with his mission: to disrupt the wedding that unified the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile into the mighty Spanish empire. It wasn't difficult at all to get in. Nobody saw Prinz enter through an open window, and nobody questioned his presence. Confidence, that's all it took. Confidence, historically accurate clothes, seven years dedicated to learning seven dialects of unaccented Spanish. Prinz had all three of those things. Stopping this wedding would be a piece of cake, he thought to himself as he resisted snatching a glass of wine from the table. I'll come back for it later, he smirked. Imagine the profits you could make on wine aged 500 years. But for now he had a mission. He turned the corner and there stood, yes, just like the old diaries said he would, King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Dressed finely, accompanied by two bodyguards, and just as ugly as the portrait made him look. Isabella would be relieved when he died. \" ¿Qué hubo? \" Prinz asked nonchalantly. Immediately the guards gave him a quizzical look. Oh, crap. You can study Spanish all you want, but you'll get stares if you use Chilean slang in Renaissance-era Europe. There was no point in covering it up now -- he was an outsider. \" En garde! \" Prinz shouted as he drew the electric rapier from his bag. He surveyed the room: four doors, all shut; glass ceilings, stained-glass windows, yet no sunlight; vast rows of tables with nice tablecloths and silverware. And, of course, two guards and the target himself, an easy matchup. The guards were pulling out what seemed to be very nice Toledan swords. Clearly they didn't realize what Prinz's weapon was; maybe it was time to show them. Prinz held out his weapon and twisted, cueing the 21st-century devices inside to shoot an arc of lightning out of the tip that traveled eight feet straight into the guard. Taking advantage of the surprise ( or, Prinz mused, the *shock* ), he rushed the other guard with a palpable lack of finesse. The guard was ready, and as Prinz came he sidestepped and tackled Prinz with, he figured, 200 pounds of body weight plus 20 pounds of armor. Wait, tackled? That wasn't a Spanish technique. Prinz craned his head up as much as he could and, indeed, the armor was made of alloys Ferdinand would have given half his kingdom for. \" You're a time traveler too? \" he gasped. At that moment, as if in response, the ceiling shattered and down rained bits of glass and a fellow dressed in highly period-inaccurate kevlar. \" Stop! \" shouted the tackler. He stood up, armor clinking, and nodded his head at the other time travelers. \" It appears we have similar goals. I want to kill Ferdinand for a 100, 000-credit bounty. He paused. \" This is in 2100 credits, so that's more money than you could ever dream of seeing all in one place. \" The poorly-dressed time-traveler looked back at Ferdinand, running like hell away from the outsiders. \" I want to prevent the unification of Spain on behalf of Portugal, to give more power to the crown. 2142, my reward is whatever wealth I desire. \" Prinz staggered to his feet. \" Anthony Prinz, at your service. My reward is unlimited access to my employer's time machine, but I don't know my cause. \" \" You don't know why you're here? \" asked the travelers. \" Well, I have an envelope, \" Prinz mused. He pulled out the envelope from his bag and carefully opened it. White paper, green 24-point Comic Sans, outdated memes from 2020. \" No reason, \" it stated as factually as lime green Comic Sans can, \" you just got trolled. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

We were childhood friends, went to college together, where worked our asses off to get into the financial industry. We became rich, each in our own way. But the stress was often too much, so every few months on a weekend, we would meet, have some fun, then chill out with a beer. Life was good. The elevator ride was almost over, and he pressed a bunch of random buttons just to be an asshole, I'm guessing. John was a prick. Maybe I was one too. We looked like it, with our green and blue shirts and pink and green shorts. We looked like trust fund kids. I was excited. My bonuses had been good, and the hookers were really good this time. Maybe he was just excited like me, and he had a history of doing stupid shit when he was excited. And this was n't even that bad. We had rooms side by side, with lovely escorts waiting inside. The elevator stopped. I had been waiting for this moment for weeks. The door did n't open. I heard a voice saying,'Code accepted'. The elevator started moving up again. I looked at John. He seemed excited, nervous, and almost giddy. He did n't look at me at all. The elevator sped up, went past the 100th floor, with no sign of stopping. Was this a prank? John was capable of doing shit like this. He knew how excited I was. \" John?\" \" Yup.\" \" What the fuck is happening?\" \" Do you remember 9/11, Mike?\" \" Yeah?\" *What? Has he gone mad? There might be a hidden camera somewhere recording me, I'm sure. * \" It's an inside job.\" \" What?\" \" 9/11 was an inside job Mike\" \" What the **fuck** has that got to do with this elevator not stopping?\" The steel elevator stopped. The door still did n't open. The small display said 110.5. Halfway above the hidden 110th floor maybe. This was a really elaborate prank. But his acting gave it away. He should have been just as scared as I was if he had to pull it off. But the screen showing the floor number switched to become camera footage. It seemed like a camera below the elevator in the shaft. I could see the elevator connected by steel cables on the bottom. The shaft was clearly wider than the elevator, so I could see something big projecting out from the bottom of the 110th floor. What the fuck was that? It looked like a big pipe, slightly conical, expanding towards the outside. With a roaring sound, flames burst of that pipe. What the **fuck**. Where the fuck had I seen this pipe looking thing? **A fucking space shuttle afterburner**. It seemed like a miniature version though, made specifically for this purpose. I could start feeling the heat now, and started panicking. \" John, what the hell is happening? Stop this shit.\" He looked at me, with a benign smile. He looked like a guru, as if he knew something which no one else did, and was smiling at our ignorance. \" Stop this man, this is n't funny. Please, what is this?\" Then I went in to grab him, but he help up a gun, and the smile became his cheeky smile of before, and said, \" There, there. I do n't want to hurt you, but I knew you might be shocked. Relax\". How could I relax with an afterburner outside the elevator. But John had a gun. I could n't attempt to do anything. He seemed to have gone mad, and I no longer believed this was a prank. That heat was legit, and we both were sweating now. I tried yanking the ceiling out, but could n't. As soon as it seemed like we were going to die because of the boiling heat, the burner stopped. I looked at the screen. The elevator looked intact. I looked at John.

Not that any of the Ever bodies would know. Adam had spent most of his life in the other half of an Ever Corp facility; from creche to school to offices. Debt in the thirties had reached such a point that a man could not reasonably be expected to pay it off within his lifetime. At first laws were passed, such that debts were passed down, like a pair of long-worn out socks, from father to son. Down through the lines. Imagine turning 18 and finding out you have four generations of debt, interest compounded, just waiting to suck up every last chip on your paycheque each month. All of this put the debt collectors at a bit of disadvantage however if said debtor perished childless. Rear ended by a semi or the classic aneurism at forty; generations of debt, past and future, wiped out in an instant. It would n't do. Adam's father had died on a motorway, fixing a broken axel because he could n't afford a decent repair. Nowadays you need three things to sign a loan; your name, your ID and your blood. Who, where and what you are. So now, when mister bigspender croaks after stuffing half a kilo of co-mex up his nose, Ever Corp ( or one of their subsidiaries ) can keep the bloodline going. Adam's father had never settled down. Never had a kid of his own. It's not slavery. Per se. The kid gets a life, or as much of one as Ever Family Services can provide with all the expenses added to the life debt. And when they turn 18, they start paying. Two things in life used to be certain: death and taxes. Alleviate the former and and reap the latter. To the corporate execs it was a landmark, an infinite supply of workers. Never again would a debt go unpaid. Ever bodies, like Adam, had two numbers in their lives. Their ID and their amount owed. The latter had more numbers than the other. The problem began when the former began to grow. Ever Corp started growing thousands of kids, then millions. Adam had spent his whole life counting down his number. Ever Corp realised the danger of uncontrolled growth, so found a way to kill two birds with one stone. Well, really it was killing one bird, but you got lots of stones out of it. The average human body is worth about two million chips. You've got the organs, tissue and the like. A healthy set of lungs still beat the best prosthetics for now. Throw in the carbon offset from removing yourself from the atmosphere and Ever Corp will happily write off the last percentage of your debt.

A fear that, even after eons of evolution, persists as primal instinct. But mankind persisted. And as mankind grew, our numbers dwindled. We retreated, having long realized that they were to be the dominant species. We fled, but mankind followed. Always pushing us back. The same fear we instilled in humans took hold of us, and we fled deeper and deeper into the wild. We are the watchers. We are the Sasquatch.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He finally calibrates it to a deep, milky timber. I make a face. \" I do n't have a physical ideal! That's not how I work!\" \" Just try me out,\" he smiles, the planes of his face shifting, defining and redefining his features, until a distinct visage begins to form. A strong refined jaw, a high brow, a straight Roman nose, deep set eyes that are alarmingly blue, and a supple pout that curls into a wicked grin. Thick black locks begin to cascade down the sides of his face. I watch him speechlessly. He gives me a flirtatious grin and looks down, beckoning me to watch his body transform from the flat standard model to a toned, broad-shouldered torso with thick curvaceous thighs. He's completely naked. Twelve hours ago I had received an nondescript male humanoid robot in the mail. It looked like a fleshed-out stick figure at the time. I started it up, curious as to how it worked, but knowing full well that whatever happened would not satisfy me. I would immediately send him back. The figure sat on my couch loading for nine hours and scanning the room. Finally, once it had finished loading, it began to embody more human features, so it resembled a sort of mannequin. It then asked for a name. Already I did n't like the idea of deciding on the name of my \" perfect lover.\" My complete control over the process felt fraudulent. However I could n't proceed without naming him. After some pondering, I settled on the name Theo. \" Am I not what you want?\" he grins. \" Well... you're... definitely attractive.

{"input": "You are out stargazing on a quiet night. Suddenly you see a flash of light from the moon as one of its main thrusters starts up.", "output": "When you are nearer the end of your life than the beginning, you tend to see things differently. There is wonder wherever we turn if we are willing to see it. In the nature around us, in the people we share our lives with, in the *mysteries* of life. I tipped the bottle and poured the pale gold liquid into the glass, gave it a little shake and brought it to my lips. It smells exotic like an orange grove and tastes sublime, like macadamia nuts and vanilla, with a hint of sandalwood and black cherry. Good whisky. I pour another glass and walk onto my porch with it, settling into my chair on the deck of my home. Martha was out with friends and it feels good to sit outside in the nighttime and unwind after a long day at the University. The quiet solitude of simply watching the stars is the best way to relax. I've been gazing at the night sky since I was a boy, hypnotised by this brilliant tapestry of light. Time bends our memories but I allow myself a small indulgence and smile at my earliest memory of the stars. As I looked for the first time and truly wondered, *what are they*, I saw one streak across the sky in the blink of an eye. My father told me it was a shooting star if I made a wish it would come true. I wished that I could spend every night looking out into this bewildering display of colour and know everything about it. In a way, my wish did come true, at least partly. I became an astrophysicist and spent my entire life investigating the stars, desperate to learn their secrets and share their magic. I fell in love, but my greatest passion was reserved not for a star, but the planet like asteroid we call the moon. It captivated me. To this very day I can not look at our moon without a sense of awe. It should n't be there, but there it is, a nightly reminder to my learned colleagues who falsely assume mastery of our field when the truth is we know little and can be sure of even less. I take a sip of the whisky and look up at the secretive canvas of stars, stretching out into infinity. Light which has travelled the expanse of the universe, is billions of years old and seen more than we could ever comprehend, is captured by my eyes at this exact moment and presents a unique moment in history. You will never see the same sky twice, everything is in a state of transition and each moment should be treasured forever. When you blink, it is gone. Energy flows like a river through the fabric of space and time, creating, destroying, rebuilding, changing. We are all made of stardust. To an astrophysicist, or the mildly curious, nothing is as it seems. And yet we live our lives bound by the mundane and ignorant of all around us. Perhaps, one day, an event will happen which will shake the unsound foundations of our society and force us to stand up and take notice. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man these days. I chuckle at my self reflection, *I am a grumpy old man*, but there is still truth to these musings. We can only see the stars from our own galaxy with our naked eye, and even then only about five thousand in all. Because the earth itself gets in the way, we can only see roughly half of those from where we are at any time. Who are we? How did we get here? There are so many questions, yet so few answers. I have my suspicions for some of life's big questions but to share them would ruin my career. I'm too close to the end now to throw it all away and become an object of ridicule. I ponder a lifetime's work as I sip my expensive whisky, sitting on my favorite chair on the deck of my home where I have lived for more than thirty years. One minute the kids were young children, playing on the garden before me, the next they are adults pursuing their our journey, finding their own answers to their own questions. The moon draws my attention, as it always does. For what feels like the millionth time I have the same thought, you should n't be there. The prevailing wisdom suggests our moon was formed after something big, probably a planet the size of Mars, collided with earth billions of years ago, the resulting debris from the collision formed the moon. It's a perfectly reasonable theory, that kind of thing happened all the time as our solar system was being formed, happens to this very day all over the universe. That's not how our moon was formed though, at least not to my way of thinking and I know a little about these matters. It was *placed* there. Precisely and exactly to the smallest calculated degree, right *there* next to us in that exact spot. It sounds crazy, trust me when I say I know how ludicrous it sounds, but the evidence is clear, the moon is anything but a natural satellite. It would take me a very long time, and for you to grasp the subtleties of astrophysics, as well as bypass everything you have ever been told about the universe to convince you the moon is not a natural object. But it's not, it's undeniably *alien*. I'm an advanced mathematician, I work with impossibly large numbers every day. Numbers can not lie, they have no agenda and they reveal everything to one who takes the time to understand them. Mathematics is the only universal language. Nobody would believe my theory even though the evidence is scientific, measured and irrefutable. I'm not the first to say the moon is n't what we think it is. It's what I think it is that really concerns me and for a time I promised myself I would never think of this again. It was impossible. I think our moon is a *spaceship*. I do n't know how, what, where, when, why or who put that moon in our sky, but someone, or *something* did. It would make the perfect interstellar craft, capable of withstanding immense pressure and heat. Alarmingly, it would also make a perfect surveillance platform if you wanted to covertly monitor life on a planet. You could *hide* in plain sight. Suddenly, a bright flash turns night into day and a second later it is gone. I am flash blind, like an annoying photographer has fired his expensive camera directly into my face. I rub my eyes and try to blink it away. It happens again and I notice the light is coming from the moon. I still have the whiskey in my hand, the glass drops and smashes into a thousand fragments across the deck. I do n't even notice the broken glass as I launch myself up from the chair. I watch the moon disappear from the night sky like the shooting star of my childhood and I realise with a sense of unease that nothing will ever be the same again.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The administrators were becoming more worried with each explosion. FBI investigations turned up no pattern or discernible connection between each explosion, but the targets were all too important, too well timed. The first had gone off near a power sub station outside of Chicago, effectively knocking out clean water to the entire city. The second car bomb had taken out another electrical plant that fed power to Phoenix during the hottest days of the year. A third car bomb, less than two days later, did a tremendous amount of damage to a hydroelectric dam on the Great Lakes that was part of the over complex New England power grid. The resulting hiccup and power surge from a hasty repair ended up making New York City dark for nine hours. The fourth explosion turned off Washington DC metro systems at the peak of rush hour, causing widespread chaos and annoyance. The last bomb had managed to darken LA's most vital airport hub. And, mythically, there had never been a direct casualty of the explosions. It was all so surgical and random. Somebody was throwing rocks at the house without any real plan it looked, while at the same time each strike appeared so wildly planned that the board of Moderators could n't help but marvel at the ease with which it seemed to be carried out time and time again.

The Middle East is a warzone so people losing their minds a little bit there makes plenty of sense, but that's only going to last so long.\" \" How long will the Russian Mods keep this up,\" pushed the President, \" I can only keep those vodka swearing'blyat bots'amused so long with the games we're playing around their territory. The distractions on the US servers wont last forever, especially if we're getting hounded like this.\" \" Could it *be* a Russian? * Asked the Mod of the National Security Agency \" Doubtful,\" replied the Energy Secretary, \" The targeting seems to be testing what we can do. this last explosion was their most daring yet. And all the footage of the surrounding areas is completely worthless. It's as if there is a ghost causing things to blow up.\" The building rumbled and lights dimmed. A backup generator hummed into life and lights returned to normal. The TV at the back of the room blinked from the seal of the Presidency and was suddenly filled with a still framed image of a Guy Fawkes mask. \" GOOD MORNING, MODS!\" A voice exploded from the speakers. The avatars of the moderators all stood and glared at one another, each looking to blame the next for the lapse in security to their servers.

The launch sequences were initiated. \" But the other bombings...\" The CIA avatar was dejected, \" What was the point?\" There was a pause in communications as the count down nearly reached zero before the voice replied, almost sounding as though they were on the verge of bursting into laughter, \" I WAS GOING TO DRAW A DICKBUTT OVER THE US, BUT THIS SEEMED FASTER.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

However, it is not this I am writing about today- it is my concern that your Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is probably not qualified to teach the class. This \" Merasmus\" character, as he calls himself, not only blatantly disregards the dress code ( by wearing a ram's skull on his head and covering up the majority of his face ), has no indoor voice whatsoever, but also is apparently a PRACTITIONER of the Dark Arts. He has distributed a copy of the \" Bombinomicon\" to everyone in Neville's class, which as you know, is a repository of many spells and curses that relate to demolition and belongs only in the Restricted Section- not distributed willy-nilly to the students! And my grandson, on top of it, often finds it difficult to sleep because it is whispering into his ear at night. Not only is the new professor lacking in moral stamina, but he is also lacking in practical magical knowledge. His spells and incantations ( if they are not explosive-related ) either result in completely random effects ( including, as Neville tells me, jars of urine raining down on everyone in the vicinity ) or are completely ineffective. \" Babmo-Bib-Brondo\" is not a spell, it is complete gobbledegook! He knew nothing of the Disarming or Shielding Charms and actually Transfigured a student's head into a bomb once- the entire class had to visit Madame Pomfrey afterwards, and it was a miracle that nobody was killed. How the student whose head was turned into a bomb survived I may never understand. Not only that, he is bringing Muggles and rabid animals onto school grounds. Neville was going to confront Merasmus in his office about his ineffective teaching methods, but he was quickly accosted by a feral, sour-cream stinking American in an army helmet and red battle fatigues, in addition to a snarling and foaming raccoon. Tom Jones was also there, but that's of minor importance. As Merasmus complained about the American's frequent interference in his life choices, Neville had to leave because the raccoon and \" soldier\" started to snarl and bite at him. Most of this incompetence and outright disregard for authority I can and did overlook. My grandson, after all, is still doing tolerably in the class, was acting leader of Dumbledore's Army and killed Voldemort's foul snake, so I know that he is adequately trained. He can protect himself, and the entire class besides. But it was what happened about a month after term start that motivated me to write this. At 10:00 in the morning, my grandson, and apparently everyone in Hogwarts heard various explosions and insults in the Great Hall. When they went to get a closer look, what did him and the rest of the students find? Muggles, including that American lout, shooting each other with their strange metal wands and attacking Merasmus! Not only is this a blatant breach of the Statute of Secrecy, but a safety risk to the students. Merasmus, in fact, cast a spell that rained bombs down on everyone, causing craters and smoke to erupt everywhere! It was only the quick thinking of the professors ( disapparating those closest to the explosions ) that saved many of the students from the falling explosives- and even then, Pomfrey was overworked for a week mending the ruptured eardrums, broken ribs and concussions. To add insult to injury, afterwards they could n't even eat in the Great Hall- the house-elves were too busy repairing the splintered benches and plastering the holes in the wall! And do n't get me started on the time Merasmus tried to invoke some sort of Sumerian circus god around Halloween. Those idiots came back and started shooting up the castle again.

I do n't want their thanks. I do n't want the recognition. I do n't want... the reminder about what occurred just a few days ago. But I ca n't forget. It's a memory I know will haunt me forever. My brother and I were orphans growing up, I one year older than him. Our mother raised us as best she could by herself, our father walked out on us when my brother was born, apparently we were too much trouble for him. With only her to support the whole family, we quickly fell into poverty, and if that was n't enough, she got horribly sick. At the ripe age of nine and eight, my brother and I lost our only parent and became orphans. It was hard growing up. We were first sent to the city orphanage for a few years. No decent potential parents wanted to adopt us both, so we were there for awhile; so long in fact that the other orphans that came and went made fun of us for it. I had thick skin and ignored it, but it was all I could do to stop my brother from getting into fist fights. Eventually we were adopted. They were n't the nicest parents, think of Count Olaf from the Series of Unfortunate Events. They only adopted the both of us for the bigger tax breaks. It was n't the greatest environment to grow up under for those next few years. While I coped with it, trying to make the best of it, it was hard to control my brother; he got in trouble a lot and hung out with lowlifes, doing all sorts of illegal things. Still, I covered for him whenever I could, he was my younger brother after all. Going to school did n't really help much either, at least for him. While I did my best, overcame the bullies, got friends, and knew that soon I would be free to live my own life, my brother was the opposite. He slacked off his schoolwork, fought the bullies like back then, was a loner, and constantly complained that he would be stuck there with all these terrible people who made his life awful... I tried to talk to him, get it through his head that he could change his fate if he just tried, but he would n't listen to me, said that I was one of \" them\", the ones who made his life a living hell... I did n't know what to do and I could only wonder if his behavior would ever stop... And so the day came... I was walking into school alone, intent on talking to my girlfriend before 1st period. We had been dating for two years and now, as seniors, had both decided to go to the same college which we both had been accepted into. As I caught a glimpse of her waiting for me at my locker in the main common area, I see her eyes and those of our classmates around her widen and look past me. I spin around and see my brother walk through the doors of the school, wearing a black trench coat, wool cap, and combat boots along with his torn jeans. But that was n't what drew the wide eyes. It was the Uzi in his hands. \" Oh shi-\" I started to say, just before he raised the gun and shot up into the ceiling. In an instant everyone started panicking, running around and screaming. I stood there frozen in shock as people bumped past me. All I could see was the crazed grin on my brothers face as he looked around at everyone. I was shaken from my stupor when another few shots went off and there were screams of pain. I saw a few students, the \" popular\" ones that were at the most fault for our bulletins on the past, laying on the tiled floor, blood oozing from the bullet wounds on their legs and such. Apparently your brother did n't want to outright kill anyone... not yet anyway. \" Come on! We have to hide!\" My girlfriend shouted at me, and pushed me behind the lockers where a lot of other students were hiding. I crouched down and looked around to watch my brother. He took a few more shots, injuring a few more people, all the while with that maniacle grin. Eventually, the common area was quiet and clear, except of course the few injured and moaning students laying on the floor. \" Well now, I certainly think that's a START. Now maybe you assholes can begin to understand the pain you put me through over the years. Sure, most of it was emotional and mental harassment, but I think physical payback is a decent equivalent.\" My brother said loudly so everyone could hear him. \" Now, could you all make this easy on me? If you bullied me EVER, and you know who you are, then come out and face your punishment. If you do n't... then it's the innocent who gets it.\" Everyone around me looked terrified and I was right along with them. How could this happen? How could I let this happen? Why could n't I see this coming? As I looked at my girlfriend across the way, along with other students who were frozen with fear, I knew I had to do something to stop him... I was his brother, so... he would n't hurt me, right? With that little chance, I stood up, ignoring those around me trying to pull me back, and I walked around my cover and towards my brother. \" Ah! I was wondering where you were!\" My brother exclaimed with a cackle. \" I was sort of hoping you would n't be around, but I should've known you'd be here on time.\" I stared at him long and hard before taking a deep breath. \" You need to stop this. Right now.\" I said, glad my voice did n't break from fear. His smile turned to a frown. \" And why would I do that? I'm just getting started, and I need to punish more people. The people that hurt US.\" He growled at me. I shook my head. \" No. This is n't right. Hurting these people like this wo n't solve anything! And if you do n't stop right now it's going to end up even worse for you than it already is right now! I wo n't be able to protect you then!\" He snarled at me. \" PROTECT me! Go to hell! You're almost as bad as the rest of these monsters! You got the grades, the friends, the girl! You left me behind!\" I cringed because there was a semblance of truth there. Focusing and acquiring those things in my life made me focus less time for my brother, something I felt guilt for, but also anger. \" I tried! I tried to help you! But no matter what I said, no matter what I did, you just kept going back to the same old habits! I had to start looking after myself too! I wanted something out of life.\" He stewed with my words for a minute, glaring at me the whole time. I took this chance to slowly inch myself closer to him. \" And you think I did n't? I want the things you have too! But thanks to these assholes I am who I am.\" He pointed the gun at the injured teenagers around them. \" They were wrong with their bullying, that is true... but this is not the answer. You should n't let them decide who you are... that's all on you.\" I said, still inching closer. He seemed to think about it for a second before shouting out angrily. \" NO! I have nothing and it's their fault! They deserve what's coming for them!\" He pointed his gun at the nearest injured teen and was about to pull the trigger, but I had gotten close enough to jump at him, tackling him to the ground. We wrestled for the gun, the barrel pointing this way and that. Eventually I got behind him and had my arm around his throats and the other holding him back from shooting the injured teenagers. We struggled as he looked around, his eyes wide and mad. Suddenly he locked onto something and strained even harder. I looked over to see that he had a clear shot at my girlfriend hiding in the corner. \" If I ca n't have what you have... then neither can you!\" He gasped out, and pulled the trigger. Bullets starting flying at the wall just feet from my girlfriend, and she screamed. My eyes widened as I struggled to hold back his arm, and the bullets slowly got closer to her, she was trapped. \" Stop!\" I shouted desperately, knowing that I could n't hold him back forever. The bullets flew ever closer to her as she backed against the wall as much as she could. \" Never!\" My brother growled, and kept straining against my hold. The bullets peppered the wall only a foot away from her and she screamed. My heart nearly shattered because I knew what I had to do. I could n't let her die... I loved her. \" Please.\" I whispered, by my brother heard me. \" The only way to stop me, is to-\" I yanked his head back, there was a crack, and his body fell lifeless in my arms. \" I know.\" End Death scene inspired by Man of Steel movie.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I stopped writing in my notebook and got up. \" Jennnnnnnaaaaaa --\" \" I'm right here, jeez.\" I complain, hurrying out into the living room. My roommate, Lisa, grinned brightly at me. She was covered in grime -- no surprise, considering our jobs -- and holding up two pristine white cards. \" You wo n't believe what I won today!\" \" Rent money?\" \" Better!\" \" I honestly ca n't think of anything better than rent money.\" \" Then you're not trying!\" Lisa pouted. \" You remember the lottery at your job a month ago?\" I frowned. \" I do n't remember anything that happened a month ago. Well, I guess we paid rent a month ago, but --\" \" Stop thinking about rent! I'm talking about the Another Me program!\" \"...\" I thought hard. Another Me had sponsored something at my job, I recalled that much. \"... I do remember something like that.\" Lisa grinned. \" They sponsored my job too and -- Look! I won the cards!\" \" Oh. To do what?\" \" To visit our alternate universe selves!\" She cried, seeming fed up with me. \" Ah. And this is n't all smoke and mirrors? Like that Total Recall place about... ten or so years ago? It's not like that right? Where it's all complete bull?\" \" Did n't Total Recall work too well?\" \" I do n't know, I just remember it had to be shut down.\" \" Jenna. Do you NOT want the card? I could give it to someone else. Steve. Leeanna.\" \" I do want it.\" I said, hurriedly. \" I'm just skeptical, that's all. I ca n't ask questions?\" \"... Well, do n't ask ME questions.\" Lisa said, putting the cards on the side table. \" I'm gon na take a shower. We can redeem the cards when you get off of work tomorrow.\" \" You do n't have work?\" \" No, I do. But I took the day off because I wanted to do this thing!\" Lisa said, hurring to the bathroom before I got a word in edgewise. I waited for her to turn on the water before I picked up one of the cards. It was thin and light. When tilted, you could read \" Another Me\" in some holographic ink on it. It was n't a regular card, it was one of the special key cards that required imprinting to be fully read. Lisa had already applied her fingerprint to one, rendering it illegible to me. The other one was pristine and perfect. All I had to do was press my finger into some of the DNA Imprinting ink and press it to the card, and it would show me more information. What information, I wondered, could a place like Another Me need to hide? I had work in two hours... there was no reason to think too hard about it. It was probably just a scheme for rich people to get richer, like some kind of snake oil. I set the card back down and headed back to my room. ______ Work was as grueling as ever. To make us less irritable, they projected a blue sky image onto the ceiling of the facility. It's weird because the sky has n't been blue for... decades? I've never seen a real blue sky, but I'm sure my parents might've. Steve worked this job with me, and I chatted with him like always. Apparently, Lisa had already told him about her win. \" So Lisa won, did you hear? She said she was going to take you to Another Me!\" Steve shouted over the cauldron's loud noises. \" You guys are lucky! Another Me is really cool!\" \" You've been?\" I shouted back. \" Oh, yeah! Tons of times!\" \" Is n't it kind of expensive?\" \" It is, yeah! But my other self is doing the job I wanted to do, and I just want to know what that's like!\" I pondered this as Steve and I started turning the crank to mix the molten metal in our cauldron. What if my alternate universe me because a chef, like I'd wanted? I would n't want to go see them again. Steve was punishing himself by returning. \" Hey, what's the mixture like?\" Steve asked. I checked my screen. \" It looks like we're low on phosphorous,\" I told him. \" I'll put in a request.\" I touched the order button on the screen and we continued mixing. There were about twenty other cauldrons like ours in this area, so I was n't expecting to get the phosphorous anytime soon. \" Lisa got really lucky,\" Steve shouted again. \" I wish I'd won those tickets!\" I shrugged. If Steve did n't think it was so bad, then maybe it was n't? ______ Lisa was impatient by the time I got out of the shower. Steve had convinced me that the experience was worth while, but not that it was real. I mean, Steve's dream job was owning ERTHMobile, which is crazy. Steve owning any company other than ERTHMobile made more sense than that. ERTHMobile ran almost every single transportation service off of Earth. For Steve -- who had n't graduated from college, like myself and Lisa -- to make it there, he must've won at least seven lotteries in that world. \" Hurry up! Have you imprinted on the card yet?\" Lisa complained through the door when I turned off the water. A gust of hot air hit me as the drying cycle began. \" What? Oh, right. Are they open at 5?\" I asked, glancing over at the pristine card sitting on the edge of the sink. \" What? I mean... yeah. No? I do n't know!\" \" Check your card!\" I told her. I turned off the drying and stepped out of the shower, picking up a T-shirt I wore to sleep. \" I've got like two hours before they open, right? I can take a nap... right?\" \" Ugh! Fine! They open at 8.\" \" See, so it's 3 hours. I'm going to take a nap.\" \" Imprint first!\" Lisa whined. \" I want to know what your card says!\" \" Why? What does yours say?\" \" It just tells you how many alternate universe versions of you exist. There are five of me.\" \" Really...?\" I murmured. \"... Steve only talked about one of him.\" \" Yeah, you can have a varying number of them.\" Lisa said. \" Steve's other one lives in a world similar to ours, but I kind of hope mine does n't. What about you, Jenna?\" \" Dunno. A different world would be nice.\" \" There's ink in there, just imprint already!\" \" OK, OK.\" I complained. I rooted around in the bathroom until I found the DNA Imprinting ink, and then I imprinted on the card. My finger print swirled as the card loaded my data, and then finally took the shape of a number. 0. ______ I lied to Lisa about it. I figured the card just malfunctioned. So when we got to Another Me, I did exactly what Lisa did. I walked up the the front desk and I showed the clerk there my card. The young woman put on a visor to read the cards and scanned Lisa's card, but balked at mine. She took the visor off and rebooted it and looked at the card again. \" Is something wrong?\" Lisa asked. \" Ah. Yes, this card seems to be defective...\" The clerk said. \" I'll see if I can get you a replacement, Miss Black.\" \" OK.\" I said. \" That sucks...\" Lisa murmured. She seemed impatient. I could n't blame her, we barely got any vacation time. \" You can go ahead, Lisa,\" I said. \" It wo n't take too long, right?\" The clerk shook her head. \" Just go through these gates and straight down the hall. There'll be someone waiting for you,\" Seeming happy enough, Lisa went through the white gates leading furthering into the facility. The clerk made a phone call and shortly after Lisa left, a new white card printed from the clerk's console. \" Sorry about the wait. Please...\" She pushed some ink towards me. \" Imprint.\" I did as she said. The number came up again. 0. She stared. \" Oh.\" She said. Clearly this was her first time seeing a 0. \" Let me call an engineer...\" She said. \" This is... hmm.\" I waited as she called someone else. This time, a hologram projected from her console. \" Hi.\" The man in the hologram said. \" I'm David Henry.\" \" Jenna Black.\" I introduced myself. \" Nice to meet you.\" \" Same here!\" David said. \" So Leah says you keep getting a 0 on your cards? Can I ask if you have a history of disease in your family?\" \" I do not.\" \" Hmm.\" David started typing on something that was n't in the hologram. \" And can I ask if you were recently paroled for anything?\" \" No. And I've never been to prison.\" \" Alright, and are you currently pregnant?\" \" No.\" David nodded. \" Alright. Another card should be printing now...\" As he spoke, a card printed from the console. \" Please, try again.\" I imprinted. The card came up with the same number. 0. \" What is it, Leah?\" David asked. \"... 0.\" She said, her voice hushed. \" What the hell... alright, let her through. Jenna, you'll be going to a special room.\" \" Uh...\" I started. \" I do n't really mind not doing this, but --\" David shook his head. \" I insist.\" I wanted to say no, but Leah had pressed a button and a robot took my hand and pulled me away, to a room with an unlabeled door. Inside, there was a large complicated chair based console, which the robot lead me to. It waited until I sat down to leave. When the door closed, the chair turned on. 9 pictures of me appeared before my eyes, and over each one a text bar read \" Searching...\" and, after a couple of seconds, in all caps and bold, in blinking read text, each of them read \" DEAD\". A pre-recorded hologram popped up. \" Another Me would like to apologize for this inconvenience. We promised that we could put you in touch with copies of yourself from other universes, but we're going to have to give your money back. According to our sources, communication is impossible.

{"input": "The Forbidden Pages...", "output": "Lily loved working in the shop. Not writing price tags - that was annoying. But everything else about it. The smell of old paper. The muffled hush, so quiet you could almost hear your own heartbeat. She even liked Mr. Solomon, with his strange accent and his odd stories about exotic places. \" I found toads with diamonds on their backs in Turkey,\" he'd tell her. Or \" the Egyptian Pharaohs could speak with crocodiles.\" She did n't know how much of what he told was true, of course. It could all have been nonsense. But in the bookshop, surrounded by that weight of words, everything Mr. Solomon said sounded wise and important. It was only supposed to be a summer job, something to earn her a little money before going off to university. But Lily found herself putting off her studies again and again, happy working in the small shop. Besides, Mr. Solomon said that there was more learning in books than in a hundred universities. So each time she was supposed to be applying for courses, Lily instead was deep in some dusty old book, reading about other lands and other worlds. In her third year of working there, Mr. Solomon began to give her more responsibility. He gave her a key, so that she could open and close the shop each day. He showed her how to work the register, and let her sell books as well as stack them. And on days when his knees were troubling him, he sent her into the attic to gather more stock. It was on one of these restocking expeditions that Lily found the box. She'd climbed the rickety ladder up to the attic, coughing at the dust. Now she was standing on bare floorboards, surrounded by crates and crates of books. None of these books had been on the shop floor, ever, but all of them had a price tag. All of them, except the ones in the box. Every book in the shop had a price tag. Prices ranged from fifty pence ( for the battered second-hand romance books, kept in a bin by the door ) to several thousand pounds. The valuable books, mostly bound in leather, were kept in a special locked case, right next to Mr. Solomon's chair. If someone wanted to examine one of those books more closely, Mr. Solomon would lock the shop up, close the curtains, and unlock the case with the iron key that hung around his neck. But even those books, incalculably valuable and only handled when Mr. Solomon was right there, had a price tag. That was the rule - Mr. Solomon was very strict on that. \" Every book should be marked clearly with exactly - exactly - what it is worth\" he said, several times a day in his old creaky voice. He said it whenever new books came in, and Lily had to spend hours looking up the precise value on the exchange. He said it whenever a book became damaged, or something fluctuated on the exchange, and Lily had to hunt the shelves to adjust a price up or down. Every book, with no exceptions, had to have a price. That was the second thing that interested Lily about the box. None of the books inside it had any label at all. The first thing she had noticed was the box itself. Unlike the plain pine crates that filled the rest of the attic, this box was made of some dark yellow-brown wood. As she pulled the box out from its place in the corner, where it had been tucked as far out of the way as possible, she smelled a strange spice; it made her think of the distant lands that Mr. Solomon mentioned, places she had never seen and thought she never wood. The wood was smooth, unvarnished but shaped and sanded until there were no sharp edges or splinters. The lid lifted easily up, easing back on its hinges without a creak. Inside the box were the books. Instantly, she could tell that these were the kind of books that would go in the cabinet, safely locked away from the general public. That meant she should put the box back - the cabinet was full at the moment, they did n't need valuable books today. But these books looked old and interesting. Besides, they did n't have a price tag, and that was reason enough to look at them. Lily decided to delay her return downstairs, just for a little while. None of the books had titles, either on the front or spine. She picked up each one slowly, handling them all before opening any. Most of the books were leather-bound, though there were some that were more unusual. One book was made of something like rice paper, dry and almost crumbly to the touch. Several seemed to be made of a coarse light brown paper that she could almost swear was papyrus. One book felt like leather, but no kind she'd ever come across before; it was a pale yellowy colour, with dark patterns swirling across it that seemed to be part of the leather, not something added later. There were twenty books in the box. Twenty books of wildly different sizes and bindings. Twenty books without titles. Twenty books that shared nothing except age, and a total lack of pricing. Twenty mysteries waiting to be explored. At random, Lily picked up one of the books. A leather one, one of the more normal-looking ones. Slowly, she opened the book, careful not to damage the spine. Dense, closely written text met her eyes. Slowly, she spelt out the spidery text: \" De... vermis... myster-\" It was n't in English. Latin or German or something. Something she did n't know. She put down the book. Disappointingly, the rest of the books followed a similar pattern. Book after book was in an unfamiliar language. The rice-paper one, unsurprisingly, was in some Asian script. The yellow leather was Arabic, perhaps? It looked like her idea of what Arabic was. The final book was smaller than the others. Dark blue leather, with a stylized golden image of a key on the front. It felt warm, as though it had just left a warm room, not been left in a cold attic. Despite the failures of the other nineteen books, Lily felt a brief spark of hope that this one, out of all of them, would mean something to her. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- *I am continuing this, I just thought I'd throw the first bit out there now, see if anyone is interested. *", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Staring at a pane of glass, the prisoner whispered \" You know I did n't do it.\" With that, he sat back down into the lone chair in his cell and continued to eat. Nonchalantly.

The other stared at the man in the cell for a little while longer. Was it possible...? No, he concluded. The jury had spoken, and that, he decided, was that. That evening, a man died on a chair.

Edward had always wondered when she would show up. Would it be a chance meeting while waiting for a bus or getting a cup of coffee? Or would it be more of a golden destiny moment, straight out of a movie: The two of them on a street late at night, the golden-halo glow of the streetlamps illuminating the world around them with a bit too much saturation, when they both look up and notice they are walking toward each other. Time slows down as he loses focus on the act of moving and is just aware of a magnetic attraction to the only other human in front of him. It's her, and she knows it. His vision becomes suddenly sharp and nostalgically fuzzy at the same time. At last, she is right in front of him. They both stop walking. He goes to speak at the same time. They both mutter the beginning syllables and then stop. She blushes, then says, \" I'm sorry, you first. \" WHACK. A piece of crumpled notebook paper hit Edward in the head. He sat upright with a jolt. \" Dreaming about her again? \" asked Jay, who sat in the cubicle next to Edward. \" No….I was just…..well, yes. \" stammered Edward as he began to blush \" You're such a hopeless romantic, \" Jay said. He focused his eyes on his computer screen while reaching his right hand for his mouse. The top of the words'I'm sorry'stuck out of his sleeve. Edward sighed, \" It's so easy for you Jay, you've already found your soulmate. You and Renee met years ago. You've got kids and a house. Hell, you've even got a red golden retriever. Seems picture perfect to me. \" \" Sure it looks good Ed, \" replied Jay, \" but it's just life. It's not like I'm bursting at the seams with contentment every day, smiling all the way to work and then all the way home. If anything, my life is full of more and more things each day that I'm responsible for. It's great that Ren is there to help but honestly I'd rather have less to worry about. The whole soulmate thing is great and all, but it feels to me more like some sort of contrived government conspiracy to keep everyone complacent than an altruistic divination of human experience. \" \" Sounds to me like you've become more complacent, \" mumbled Edward as he turned around in his seat. He didn't have to look at Jay's wrist to know that the words that once stood out in a deep, dark crimson had almost completely faded from his skin. That's what always happened after you had found your soulmate, your one, your imzadi. Your spoke the words to each other and watched the dawn of realization in each others eyes upon hearing the words that they each had read their entire lives were finally spoke to them. Words that had been written before they could be understood. Words that were imbued with more meaning that any other words in their entire life. Edward blinked. \" Maybe I am a hopeless romantic…. \" he said as his mind once again drifted away. The sky he pictured now was a bright blue. A golden sun sat perched halfway behind a cloud, illuminating the great green field where he sat on a large blanket, reading a book. He looked a little bit thinner than normal, which wasn't really something that he felt was a bad thing. The Edward in this daydream read intently when suddenly a frisbee whizzed right in front of him, knocking his book out of his hand and dropping to the ground a few feet away. \" What the hell? \" he said as he stood up and walked over to the now stationary items. He was vaguely aware of another figure running toward him and then reaching for the frisbee. They both leaned forward to grab their items off of the ground at the same time and hit each other in the head. Pulling back they started to chuckle while rubbing their foreheads at the same time. \" I'm sorry, \" she said, \" you first. \" \" EDWARD! \" Edward once again sat up with a jolt. Jay was standing at the edge of his cubicle with his jacket on and briefcase in hand. \" Come back to reality bud. Time to go home, \" he said. \" Right. Have a good weekend Jay, \" Edward replied automatically. \" You too man, \" said Edward as he turned and walked toward the elevator. Edward turned off his computer. He pushed his chair back and stood up. He grabbed his coat and put it on. Finally he put a few loose papers into his filing cabinet, grabbed his briefcase and headed to the elevator. The elevator door opened and he walked in. A very attractive red-haired woman in a royal blue dress was staring at the wall as he turned around and pressed the'G'button. He wondered if this would be it. So seemingly innocuous, yet etched with subtle perfection. The way the hemline of her blue dress held her calf in a gentle embrace… \" Excuse me? \" the woman said. Edward choked and coughed. \" I'm sorry? \" he stammered. \" You just said'the hemline of her blue dress held her calf in a gentle embrace'\" she spoke, slightly agitated. \" \" What kind of creeper are you, \" she questioned, \" Are you talking about me? \" \" No..um... I was..uh…..just thinking about... uh.. \" Edward stammered again. \" Stay away from me you freak, \" she said as the elevator came to a halt and the doors opened. She exited the elevator and left Edward standing in embarrassment. He meekly followed her into the lobby. He pretended to answer a call on his cell phone while she was walking out the front doors. After waiting a few minutes to make sure that she was a few blocks away, Edward walked out into the dreary, rainy August afternoon. He headed to the corner store that was a few storefronts away, in hopes that they hadn't sold out of their daily supply of diet cream soda. He opened the door and immediately had a large revolver shoved into his face. Edward froze. In front of him stood a person, slightly shorter than him, wearing baggy jeans, an over sized black hoodie and a tight black hockey mask. This person also happened to be pointing a gun directly at his head. Edward saw nothing else. From behind the gun holder came a jumble of movement. Edward then saw the torso of the cashier fall to the counter with his head facing the back of the store. Blood was beginning to pool underneath of him. A voice screamed from behind the counter, \" Did someone just walk in the door? I thought I told you to lock it! \" A figure dressed in the same manner as the gun holder rounded the corner from behind the counter and walked up to stand side by side with his shorter accomplice. The expectant weapon twitched a bit. \" He's seen too much, shoot him, \" a gruff, manly voice said from under his ski mask. The world was very loud and then very quiet. For Edward reality took on a hazy glow and a strange bit of tilt. He then noticed that he was watching the two masked individuals taking off their baggy clothes and removing their masks. The man had a strange, pock-marked face. The removal of the second mask revealed a woman with short blonde hair. She was glancing at Edward with a sullen expression, but it never once slowed her determined costume change. Seconds became minutes and then hours and then years. Eons flowed as Edward watched the couple. The lady bent down and moved a piece of Edward's hair that had over fallen in front of his field of vision. \" I'm sorry, \" she said. She stood up and nodded to the man with her. She then opened the door and motioned for him to walk out. \" You first. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Tonight was the night Joseph had been waiting for for years and years. Tonight he became a father. Tonight he would grant himself his next of kin and begin the next steps of his life. Together, they would raise a beautiful, successful boy. They laid in the darkness for what seems like eons. Both breathing heavily, both so unsure of what to do next, the energy in the air crackling around them like sparks from a fire. Joseph had had enough. It was time. \" I went to the temple yesterday.\" Joseph kept moving, sliding a hand down his wife's thigh, beginning to lean in for a kiss, a connection, a touch. \" I went to the temple in Rome yesterday.\" Joseph stopped. \" Why?\" \" Well, when I spoke to the Rabbis originally, they...\" She paused. Why was she pausing? What was n't she telling him? \" They said I was n't fit to bear child.\" The words hung in the air, stale and cold. Joseph felt the hardness of his bed underneath him, heard the wild birds cawing outside into the night. \" Those bastards,\" Joseph bellowed. \" Who are they to assume you ca n't bear children! Based on what? On their holy word? What did they even do?\" \" I do n't know!\" \" But... why did n't you say anything? Why would n't you tell me this?\" \" I was afraid! I know how much you-\" \" You were afraid? I wanted a child! I was ready to-\" \" WAIT! I have n't finished yet!\" Joseph stopped and waited. Branches outside his window cracked. The moon slid slowly across the night sky, illuminating his wife through the bitter darkness of their room. \" When I went to Rome, I had... a vision. A Pharisee was there, he had no idea about my prior examination, and he said it was n't to be ignored.\" Joseph sat up in his bed and looked at his wife. There was still information not being shared with him, secrets still left to be uncovered. \" I ask you in the name of our marriage,\" Joseph barely managed to let the words slink out of his throat. His pain was n't allowing him the energy he needed. He felt hollow inside. \" What are you talking about.\" Joseph looked into his wife's eyes and saw an immense amount of fear in them. He realized she had no idea what was going on either, that she was just as scared, just as let down by the idea of not having children on their own. Joseph would have nobody to carry on carpentry with him, nobody to teach prayers to, no young body to yell at to go to bed each night. Joseph fell into his wife and they embraced. Time stood still, and he wept into the shoulders of his wife with mighty heaves and booming roars. Tonight they lost a child they never had, and were n't even allowed a funeral. \" In the vision, God told me he would bear me a child anyways.\" Joseph sat up, and looked at his wife. He was n't sure what that meant. \" God told me I would bear his child, and that I was n't to worry.\" \" Mary, I love you, but-\" \" Joseph, I love you too. Give it time with me. I promise you, God was with me, and promised me a young healthy boy. You'll have someone to join the carpentry business yet.\" Joseph contemplated the gravity of his wife's words. He knew she wanted a child too. It's why they moved to Galilee. Fine. He would trust in her this once. He will listen to his God, and trust in him to deliver what is promised. Joseph laid down, and shut his eyes. The birds cawed in mourning, the branches creaked their sorrows, and Mary slept well that night, the seed of a baby boy already firmly in her womb.

The heat had left her fingers, and they stood out pale against the tarnished brass knob that opened the way down to the cellar. She felt cold. *\" It has been three months,\" *, she thought. The heater kicked on with a distant cough, and warm, dusty air began to stir around Lydia's ankles. It dissipated quickly in the drafty kitchen. She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other. She thought about the quilted comforter tossed back on her bed at that very moment. She thought about how it might still retain some of the heat she'd left behind. Her hand fell to her side, but she did n't move away. Three months since she'd last been in the cellar. She was still trying hard to put it behind her. She still had vivid dreams about what had happened in the basement. *\" Just dreams,\" * she thought. She had resigned herself to the fact that she'd likely dream about it for the rest of her life. If she had learned anything, dreams were fine. Healthy even. It was what she did while she was awake, the things she had n't been able to remember, that haunted her. But it had been three months. *\" No reason to go down into the cold basement and frighten myself over nothing. No reason to stay up like this when I have work in the morning. No reason to-\" * Something shifted audibly in the basement - then again. Slow. Painful. There was a bang, followed by a low moan. Then - quiet, shuddering, laughter. The sound wavered off into wet bubbling, and Lydia watched with horror as her hand went numbly to the knob. The tendons pressed up beneath her bloodless flesh as she willed herself to turn away, to let go, to step back. This was n't right. The knob turned and the door swung open. Everything Maria had told her was a lie. Everything they had done, the last three months, the therapy, had been a deception. It was n't over. Trapped behind eyes that would n't shut, Lydia descended the stairs, and the laughter burbled up from the dark. Each step was like easing down into an autumn pond. The door behind her shut, and she was left floating in the void. Every nerve seemed to vibrate as she strained for the warmth of her quilt, the feeling of the mattress beneath her. Just a dream. A vivid dream. She had had this dream countless times, but the cold had never felt this deep, this hungry. A hand, fever warm and clammy, cupped Lydia's face. It burned in contrast to the cold that had swallowed her up. Lydia could smell something like ozone. The whisper was a hot gust, the breath a chemical wind. Maria's voice betrayed her smile as she whispered into Lydia's ear. \" I was wondering when you'd wake up.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Intimidating all other countries and bludgeoning his way through international politics no longer posed him any challenge. Life presented him no fit adversary. Until The Club. Carlos a close friend nominated him. He was unaware until he was summoned to answer a bet; could he move active troops into another country formerly a part of his country without international sanction? He did. The bets increased. The challenge never ending. Kidnap 200 innocent schoolgirls and hold them indefinitely. Force a another nation unwittingly out of the European Union. Each bet more and more extreme. Each bet more and more dangerous; yet more defining. Then the chance came. He'd earned the position to suggest a bet of his own. Which brought him back to the helicopter and the man aboard it. Mr T was outspoken. He was brash and bold. Mr T was extremely smart; and Mr P was willing to bet a billion dollars he could set a bet Mr T could not win. Mr T jumped off the helicopter and strode purposefully towards Mr P. They shook hands. Mr T's handshake was firm and unwavering. Mr P was surprised yet pleased to return it. Mr P suggested they retire to the state room he'd prepared to discuss the bet. Mr T refused. \" I'm here at the beck and call of The Club. If you've got a bet than out with it. I'm not here to be entertained.\" Mr P was n't entirely shocked at his rudeness, and was somewhat relieved to do away with the pleasantries. \" You're entirely right Mr T. As this is a club bet no formalities are necessary. The bet is this. You are considered one of the most powerful, rich and influential men in your country. Yet there is one considered more powerful than even you. You must during the next presidential election cycle divide your population and separate them into irreconcilable factions.

You must own everything you say, do, and think. Publicly. Do you accept the bet?\" Mr P watched Mr T carefully, awaiting his answer eagerly.

You ca n't kick us out, cuz that would cause us discomfort. You're stuck with us until we get tired of this place. Deal with it.\" The other giraffes cheered in agreement. As much as he hated to admit it, Samantha was right. Well, she was wrong about the curse part; Jim had never been cursed, he'd been given the sacred task of protecting this land, and that entailed never harming the beasts that lived here. And then these giraffes soon found a way to take advantage of that oath. Come to think of it, these giraffes were a major nuisance, so maybe that oath was something of a curse after all. But maybe there was a way to get rid of them without breaking his oath. Jim began walking to his bedroom when a small box fell out of his coat. He tried to pick it up and stuff it back in his pocket, but it had fallen right next to the most galling giraffe of the bunch, who had immediately sat on top of it. \" Ooh, what's this?\" sneered Samantha. \" A package from your boyfriend?\" \" It's nothing,\" said Jim. \" Just let me have it back.\" \" If it's nothing, why do you want it back?\" \" Look, it's basically nothing. I'm not lying. It's part of my oath not to lie. Just give it back.\" \" Nah, I'm gon na open it.\" \" No, no, no, that is a very bad idea.\" \" Shut up, Jim.\" And she ripped the box open. And out came a mist that covered the entire floor, but it was low enough that each giraffe's head was above it. Jim noted how silly it was to see a bunch of giraffe heads poking out of the blanket of mist. \" What the hell is this?\" demanded Samantha. \" Well, I told you not to open it,\" said Jim in a tone that was calm, but also kinda bitchy. And so it was that Jim could see where each giraffe was, so he could avoid stepping on them, but each giraffe could not see his/her own feet, which turned out to be a major inconvenience. See, Jim's house had a cobblestone floor; it was rough an uneven. If you were as big as Jim, you'd barely notice the lumps in the floor, but if you happened to be a small giraffe, these lumps were a big deal, and you'd do well to watch where you stepped. Of course, with the mist, the giraffes could n't watch their steps, so they'd regularly stumble about and fall.

They ask for aid from the only known creatures more brutal than their foes in exchange for FTL technology. Humans accept the deal.", "output": "Bringing a primitive species to fight our wars was n't a new idea, in fact, it was the standard procedure for us, the Tchort Empire: We contacted alien races with a known history of violence, and recruited them as cannon fooders, in exchange for any of the plentiful resources the Empire posseses: Sometimes it was fuel, other times whole worlds, and the most primitive ones were happy with technologies outdated eons ago by our scientists. Our sociologists studied beforehand the swapping species in order to offer them what they strived the most for and, most important, did n't make them too powerful, and generally they accepted happily the deal. This strategy was proven useless against the Chemosh, who defeated effortlessly, and one after another, all enemy armies we bribed against them. The Nihasa Confederacy fleets were wiped out even before they were able to reach the Angira sector we promised to them as spoils of war, a Pwcca Expeditionary Force that attempted a global-scale landing at Vaghesh 9 planet, simply disappeared, soon after setting foot on its surface and their automated drop ships are still orbiting the planet, like if the Chemosh did n't even care about them. After defeating the T'an-mo, the C's learnt their price was a gerontological treatment that increased their life span twice, and suspended briefly their war on us to nuke the defenseless T'an-mo planets first, and then hunting down any survivor or fugitive across the sector, until the whole species were effectively extinct. We were running out of possible allies, the best ones were already defeated and the remaining factions in the sector were too scared to even listen our offers. Without ranks to defend them, our planets started to fall one after another and we were too few and unexperienced to muster an effective resistance. Instead of it, we dispatched desperate diplomatic ships with instructions to offer anything to anyone eager to help us: full citizenship, our latest technologies, the whole empire's treasure, whatever they want to fight our enemies. One of the latest unsuccessful ships, the Naamah, reached her destiny only to learn the Chemosh already blockaded it. It's hard to say if it was panic or the feeling that everything was already lost, but the captain decided to flee by performing a blind jump before C's heavy fire destroys the ship. The Naamah jumped out near the edge of the galaxy and far from either Chemosh or Tchort space but in the void, they picked strange radio signals: They were primitive but definitively non-natural: Decoding them and discovering their search was over was the same thing for Naamah's crew but despite the violent acts the transmissions depicted, Laaron 1, the onboard sociologist, was n't conviced at all: _ The broadcast images seem to be staged, we do n't know if they were actual acts of warfare or it's some sort of entertainment _ An species who chooses such entertainment ca n't be peaceful, their offspring would be psychopaths if they were exposed to such material, argued the captain. _ That's a common myth but there is n't conclusive evidence about a link between entertainment and mental formation, many scientist do n't see it, heck, there are people who thinks it's the violent people who produces violent entertainment... _ Stop the conference, Laaron -Milcom 33, ship's navigator argued- I traced the signals and all of them come from the same planet, see? It's a pre-FTL civilization. _ Sure? _ There are n't broadcasts from other nearby planets or any kind of exchange between them. Only same-planet communications. The captain, that now wanted to take credit for a discovery that may save their civilization, and his career after making a blind jump, insisted: _ If they're as fearsome as the transmissions we picked, it may be worth to give them ships to attack the Chemosh _ No way -Milcom protested- we may unleash a greater evil over the galaxy _ Or planet's different clans may secede from the central goverment until secesion reach disintegration levels, with groups too small to survive leaving the planet and weakening the main civilization. What kind of ally would it be? -added Laaron. _ Besides, Milcom continued, we're talking about a single planet, even if we managed to recruit all its inhabitants, what could they do against the power of hundreds of worlds? _ Come on! They're the only civilization we managed to contact, I say we could at least take a peek. Of course the captain was right, and Humans were at least as violent and ruthless as the Chemosh were, but what really made them different from all other sentient species and caused fear and repulsion in all other creatures was a lust for resources that could never be satisfied. Even the C's realized the dangers of excesive growing, and managed to develope a sustainable civilization. That was, in fact, the key to space travel. As each planet reached its limit, its sons were forced to look for food and fuel outside, but humans were already in the verge of a disaster when the Naamah visited Earth, squishing their homeworld to sustain a 12 billion population, more than all Tchort worlds together and as half as Chemosh population. At first, the T's wanted to provide their own ships but there were n't enough vessels to movilize all human armies or factories to build them. Humans, on the other hand, had the industrial capacity and were only more lustful for tech than for resources. Soon, all sizable rocks in the Sol System had at least a mining station and each city, even the ones in space, had a recruitment center. When humans and chemosh finally meet, the first clashes were unresolved, with big loses at each side, but once humans reached other stars, they started mining them and soon, humanity outproduced the Chemosh. The war was finally over, but as Laaron predicted, the FTL disbanded humanity that spread across the galaxy, always looking for stars to consume.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I cracked my lips apart to begin to let out an inaudible'hi'when \" WHHHHHHOOOOOOOOSSSSSHHHHH!\" \" OH MY GOOOOOODDDDDD!\" I stiffened like a thousand volts of electricity had just gone through my body. I was sweating. My mouth was dry. And still these goddamn shirt stays were bothering me. All I saw was red and black. You'll never know how sweet oxygen tasted until you find yourself in its absence. I took a breath only to feel the wave of heat burn through my throat and into my lungs. It was n't a fraction of a second before I expelled my lungs through my esophagus and tried again. \" FUUUUUUCKKKKKKK!\" I turned away from the source of heat that had suddenly appeared and notice the carpet had turned to asphalt. I know blood when I see it. This was it. My senses kicked in and I went into fight mode. I'd done this before. I turned around and saw the car on fire. I backed away two steps to breath fresh air and turned my face into the direction of the car and drew in the biggest breath I could and charged in. \" HEEEEELLLPPP! PLEASE!!\" I had n't taken two steps before the heat became unbearable. I pulled my Leatherman from my belt and reach into the window. You always start with the seatbelt. That's the first thing. I'd seen it before. Burn victims were always the hardest to handle. Desperation sets in and that's when you lose the fight. The door would give. I reach into the window enough to feel the broken glass dig into my stomach. Fuck the heat! The smoke. The smell of burning cotton, flesh, nylon. I could n't think. His hands reach over my shoulders and I grabbed him by his trousers and pulled my way out of the window. We fell to the asphalt and into a couple of sets of arms. I was on my back and I only saw sky. The sounds of chaos were welcomed. Like an old friend you forgot you knew suddenly showing up at your doorstep. Picking up again where you left off. A woman in a sky blue sundress was over me. \" Holy shit that was fast. Any chance my deductible will hold?\" The sky turned to ceiling tiles. The pretty nurse was giving me mouth to mouth. I guess you can say that was our first kiss. Iam was standing over me with his arms crossed. \" Did you get a policy number?\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I will be adrift in the darkness - no touch and no sound to sustain me - waiting for my mind to shake itself free.

Michael had grown used to strange conversations in the last two years they'd been living together, but he usually humoured his friend because many of them led in interesting directions and he'd usually at least learn something from the other man. Unfortunately, the admission of this tended to massage Craig's already sizeable ego. As Michael took a sip from his beer, he resigned himself to taking the bait, \" I've noticed a slight snag in the plan, mate: you're a fucking atheist.\" \" Well, an agnostic atheist as opposed to a gnostic one. I mean, the Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted to doubts over his faith, so it's only really a short hop from an agnostic theist to an agnostic atheist.\" Michael sighed. He could challenge Craig on this point, but did n't fancy a lecture about the number of atheists in the clergy, so he let it slide. He felt that Craig's ability to remember titbits from an article he read last year in *Obscure Facts Weekly* or wherever the fuck he got his information conferred an unfair advantage in random debates, so he had given up arguing in favour of being lectured long ago. \" Okay, fine. But you've clearly been unemployed far too long if that's started seeming like a viable career path. Plus,\" Michael nodded at the joint taking form in Craig's hands, \" I do n't think you'd quite fit in as a holy man.\" \" Well, it depends on the denomination I guess. I know many traditions frown on such vices, but some prefer to cut the bullshit and the rules are basically boil down to,'Be excellent to each other.'And that's what I'm all about.\" Shit. He always did this. Make an outlandish statement, and then find a convoluted way to make it seem reasonable. His friend would probably call it solipsism, but he always had been a pretentious twat. He claimed he simply used the most appropriate word from his, admittedly extensive, vocabulary for the situation. Michael was n't sure he fully bought that one yet. Michael opted for a sceptical murmur rather than bothering to form a rebuttal. \" I *know* I would n't be very good at the fire and brimstone stuff, so that kind of rules out Baptist churches, and the taboos around sex really put a damper on being a Catholic priest. But your friendly neighbourhood Church of England vicar would really suit me. Being there when people need support, helping the community and of course lecturing from my pulpit are things I could really get into.\" Michael had no doubts about the last point. Although giving Craig a speaking platform would probably result in sermons which lasted longer than even Michael could bear. \" Okay, whatever.

The entryway I stood in was large enough to fit someone three stories tall, but I had been surprised when it opened with ease. The hall was deceptively plain at first glance, but as my eyes drifted upward I saw complex carvings and figures looking up with arms stretched out, as if holding the crisp blue sky where the ceiling would have been. In hesitation I turned to look down the path from where I came. The weathered stone steps lined the hillside, and I could see the beach where I had woken up. Behind the small cove, hills rolled off towards the horizon, with patches of meadow here and there. I bit my lower lip, and scanned for any signs of life. It occurred to me that on top of not knowing where I was or how I got there, I had trouble remembering *when* it was. I could remember what I thought was the day before; I had been with my children and grandchildren in the hospital. The feeling of their hugs and the tubes around me felt vivid and real, as if they had just been there. But, despite how real it felt, I wondered if it had been a dream; as I stood looking over the beach, I could see that I was young. A breeze slid by, and I turned abruptly as a large thunk rang behind me. The wind had caught the door, and it bellowed against the marble frame inside. I sighed, and calmed myself. *What is this place? * With caution I stepped through the entrance into the hall. I could hear the trees rustling outside, their whooshing calls sweeping like a downpour. Minutes passed, and as I neared the end of the hall, I saw that it came to an intersection, diverging left and right. Two great oak trees stood. I drew close, and my brows furrowed. There, under the brilliant sky and framed by the mighty trees was a simple, white throne. I scoffed, feeling weight in my gut and holding the knuckle of my index finger to my lip. *It can't be…* I looked about, checking for any obvious dangers; even if this place were abandoned, it could still have things to avoid. Seeing none, I moved to look closer at the chair. I felt uneasy; I wasn't sure how I'd react if this place were in fact heaven. The only thing I knew for sure was that despite the answer I was trying to find, there wasn't a soul in sight. I reached the base of the throne, and looked it over meticulously. There were no markings, not even a single scratch on the radiant seat. I looked to the wall behind, and saw dim yet bold script embedded in the marble. As I read, my breath caught in my throat. My eyes widened, and the hairs on my arms raised against the warmth of the sun.

He had no idea how he had got himself into this situation yet again. No matter how careful his plans and their execution, he somehow always ended up running away from someone, or something. This had earned him the nickname Jinx among the other guild members. He had been desperately trying to turn his luck around and get rid of that stupid name but it never worked and somehow his colleagues always found out about his newest failed endeavour. But not today! He had learned from every failure. He had learned to counter-act his bad luck and he had never been as prepared as tonight. So what if he had to put more work into a heist than the others? He gladly did it and he did n't let himself dwell on his past busts. Tonight he was going to show them all that being lucky could n't hold a candle to being prepared. But so far, nothing had worked. He had used almost every trick in his book, but every single one had failed. It was time for his secret weapon. Well, his 16th secret weapon. He took a little flask from the satchel at his hip and threw it on the ground in front of him. The shop keeper had told him it was a smoke bomb, and it had been labelled as such as well. But someone in the line of production had screwed up, because it did not produce a smoke screen. It did however, succeed in giving him a coughing fit and teary eyes, making it hard for him to see where he was going. But that did n't deter him for long. He was used to this kind of thing happening and over years of accidentally consuming, applying or just touching all sorts of irritating and poisonous substances, he had built up a natural immunity. His coughing fit was over shortly and his sight cleared up. And he still had n't been wounded by a single arrow. Of course, that was n't down to his luck, for he knew he had none. Most arrows hit their mark but the iron plating he had sewn into his cloak years ago made him nearly invulnerable from the back, if a bit slower. It was time for his next secret weapon. He took out and put on a little golden ring which would give him the power of invisibility for about five minutes each day. He had tried it out often enough to know how it worked and how he knew it worked. It did n't, this time. In fact, not only did it not do what it was supposed to, it seemed to completely short out, giving him quite a painful shock. But again, nothing he could n't handle. It was n't the last ace up his sleeve. Satisfied that they now ran through narrow and winding hallways and firing arrows would be difficult, he dropped his cape and felt immediately how much faster he was now. He rounded the next corner, -his pursuers still hot on his tail - and ran straight into a guard who, according to his carefully prepared notes and plans, had no business being there. The guard, however, was just as surprised as he was and so they both fell to the ground in a tangled mess of limbs. Before the guard could get up, he hit her over the head with his satchel, which ripped at the seam and spilled all of his useful gadgets and looted treasures. Grabbing what he could, he bolted before his pursuers had had enough time to catch up with him. So things had n't quite gone according to plan, yet again. No use crying over spilt milk. He still had some of his loot and all of his dignity. And, most importantly, an escape plan. He kicked in the door to the room where he had previously hid the rope and hook, only to find it empty. The barrel he had stashed it in was n't there anymore. Neither were any of the others. Someone must have moved them during the day, just his luck. Knowing that might happen, he had taken a rope with him and then left it behind when his satchel tore. Time to improvise then! He assembled a makeshift rope out of his belt and breeches in next to no time. Despite, or maybe because of the misfortune that followed him, he was quite nimble. He figured that if you kept getting yourself into sticky situations you had to be able to think and act on your feet. Using the only valuable item he still had - a little gold statuette - as a hook, he started his descent. He was about half-way down when he heard a loud ripping sound. Before he could even start to worry, he was already on his way down, and way faster than before. He managed to land, despite his bad luck, in a pile of hay. A pile of hay in which some farmer had unfortunately misplaced his pitchfork. Rubbing his behind he decided it was time to cut his losses and head homewards. He'd just have to go around as Jinx a bit longer.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "Civil War", "output": "Child, I will tell you a tale. It is one that my father's father told him. It is about a place far to the north, where a great river runs. Once, there was a great city on its banks. Tho'eta, the city of a thousand flags. It was a marvel of craftsmanship. For five-hundred and seventy-five years it was the capital of Korda'an. It had, in its long history, kings and queens and emperors rule from atop the great hill that for reasons long forgotten was called \" The Crown of Thorns\". The valley it inhabited was fertile and rather beautiful. Rocky edifices framed the long and winding route that the Koreth River took on its way to the sea. From those lofty heights, hundreds of tiny waterfalls fell like strands of silver hair. In the fall, the great trees that lined the valley floor turned a deep shade of red, and the great feasts that took place before the first winds of winter celebrated many things, life and death and the promise of rebirth. The great bonfires of the autumn festivals could be seen for miles. Shepherds on the high steppes to the north often claimed that they could see a dull reddish glow on the horizon. A few, who might have had too great an imagination, even claimed that they could smell the honeyed nuts for which the capital was revered wafting on the cool northern breezes. The people of Tho'eta were happy. Their city was vibrant and full of sights and sounds. There were thinkers and mathematicians. There were smiths and artists. There were street performers who would wear costumes and dance and breath fire like the dragons of old. In the evenings, even in the mild winters, the old women would gather on the great bridge spanning the Koreth river in the city's heart. There, they would sell trinkets and homespun goods. The musicians, ever-seeking the crowds, would follow. It was natural for the strumming of harps and the call of flutes to sound long into the twilight hours. The men worked hard for their families and cared little for the happenings abroad. The world beyond their valley was a place for the merchants, adventurers, and the Imperial Legion to tread. The average man felt no restlessness. What more can a man want from the world? Truly, the city of Tho'eta was a marvel to behold. Now, for some reason, perhaps the wrath of the Gods or some foul magic from the old world, there came a deep and abiding drought in the north. Shepherds and flocks died together, alone on the vast steppe. The crops withered and perished. Trees dried until their corpses could provide little more than firewood. Towns vanished, the structures abandoned to the elements. The great kingdom withered from within. The great city and its fertile valley was spared most of the punishment. Perhaps they were a more pious lot. Perhaps, as some said, the \" Crown of Thorns\" was truly the top of Thowsareta's head and he protected his name-city from harm. Whatever the reason, the city's festivities were still happy and vibrant. When those northern people saw the bonfire lights on the southern horizon, they thought darker thoughts than the revelers. A man can not abide without food. Given time both his mind and his body wither. He loses his grasp of what is good and what is ill. He cares only for salvation, for sustenance. Any man who promises a way to fill that care can become a king among the starving. And so it was that a king rose. This king did not rule from the Crown. This king ruled from a withering horse. He lead men, and women, and even children. He took them south, where he promised them salvation. He told them tales of the great wealth and the infinite bounty that the south lands and the great city could provide. So by the hundreds, and then by the thousands, they trekked southward. Their stomachs hurt and their thoughts were scattered. If one were to look too closely at that great horde, one might notice that in the night some would go missing. For a few days thereafter, those around them would be contented. Then the hunger would return again and new prey would have to be found. When a man must resort to such measures, does he remain a man? Well, in the fourth year of the drought, the horde arrived in Tho'eta. Those simple northerners, half crazed with hunger, could scarcely believe their eyes. It was like nothing they had ever beheld. In that moment, whatever bound them to their countrymen vanished. There were no more rules. There was no more order. They even abandoned their own king. He had taken them to salvation, now they were going to take it. It was said, by the shepherds on the rolling southern hills, that for three weeks the northern sky bled a deep red. It was the greatest bonfire that any of them had ever seen or would ever see again. In the port city of Duna-by-the-Sea, they said the river ran red for a month. Who knows with the old stories, though. Perhaps men are capable of such atrocities. Perhaps those that commit those atrocities are no longer men.

The only notable external differences from a normal school bus of the same make and model are the lack of a side mounted stop sign and the presence of what appear at first glance to be reflective one-way glass windows. The usual faux-gold Ersatz Industries logo on the front of the bus is also changed, being replaced with a silver logo reading { redacted }. The biggest differences are present on the interior of the bus. The one-way windows are covered in a silver resin, producing the one-way glass look. The seats are missing, replaced by a series of twelve ( 1 2 ) organic pods that display the same silvery coloring of the windows. A series of silver cables or vines connect to the pods, with one cable per pod. The cables lead to the front of the passenger area of the bus, where they disappear into a hole in the dashboard. Upon opening the hood of the vehicle, it was discovered that the cables connect to a mass of silvery flesh covering the engine. The mass contains large amounts of scar tissue where the heated and moving parts of the engine make contact with the mass. An additional set of cables connect to major control systems of the vehicle, while others remain coiled around the mass. In all, the cables number thirty-six ( 3 6 ). Tissue samples reveal a composition similar to a █████ ███████. Four ( 4 ) pods were removed from the bus with a standard SQ blowtorch used to cauterize the end of the cables as each pod was removed. Two of the pods were from the front row of pods, while the other two were from the last row. When the further back pods were opened, they were found to be half-full with a mixture resembling a mixture of diesel fuel and organic matter consistent with the amounts found in the body of one ( 1 ) twelve-year-old human child. The forward pods were completely full. When they were opened half of the liquid contents spilled onto the ground and were lost. The remaining fluid was found to be large amounts of { redacted } with trace amounts of human organic matter. The solid contents were identified as the remains of Alice and Terrence ███████, the children of Mrs. ███████, who first reported the anomaly.

Usual stuff when a guy retires. \" Hey old man\" this and \" Oi silver fox\" that. My locker was filled with shaving cream, as though being the city's oldest waste management technician meant I had n't cleaned up enough shit in my lifetime already. The first stop was the worst. Still dark. My'buddies'had disconnected the hydraulics on my truck, so everything had to be loaded by hand - the old fashioned way. I was half expecting it and half hoping they would n't. My back is n't what it used to be. I grabbed the first can and my fingers froze. The word arthritis crept into my brain but I pushed it away, trusted my back and hoisted the can up over the back of the truck. It emptied easily, and I swung it back down to the kerb just like I did 20 years ago. Surprising that all my muscles still remembered how. The rest of the run was uneventful, none of my joints were sore and I was almost enjoying the exercise. I was pleased with the hard work, and was only sweating lightly. I felt younger and lighter somehow. Like I used to feel, when she... well that's all in the past now. Moving on is the best thing you can do, is n't it? Maybe my knees were strong enough to keep her garden alive in my retirement. It would be nice if something of her survived, I suppose. I turned the last corner onto the main street and stopped at a lone garbage can. It was strange. I had never had to stop here before. It did n't occur to me until that moment why - and it was that this house had never put it's garbage cans out before. No idea what they normally did their trash. Maybe they were hoarders or paid for a private service. Maybe the house was abandoned. Who knows? But the can was out today, so I stopped and jumped down to the kerb... ok ya got me, I climbed down carefully and tried not to put too much weight on one leg at a time. At my age you can't be too careful. I stopped at the can to look the house over. It looked like old money. Really out of place for this neighbourhood. All curtains drawn and the gates were closed. Quite remarkable architecture now that I considered it: ivy grew on lattice over beige stucco walls, door frames set into high arches, large bay windows drawing your eyes up to dark purple metal roofing with... parapets? Spires? Weird. Like a mixture between a cottage and a castle. Suddenly the house seemed remarkable, and I could not explain why I had not noticed it before. While trying to figure it out, a small squeak came from the can beside me. I jumped. I'm not usually skittish, but I was so absorbed in the look of this odd residence that I forgot about the garbage. Settling myself, I tapped the can with my foot and heard a curious mixture of rustling and thudding. Now, I had dealt with my fair share of raccoons during my career, so I grabbed The Negotiator from the toolbox on the truck. The Negotiator is a special tool you'll find on most city waste trucks. It's a length of pipe about a foot and a half long. Steel. Not too thick, like water pipe, but large enough to be a good lever if you have to get a valve open, heavy enough to knock loose stuck garbage from inside a can, and intimidating enough to deter animals and road ragers. Extremely useful tool. The Negotiator and I went back to the can, and after a few practice swings, I carefully lifted the lid and heard a number of new squeaks. Puppies? Seven in all. Seven beautiful, heart-melting labrador puppies. I was relieved and delighted all at the same time. They were climbing all over each other in the limited space afforded by a standard city garbage can, and as soon as they saw me seven little tales started wagging and seven little tongues poked out excitedly. People have dumped animals before, but never a whole litter of seemingly quite healthy and properly bred dogs. Labrador pups go for over $ 300 around here, easily. How crazy to find them like this. I thought of approaching the house to enquire. Maybe the same dotty old rich lady who ca n't weed the lawns around her castle anymore accidentally threw the puppies out, and I took a step towards the gate but stopped immediately. My move towards the house brought a cold dread about me. It felt like there was a weight in my guts, and I somehow knew that it would be very very wrong to approach the house.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

After the nine to five grind, we would all head to the National to talk about the hookers we fucked the night before. The conversations were analytical and critical; we were like Foodies, but with bought pussy. Sager discussed the pros and cons of ill-fitting bras with Reynolds as I asked Henderson for a lead. I have been striking out lately. I mean, yea, I always fucked somebody, but I wasn't getting bang for the buck. The girls I have been with recently have left me passionless. All fuck and suck, but no charisma. I've even tried multiple girls on the same night, unsatisfied with the first one or two, thinking the *next* one has got to have what I've been missing. No dice. I started to think perhaps the problem is myself. Maybe I'm growing up. I asked Henderson for recommendations before casting anymore doubt on my lifestyle choices. I told him how desperate I was, and I really needed a piece of ass that would get the wheels rolling again. Either my depravity or my desperation moved him, because he looked over his shoulder to make sure Sager and Reynolds continued arguing proper tit contortion, and he reached for his wallet.

She handles the rest, \" he said with a authoritarian stare reassuring her legitimacy. I stepped outside as soon as possible and dialed her number. I got a polite hello, and I asked for Sara Nelson. She laughed, then asked where I lived. I provided her with my address without hesitation. She told me to be ready for her in two hours. I left the National immediately to prepare myself. Sara arrived fifteen minutes early. She even dressed like she was ready for a business meeting. She had a brief case with her. She inspected the apartment from the doorway. After inviting her in, she stepped through the threshold, turned around to close the door, and turned back and slapped me so hard my cheek cut against teeth. \" Now get on your knees, filth! \" As soon as I did, she pressed her pelvis into my face. She lifted her dress over my head. She was not wearing panties. I would say this was nice, but she was suffocating me with her pussy, pushing on the back of my head. Every time I turned my head to breathe like an athlete swimmer practicing relay, she would yank my hair painfully and yell at me for stopping. I had to slap on her thighs, punch them really, to have her release me. When she did, she pushed my forehead and toppled me over to the wood floor. \" I only tell my first timers once, if you want to end your suffering, read the safeword off the back of my calling card. \" She then proceeded to punish me. She sat on my chest, back facing me, and yanked my pants down and started to squeeze my dick like a hapless mouse she kept in her pocket as a pet. She punched my thighs, Indian burned my cock, pulled on it like Stretch Armstrong. I implored for her to stop but she continued. I tried to remember what the back of this card said. I do n't think I ever read it. I imagined safewords. Tugboat. Marzipan. Knock it off! What did it say on the back!? \" Do you want to get fucked? \" she yelled at me while tugging on the skin of my nut sack to be drawn and quartered. I answered yes. She reached quickly into her briefcase, sitting on me still, and produced a large pink dildo. \" I'm going to stick this fucking thing in you, \" she told me. I pushed her off of me and ran into the bedroom where my wallet was. I'm not exaggerating; she fucking chased me in there like she was Jack Nicholson and I was Shelley Duvall. She caught me by the forearm and swung me so that I slammed into a wall. I found the wallet on my bedside table and I grabbed for it. She pulled on my boxers and when I felt the rubber divide my ass cheeks I was able to rip the card out. I read it over: Sara Nelson: Motivational Speaker- Career Counselor. I flipped it over. \" It was all a dream!! *IT WAS ALL A DREAM!! * \" I screamed and then like magic the attack ended. I turned and Sara was smirking at me, slapping the pink monstrosity against her hand like a brandished weapon. \" I'll only charge you for the half session, \" she said and waited for me to pay her, menacing me still with her bludgeon. After she left and I locked the door, I called Henderson and told him that he was dead to me. I could hear him, Reynolds and Sager laughing in the background. After his giggle, he said, \" When I was little, I used to complain to my dad to turn up the heat. He would make me stand outside ten minutes in the snow before he let me back in. I would plead for him to let me back inside, and when he did it felt so good. \" \" Your point being? \" \" My point being: you can come back inside now. \" My listlessness was cured. I was happy with the mediocre sluts, and especially enjoyed the rare occasions where I picked a real winner. Sure, I wanted to strangle Henderson when he sicked that malignant creature Sara Nelson on me, but what he offered that day was a new perspective. He asked for the card back but I told him I lost it. I keep it in my wallet still, and pull it out every so often, stared at her phone number, and then the card wasn't a card like a djinn's lamp isn't a lamp.

You can figure this all out while you are eating. A tall blonde waitress aproached Stans table, a plate with food in one hand, a tall glass of beer in the other. She had a slight grin on her face. \" Bitte sehr, ein mal Käsespätzle.\" she said. \" Danke.\" he heard himself say. He looked at the plate, yes this were Käsespätzle. He did n't know why or how he knew that, he just did. Admitedly the word had a strange tone but it was right at the same time. Ok I guess I'm in germany now... or it is around me. He started to eat. It was almost three years now since the world started shifting around him. At first it were small things, a room was where it should n't be. New buildings standing where there were none before and old ones disappeared, only to show up on the other end of town a few days later. Perhaps they did n't so much disappear, as relocate but Stan could n't check that. He only had so much time to wander around the city each day, searching for places he once knew. He had tried to talk to other people about it, but nobody else seemed to notice the things he saw. The things that changed. They probably thought he was excentric, maybe even crazy but that did n't matter. The particular nature of his reality had it's advantages as well as disadventages, once people had shifted far away enough from him, they seemed to forget him, like they never knew each other. Stan had n't yet decided if this was good or bad. His family was gone, that was bad. Although that also meant his mother in law, which could be considered good. He stopped eating for a second as he examined this thought. Well no, that was n't good... it was fucking fantastic! Even after the divorce that demon had n't stopped ruining his life. Yes perhaps this was n't so bad after all. Besides, somehow there always seemed to be people that knew him. Like the waitress, she called him by his first name when he entered the restaurant, she also smiled a lot. What a shame, in a week or so she would be somewhere else, oblivious to his existance. The restaurant was already way out of reach, one or two days and he would n't be able to find it again. What a shame, he should have asked her out. In this world intimicy was hard to achieve, he barly became to know a person before he was unable to track them down. There were a few days where he would wake up in a bigger bed, another person besides him. Imagine the shock of waking up in the morning, with a stranger in your bed, telling you to calm down. Humans are remarkable creatures, Stan thought. You can get accustomed to about anything. The first time this had happened he had to spend the night in a rather umcomfortable cell, bound to the bed, the warm touch of sedatives in his venes. But he adjusted, waking up besides a stranger became routine. He was only startled again when he first woke up near another man. He was n't gay, not the part of him that thought. However the part of him that shifted, the part that spoke german, the part of him that knew what too do when he was at his various workplaces, eventhough he had never been there before, the part that knew what Käsespätzle were, could appearently be gay. And he adjusted. He finished his Spätzle and sighed. Well better get back to work. He went to work the next day. On his break he went out to look for the restaurant, but as he expected it was nowhere to be found. For some reason it hit him a little harder than usual, but he just shrugged it off and went on to find another place to eat. Get over it Stan, you knew this would happen. At the moment Stan worked as a Game Developer. Amazed he watched himself, as his Hands were speeding across his Wacom tablet, apparently he was quite the artist. He adjusted the breast size of a character he was working on and thought \" Take that for giving me an F in art class Mrs. Quinn. Now I get paid for drawing big boobies.\". He chuckled a little bit to himself. A day later he went out for a break. He was furious, some idiot from the art departement messed up the rigs and somehow deleted the backups, all the animations he carefully crafted over the last weeks were useless now. And the worst part was that he himself was that idiot, when he worked in that departement yesterday. Sometimes this existance was still strange to him. Also, the she-beast he awoke next to this morning was n't at all his type. Also she only seemed to be able to communicate by screaming vulgarities, mixed with the occasional sentence. He did n't even bother to learn her name. He was n't sure what to eat, all these shifting cultures sometimes messed with his stomach. He needed something familiar today, something that would be almost disgustingly the same no matter where he was and what language he spoke. That could only mean one thing. He sighed and looked for the next MCDonalds. It did n't take long to find one. Inside, he went to the counter and ordered while he looked at the menu. Why did he even do that, he knew what he was going to order before he even walked into the building. \" One Bigmac and large fries please.\" \" Are you sure?\" a strangely familiar voice said. Stan looked up. \" How about some Käsespätzle instead.\" She grinned. He looked at her and laughed. He could make this work. They just had to adjust. _____________________ [ WP ] You go to work one day and notice your cubicle is in a completely different location.

I have never seen the Earth, but my parents did. My generation is supposedly the only hope for humanity with the 10+ billion people on Earth. I always longed to see the Earth, or even the beautiful sun we orbited. **JANUARY 14, 2056 @ 14:00** On my 9th Birthday, I asked my parents if I could finally leave the domes, they told me it was too dangerous. I asked if I could see the Earth outside the dome with them. They told me it was beautiful but that did not matter as I would be very important to the growth of humanity. No one would ever tell me why I could n't leave the dome or see Earth with my telescope outside. This would make me very outraged. **JANUARY 14, 2065 @ 23:00** I was finally 18 years old. I was now a legal adult according to the laws of the Proxima B colony. I walked up to my mother and father, asking them once again if I could leave the dome just like I asked every year since I was nine. This time they did n't say no. They said in a sarcastic matter, \" Well, if you want to see the sky, why do n't you just get people to support your cause?\". I got outraged and walked away. That was the last time I ever saw them. **JANUARY 31, 2069 @ 13:56** I embarked on my journey outside of my dome. I had to collect resources over the course of 4 years. I had to make numerous connections and build up support for my cause. I entered the tunnel leading to the entrance vault with a GoPro attached to my helmet. I opened the hatch and closed it really quick to prevent radiation from seeping in. I rode my shiny grey Rover out into the great beyond that is the rest of my home planet. I could see all the stars of the Milky Way. I used my telescope and I could see Earth. It was so beautiful. I then decided to make a decision that would change my life forever. I removed my helmet and space suit and I immediately went unconscious. **FEBRUARY 2, 2069 @ 16:35** I woke up in an unfamiliar place. I opened my eyes and I could not see through one eye. I looked down in a rushed and terrified manner and noticed that are or my limbs were missing. The doctor was apparently standing next to me and started talking. He explained, \" I am so sorry that this happened to you. When you went unconscious, you were exposed to radiation throughout your body. You developed so many tumors that your legs, arms, and your left eye.\" **JANUARY 17, 2070 @ 19:00** I finally finished going through rehab with my prosthetic limbs. I even got a bionic eye. Most people question the decisions I made and the thoughts I had but, it was worth it. It was worth it because in the end, even though I lost all of my limbs and my eye, I still got to see Proxima Centauri and, even better, the Earth. **EDIT: ** First prompt.

Your job is to come up with the best ideas to piss off the deceased in order to maximise energy production.", "output": "Helllooooo, internet. It's me. The most important asshole you've never heard of. If you live... I guess anywhere in the civilized world, you will be experiencing some major power outages within the next week. I'm here to tell you why that should be the least of your worries. Do n't worry, though. You've got a few days to read this and prepare.. I'd start by stockpiling some fucking flamethrowers if I were you. But we'll revisit that. Point is, the pooch has been screwed. The pale horse is leaving her stable as we speak. And if you do n't want to be among the first to go, you should probably take this very seriously. I work for HIVE. Since we've done a pretty damn good job concealing what that is from you regular people, that's an acronym I should probably explain. It's the Human Institute for Vampiric Energy. What's vampiric energy, you ask? It's power siphoned from literally making the dead spin in their graves, and it's secretly been powering modern civilization for the last 50 years. That's right. Every solar panel, windmill, and hydroelectric dam you've ever seen has been smoke and mirrors; giant props with no real function other than to stop regular Joes from asking questions about just how in the blue hell we can possibly supply power 24/7 to millions of people. I mean, think about the logistics of that for a second. You expect anybody to believe a bunch of giant pinwheels in a field, a few mirrors pointing up at the sun in the middle of the desert, and a fucking dam of all things, are even capable in theory of generating a fraction of that kind of energy? If you had n't been conditioned from birth to think this was even feasible, you'd never buy it. Give me a fucking break; the way we're allegedly powering all our shit is objectively absurd. Anyway, here's where I come in. We make people spin in their graves exactly how you've always known we do -- by offending the ever-loving hell out of them. We call it the HIVE Mind, and to spare you a bunch of sciency BS I'm only casually familiar with myself, I'll put it like this: The HIVE Mind translates speech to thought, and broadcasts that thought directly to the dead. And me? I'm that annoying little voice in their heads telling them why Hitler had the right idea all along. That's actually how they found me. I was at some dive hipster coffee bar making off-color Nazi puns on open mic night. A high-ranking government official just so happened to be in the audience. I guess I fit the profile, and hell, why not? No close family, a select few friends... and nothing offends the sensibilities like an entitled, sarcastic white guy cracking Third Reich jokes. After the show, he offered me a figure with more zeros than I've ever seen to fake my death, come live in a bunker in the middle of nowhere, and piss off dead people for a living. Since I like money and the act of having tons of it, I said yes, \" died\" in a horrific accident on my way home, and have been here ever since. That's about all I really need to divulge. This is my warning to all of humanity, not my autobiography. Here's what you need to know: 1 ) The grid is down. It went offline three months ago, and attempts to restore it have been unsuccessful. It is now too late. The energy we've been storing for decades is all but gone after one hot summer, and when the last of it runs out, that's all there's ever going to be. 2 ) When the power goes, with it go our precautions. This part's really going to suck for all you poor fucks up on the surface, because... well, let me put it this way. You ca n't offend something that lacks a consciousness. What you should take away from my story is not, and repeat, NOT, that we were speaking to the dead. It's that they were fucking listening. 3 ) If a being is smart enough to understand when somebody's calling its mother a whore, you can be pretty damn sure said being can understand the concept of boarded-up windows when nobody's answering the door. Do me a favor, and do n't prepare for this like it's some kind of zombie invasion. I'm trying to prolong your life here, not herd you into proverbial sardine cans. You've got a limited window to think of something here. When high-ranking officials the world over vanish on Friday morning, it's going to be pandemonium. And when the power goes out on Saturday night, it's going to get a hell of a lot worse. I do n't know what to tell you. It's way too late to fix what we've broken, and all you can do now is brace for impact. So, why post this here? Hah. Why not? What difference does anything make anymore? The security locks on my now-irrelevant bunker have already been tripped, and when the power fails, that's it for me. I'll never see the light of day again. Besides, I'm partly responsible for this, so I feel like I owe you a little time to prepare. Prepare. That's what you should be doing. That's really the only thing you can do. Because in a few days, when armies of ghouls rain down on society to silence us for decades of verbal abuse, the best gift I can give you is to know they're coming ahead of time.

When you took up reading and the school bully made fun of you for it Jordan was the first person to run between you two and fight the bully. Jordan is one of the best people you know. Which makes it all the more heartbreaking when you visit him. Every time they walk him out to visit you he offers the same smile as always. But the meds always make him noticeably tired.

You risk a look over your shoulder and still see nothing. You reach over and grasp one of his hands gently. \" Jordan it's okay. I'm here. Nothing will happen.\" Truth be told you were a little frightened. Jordan never lashed out during his episodes but it was always a possibility. Like the day they brought him here.

Bookworm you have to promise me. Do n't look in their eyes.\" Your tongue suddenly feels dry and you mutter out a half-hearted promise. Jordan's gaze does n't relent. \" Bookworm. Please. You have to leave. Do n't come back. Pretend I'm dead like Mom and Dad do. Do whatever you have too but do n't come back. I love you.\" You get up as the doctor starts walking towards you. You're more than a little disturbed by the meeting but realize that more than ever Jordan needs you to be a stable force in his life. Maybe you should visit more often.

Once he had tried to keep track of the time in his head but it was too much of a distraction. That lack of concentration had almost cost him his life. With his eyes locked on the clock, he began to drink in as much of the situation as he could manage from his peripheral vision. It was dark in his small room, but the moon shined through the small window to the left of his bed, giving a soft glow to his surroundings. He saw the desk by his window, undisturbed from the way he left it. At the foot of the bed his chest of clothes was closed and locked, also how he left it. Nothing he was seeing explained the sound, the sharp clicking sound that made him bolt straight up from his pillow and look straight ahead at his clock. Like the many times before, as long as he was looking at the clock, he would be ok. Frustrated by the lack of an obvious explanation, he did the only thing left to do. He slowly turned his head to the left, eyes deadlocked on the clock still. As the night stand next to his bed slid into view, he saw nothing out of the ordinary. His phone was still plugged in, the charging light a bright green in the edge of his vision.

Ever so slowly, he began to turn his neck to his right, towards the door to the hallway outside of his room. His body froze and his eyes almost darted away from the clock for the briefest moment. In the corner of his vision, he could make out a slim metallic shape. Most likely the lamp, he told himself. He needed to turn a little more to get the rest of it in view. His eyes tracked the clock to the left edge of his vision as he turned to make sense of what he was seeing. A gun, cocked, pointed at his head.

{"input": "Write the first chapter of that book you've been putting off.", "output": "Théâtre du Roi - King's Theater, one of the first cinemas in the city. The whole French flair is a bit unnecessary, since it just has a generic art-deco theme with some arguably Art Noveau flairs to it if you take the term liberally. The lobby was quite simple and the stage was n't too extravagant, but the theater itself is phenomenally dark when it needs to be. In the veil of absolute darkness sits a lovely group of 214 husbands, wives, and a handful of children cackling and laughing at The Little Tramp waltzing around on the screen, making an absolute ass out of himself. Never was a fan, even before I stepped foot in the theater. For some reason, I felt like I'd come around watching this exclusive film shipped in straight from Hollywood to celebrate this theater's opening. But of course, anyone who's bored enough can find something to appease them. For me, it's the shiny, bald head of a man sitting directly in front of me, just three rows ahead. He seems just as unamused and lonely as I am, the poor guy. Both of us sat there as Chaplin got chewed up and spit out by cogs and machinery, his slapstick comedy captivating only 212 members of the audience. Eventually, it did come to a close, and everyone began to disperse into the rain-soaked cobblestone streets bathed in the incandescent glow of streetlamps and storefronts alike. I left as soon as I could to go across the street to grab a cup of coffee from a late night cafe, chalk full of conspiring artists and skirmishing philosophers getting bouts of passion out of their system before they call it a night. And at eleven o'clock sharp, I notice the poor little bald man emerge from the theater, a good twenty minutes after everyone else had left. The bald man walked straight out of the mahogany-clad double doors and took a left, walking under the passing glow of those ancient streetlights with every third or fourth step landing on a shallow puddle of water collected in little imperfections and divots in the sidewalk. He cursed under his breath as he stepped in a particularly large puddle, splashing muddy water against his trench coat. After a quick glance behind him, the shady character hastened his pace towards the Weimarplatz Station, a grand elevated rail station acting as a jewel on one of three strings billowing out along the upper, central, and lower portions of the city proper. The Théâtre du Roi could have definitely taken some advice from this station, because this ultramodern piece of engineering looked almost as if a portion of Paris had been plopped in this little German city, with ornate arches and geometric curves in the wrought iron skin setting it apart from the rest of the buildings surrounding the platz. After a brisk walk through the vacant platz, he climbed up three flights of stairs to the upper floor of this station, waiting on a platform perched above the tiny newsstands and confectioneries that filled the space below. Under the glow of cheaply made Yablochkov candle knock-offs, the bald man sat waiting for seventeen minutes, his well-polished head glimmering in the cream-colored light for the entire duration. As he waited, he adjusted a small tote bag which had been concealed by his long coat, disguising these adjustments as impatient stirrings in his seat. However, if you looked closely enough, you could notice the corners of the bag ever so slightly outlining itself in the side of his coat as it sat perched in the pit of his arm. The little yellow train finally arrived after a slight delay, which was somewhat acceptable in the off-hours as newer drivers were being trained and acclimated to the relatively simple Einsamburg Stadtbahn network. After a lurching halt, the doors opened to the left as a few late night commuters stepped onto the platform and walked down to the dark platz below. The bald man stepped onto the train, sitting in a barren car until the train came to a halt just before it's last stop. He emerged from the car, walked down the stairs of a similarly elevated station onto the street below, and followed the boulevard for three more blocks until he reached his townhouse. 226 Tulpenstraße, a little old building home to the 200-year old Der Lindenbaum Gaststätte which had just begun to close for the night. He climbed up yet another three flights of stairs to his apartment and stuck a key in a plain red door with a metal number 3 hammered into the center at eye-level. In one fluid motion, he entered the room, flicked on the lights, and disrobed his trench coat at the same time. The small bag under his arm was dark blue with a small golden latch at the top between the handles. He made his way through the small barren living room through a cracked bedroom door, once again simultaneously pushing the door open as he turned on the light. However, the door was stopped by my shoe as I hid against the wall behind it. Before he could react to the loud thump, I sprung out from behind the door, shoved him onto the dressing beside him, and muffled a shot to the head with one of his own pillows I held against his bald skull. Like his stunt at the door that left his trench coat slumped on the ground, this was a similarly fluid motion that left the bald-headed man slumped against his dresser. His body slipped off of the dresser as I held on to the blue tote bag, his arm limply passing through the straps as his body fell to the ground with a dull thud. I turned out the lights with my gloved hands as I stepped out of the bedroom, with the tote bag now positioned under my arm. As I made my way toward the exit, I decided to sit on his couch to recollect myself. I've done this for several years now yet I still find myself slightly shook-up. I guess that means I'm still somewhat human. I guess I should explain myself for killing a man in cold blood. In my defense, I knew this bald little man was a menace. I mean, who goes to a pitch-black room without the intention of doing something lewd and sinister that the public eye would look down upon? And what better a place to hide than in plain sight? Of course, this man would n't stoop down low enough to make it blatantly obvious to everyone around him. That would break the illusion for the unsuspecting who do n't know where to look. Of course, I've been doing this for quite some time, and I knew exactly where to look when I saw through the cracks in the seats an exchange of letters to a man to his left. Either this man was an excellent actor, or honestly enjoyed watching silent films and lacked professionalism in his operations. Through a few hearty chuckles, I noticed two separate envelopes, one emerging from the bald man's coat and another making it's way into it. Which, upon remembering that tidbit of information, I made my way towards the coat and grabbed the envelope from an inner pocket. On the wax seal was an emblem of an eagle surrounded by a circle of short dashes pointing towards the center. The envelope itself was blank, with it's crucial content meant to be kept sealed by the wax, as per the order from my superiors. Following to his home was n't too incredibly difficult, especially when you already know this man personally. It's a shame to see him slumped over like that, but the bastard had it coming. I noticed frost building on the window outside, so I decided to make use of the dead man's coat. I picked it up off of the ground, dusted it off, and placed it on my shoulders as I arranged all of the man's parcels as I had before. It seems like I definitely fit the part, aside from the full head of hair. But at least I know that anyone who may be expecting the bald man's emergence from the apartment to confirm some sort of exchange with another conspirator would be satisfied. I got that inclination after finding a similarly dressed man waiting in the dark, who is now laying bloodied and lifeless in the kitchen just out of bald man's distracted line of sight, obscured only by a small breakfast bar. In this little cat-and-mouse chase around the streets of Einsamburg, it's sometimes crucial to pass on the baton like a little relay race in the world of intrigue and espionage, but rather than losing the race, you only lose your life if the opponent manages to stay a few steps ahead. I made my way towards the bald man's companion after adjusting the trench coat, snatching his dark-grey homburg and plopping the slightly oversized hat on my head. As long as I do n't bend over, it should n't be a problem and any other of his buddies out there in the shadows should be none the wiser. I finally made my way towards the door, looking back at the door of an occupied bedroom. A bit of rage overcame me, and I hissed at the corpse: \" Rot in hell, you back-stabbing bastard.\" And after flicking a switch, closing the door, and descending down the stairs, I made my way toward the train station, where I took the northern route to a rendezvous point by the river. After a brief exchange with code words and whatnot, the baton was passed and the race continued on a different leg in the opposite direction. And with that, the burden was off my shoulder and what had been lost was finally found again. I made my way back to the station, sticking my hand to briefly check on the envelope perched in my coat pocket.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Behind the words plays the same time-lapsed video of me in that sterile little room - you've seen it, I'm sure, with those obnoxiously disquieting white walls - and I'm pontificating, then espousing, then preaching, then blustering, and eventually drooling about something that is all pasted into an abortion of a montage like it all came out of my mouth at the same time. \" There's a nerve cluster in the center of the brain,\" you can hear me saying. \" Hypo-\" Fade-out. \" Glypo-\" Swipe-out. \" Lypo-\" Checkerboard or blur, depending on your viewing region. \" Gobbledygook-\" Freeze frame. \" Uh-\" Slow, meandering swirl pattern. \" Uh-\" Close-up. \" I'm special.\" Fade to black. \" Laaaaaaaaaa\" Yeah, that's me over the course of about sixteen hours. The entire session lasted a full twenty four, but for the first eight the words that came out of my mouth were so obnoxiously brilliant that the government censored them for security purposes. Then, eight hours in, when my IQ had diminished to the level of super-genius, the filming resumed. That's what you're watching on that god-forsaken documentary. Me at only sixty-six percent capacity. Anterosavamnesia. I'd say it's like a bad Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore romcom, but, hey, they're all bad, and they already made it. It's called Retar-Thirty. It has one of the lowest ratings ever, yet made more money at the box office than Frozen. That's my life: A Sandler-Barrymore romcom. At least Tyler Perry's version, Madea Goes Stupid, got the facts straight. But we all know what people say about that documentary, and it's the same thing you're probably thinking now: I am so insensitive to those with real learning disabilities, and I should be ashamed of myself for making light of their situation.

Still, that's not why you're reading this. Honestly, none of you actually care what comes out of my mouth in the morning, only what I spit out at night. And yes, the innuendo is not lost on me, you and your filthy mind. I cured cancer, you know? And aids? And every other bane of existence - It's done. I did it before I ate breakfast. I woke up today and thought to myself, Bertha, you bright one you, whatever shall you do today to redeem yourself in the eyes of your lesser. And I asked myself, why, dear Bertha, what ails the common folk? I do n't know why, but I find myself talking like characters on Downtown Abby in the morning, and by the time I'm nice and stupid, like I'm a cast member on Big Bang Theory. I'm certain that means something. Anyway, I pontificated, what shall I do today? And I resolved to cure cancer. I jotted down the solution, made a few phone calls, and since that only took ten minutes, I cured AIDS too. And you know what thanks I get? You want to know how you, the benefactors of my generosity, thank me? You do n't want me to get married. That's right.

The news broke sometime in the morning. By noon, everyone knew. I wish I could say I saw it coming – I had to – but I still felt as numb as ever when I caught wind of it. Nothing could have prepared me for the silent judgment. I've always worked my hardest to stay invisible. It's been my specialty after years of practice. After all, I've never wanted the others to see me. Then they would know I was different. Maybe it was fine for our ancestors on Earth but not here. There were different rules. A hand fell on my shoulder. I would have jumped had I not recognized the touch – light, yet firm at the same time. Any other day, it would have placed the goofiest grin on my face. Today, I kept my scowl. \" Captain, \" I said before shoveling a spoonful of the gray matter in my mouth. It was bitter. Roth flinched. He always said he hated when I referred to him by his title. \" There's no need to keep up appearances now, \" he whispered. \" If you hadn't noticed, we're the talk of the ship. \" I looked up frowning. As he said, the room had gone silent, all eyes on us. I shivered, my skin crawling. It had been a long time since it didn't require yelling to talk in mess hall of the S.S Infinity. \" \" Right, \" I sighed. \" I hardly ever noticed. \" Roth pulled my sleeve, tilting his head in the direction of an empty hallway. \" Come on. We need to talk. \" It didn't take much to convince me. I'd rather spend my time with him than being stared at like I had grown a third head. Then again, as far as they cared that would be far more favorable. Roth escorted me through the minefield of wary glances. I kept my eyes down as usual, attempting to keep my breaths steady I could let them see my fear. Not there, not like that. Before I knew it, the two of us had successfully made it. The air in the corridor seemed cooler – at least enough to soothe my burning neck. Roth appeared the same, wiping his sweat-glossed forehead. Was he afraid too? No, he wasn't afraid of anything. \" So, how are you doing? \" I bit the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood. \" Are you serious? All this and you're going to ask how I am? \" \" Sorry. \" Roth frowned. His verdant eyes dulled. \" I was just trying to lighten the mood. \" I sighed, pinching the bridge of nose. The hum of the machine was all that could fill the silence. That, and the occasional clack of a plate from the mess hall. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone gathered around the hallway's mouth to spy on our conversation. \" No, I'm sorry, \" I said. \" I'm just… I don't really know what I am right now. All I know is today has been a nightmare. \" \" Tell me about it, \" Roth said, nodding. \" My heart feels like it's going to beat so fast it'll explode. \" I gave a slight chuckle, placing a hand on his chest. As he said, a steady thump hammered against my palm. \" I must admit, I never thought I'd see the day that Captain Roth Engel would be intimidated by a little gossip. \" I smirked. \" Well, I did kinda drop a bombshell on pretty much all of age women on the ship. Every one of them must have been fighting for years to bear my children. Now, they realized all their work has gone to waste. \" \" Good riddance. \" I paused, running a hand through my hair. \" So, what does that mean for us? Is this going to be the end? \" Roth snorted, shaking his head. The skin around his eyes crinkled ever-so-slightly. Just the way that I fell for him all those years ago. \" Let them be upset, \" he said. \" We shouldn't be ashamed of ourselves. Sure, they thought they eradicated any chance of homosexuality on our ship but we slipped through the cracks. I think the crew can go without two more kids for the next generation. And if not, there will be at least a dozen more before the ship makes it to its destination. What we should focus on is the now – us being together. \" I couldn't help but smile. \" My, someone has really gotten over their fears quickly, huh? \" Roth placed both his hands on my shoulders and pulled me close, just enough for his beating heart to lull my anxiety away. He leaned down and whispered in my ear, lightly swaying. \" Maybe all I needed was a reason to fight for. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

This would have been funny if it was n't so embarrassing. We're the third largest group of Vampire hunters on the east coast... and we ALL got infected in the space of just a month. See I could deal with it - you adjust to Garlic with enough time. But the rest of them... amateurs! After a'vote'everyone agreed to do missions more interdependently to work around'adjusting their style'to keep the edge over the night-stalkers. Which was great, but then I realized it meant they never got used to hiding their new found'gifts'and urges until the monthly all-hands meet-up yesterday afternoon. Awkward was an understatement. Half of them turned up late until just after sun-down due to a whole tonne of excuses, Mary had trouble getting instate due to traffic. Johns car broke down - which is funny because he arrived in bat-form, but he's lucky I was the only one who saw him. So here we are having a meet up of twenty vampire hunters, so we order pizza for all and much to my amusement, there was free garlic bread as a surprise. Oh lord I nearly burst into laughter and gave the game away - the mix of terrified and repulsed look on their face... oh it was beautiful. Not a single one knew how to make a good excuse, a few just faked receiving calls and outright fled. After that, I decided I'd wait until the next meet to give them the news we're ALL vampires now, so we can stop pretending and work out what we're going to do. But it did n't stop me having my fun. I'accidentally'split the free garlic-dip all over one of the pizzas. I knew from experience it was just flavoring and none of it was real but everyone else did n't know what to do - the month before they'd all loved that dip, so they knew they did n't have an excuse. So they were forced to finish it none the less. Dave and Mary both worked out they were n't allergic to the dip quick enough, but oh poor Fred... He bit around the dip perfectly, avoiding it so it never touched him. I did n't even need to act - Mary jokingly shoved it up in his face and smushed the pizza -and dip- all over him, with the smell of garlic in his nose he was petrified he was about to come out in the distinctive boils Vampires come out in. So he yelped and ran to the bathroom as quick as he could to clean up. What's best is when we started drinking. What a lot of hunters do n't know, is vampires ARE N'T immune to the effects of alcohol, contrary to popular belief. So they were all far more brave with their drinking games than they should be... right up to the point when they realized although they were trashed. It's a good thing they were all so drunk, or they'd have seen the other flit about with unnatural speed to fetch the remaining slices of pizza, John passing out... as a bat -who I took to my bedroom and out of sight-. Comically they bit each other a fair amount, but due to the Vampire regeneration, they healed too quickly for it to leave marks - so what would have otherwise killed them if they were human lead to them surviving the drunken shenanigans. I finished the night up with one last bottle of wine'punch', mixed with blood and a heavy anesthetic that could knock out even a vampire. We all cheers and drunk up -except me- and I went to clean about their mess.

I have remarkably good aim. The way they mewl and run is balm to my soul. Hateful black-hearted creatures from hell. That night I walked home after a drunken binge at the bar. The streetlights had a halo to them and the streets flowed like a meandering river. How would I know that wasn't a cat? I thought I saw a cat and threw my beer bottle at it. The bottle smashed a foot in front of it and the cat like thing jumped.

I washed till I looked like a steamed lobster, and yet the soap didn't come off. Pissed off and promising myself I would call the soap company, I dried the soapy suds off. I brushed my teeth and then dressed for work. As I walked to the elevator, I saw the pretty girl next door leaving her apartment. I was working up the courage to talk to her for months, but the sheer brightness of her beauty defeated me every time. I smiled at her. She smiled back at me. My heart stopped, well, almost.

I walked in after her and the moment we started moving, I let out a loud, noxious fart. It was involuntary. The thing stank the whole space with the worst smell I ever smelled. She looked pained. To be honest, she looked ready to throw up. I apologized, but the moment the door opened, she ran out like the devil was after her. I didn't mind. I was kinda proud of the fart. It was a once in a lifetime fart. One that you would tell your grandchildren about. Well, as it turns out, it wasn't. Every time I step in an elevator with anyone in it, I rip one out. No matter how hard I try to stop it, it escapes. It is loud and it is stinky and it makes everyone's eyes water. And yeah, about the soap thing. It only washes off after I take a real cold shower for fifteen minutes. I counted. At 14:59, I am soapy and bubbly, and at 15:00 I am clean as a whistle. Shivering like heck, but soapless.

Maybe the ketchup I spilled on my shirt was it. Maybe the indigestion I got from beer? I don't know. I wish I get to know soon. Wondering about it keeps me up at night. Maybe that is it?

He handed me his lighter and I noticed how quiet he was so I asked him what was up and he said he came out to his parents last night. Now I never had any problem with gays before and besides I'd already known that Johnny was bi since he's still been keeping contact with us and I did n't care I mean they're my friends no matter what. The thing was that when I asked him how he knew he said that him and Johnny had been fooled around in our freshmen year. It was something I was annoyed about because I would n't have cared if they told me about it but I decided to let it go I did n't really care too much about it we were all still good freinds and all. Things were normal as between for the rest of our sophomore and junior years, we hung out and ragged on each other together and during the summer Johnny would come and visit and he'd tell us about how fucking dull it was out west without us but the good weed they had out there helped, we all had a good laugh about that. When our Senior year started Johnny had to start school about two weeks earlier than us but we did our best to enjoy ourselves without him around. Once Johnny left we fell back into our normal routine and it was about as much fun as could be had in a scholastic setting. About half way through the school year Seth let something out that at the time I never saw coming. I remember Seth and I were walking home in the rain and he was being really quiet he had n't said anything all day. Even back then I always knew when there was something on his mind. We were almost at my house he finally said something \" Hey umm Kevin can I tell you something.\" I could tell he was nervous and he was blushing a bit too at the time I thought it was kind of weird but looking back he did look cute with his dark wet hair slicked back and the raindrops on his glasses. \" Yeah what's up man.\" I said kind of nervous what he might tell me. \" Kevin I really like you a lot... I mean more than just friends I love you, I've known for the longest time that I've had feelings for you...\" I remember he was beginning to get teary eyed \" I know you might never feel the same way but-but I-I.\" I stopped him and just held him for a while on the street corner and when he said he was ok I told him to go home and rest. We did n't talk to each other that weekend and we pretty much avoided each other for a while in school. I remember feeling bad for avoiding him but at the same time I was n't really sure what I'd say to him. It was a few weeks before we hung out again and it was still kind of awkward but eventually we talked it out and I came to understand that he'd have feelings for me and he understood that he'd most likely never get to act on those feelings. Soon enough we graduated and immediately signed up for college and Johnny came back to the east to go to a film school in Boston which was n't too far away from where we were going. We lived on campus and most of the time and Johnny spending the night on our couch pretty much became the norm. We did all the things that every young adult does in their college days party, drink, study, rinse and repeat. Not much really happened besides Johnny and Seth hooking up and I saw that coming, I did n't care at all they eventually got an apartment together in Boston and I found my own place in a city not too far away. I made a living doing exactly what I wanted to almost as soon as I finished school. I started as a freelance artist with a local art collective making advertisment pieces for local business and flyers for local bands and selling my own pieces for what I could on the side. It was n't too long however that Seth and Johnny had a mutual break up, he had to go back out west because he landed a big corporate job. Seth had to move in with me since he could n't afford the rent at his Boston apartment by himself and I already was making enough to support myself and had an extra room. So for the next few years we both dated people while living together neither of us minded having the others partner hanging around from time to time. Eventually I ended up putting a stop to dating for the longest time after breaking up with one girl. Seth did n't have too much luck himself I guess a lot of guys had a problem with him living with a guy who he had feelings for since high school. That always sort of made me feel guilty because he'd always drink a lot when someone he really liked broke up with him and he is n't exactly a graceful drunk. Johnny on the other hand seemed to be doing well for himself, he'd come to visit when ever he came back east for work. I remember the last time he visited us before me and Seth got together. Me and him went out to the bars while Seth was working and we both just talked about how things were going. \" So how are things out in Cali.?\" I asked as we ordered our first round of drinks. \" They're good, I'm happy out there the pay is good I'm in a solid relationship at the moment, how about you?\" \" I'm doing fine on the money front but not so much on the whole love thing.\" \" That's too bad, women am I right?\" He said nudging me which made me smirk \" Yeah I hear you.\" \" So how's Seth doing?\" \" He's doing about the same as me, I guess his money situation is doing good but he's gotten in some shitty relationships.\" \" That's too bad, he still does that thing where he drinks himself stupid after they leave him?\" I let out a sigh \" Yeah, and I always kinda feel bad about it I mean most of the guys he dates get freaked out when they find out he's living with someone he's had a crush on since the day he came out.\" John let out his own sigh now \" Yeah that's why he would n't go out with me when he first came out.\" he said in a somewhat defeated tone \" What you mean you knew how he felt about me and never told me?\" \" I did n't think it was my place, I certainly gave him a push in the right the direction. I thought you deserved to know.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

And you know what I've figured out? Society does n't care about anybody.\" We stood in silence for a moment, the icy wind cutting through the alley chilling us to the bone.

I'm homeless, and the only person to actually offer anything good, is contemplating killing me. *Things were pretty fucked up. * \" I hope you can understand why.\" I finally admitted. The grin faded finally, and he seemed to take that in for some time. \" So...\" The man began, \" You admit it's your fault you ended up this way.\" \" Who else's could it be?\" I noted. \" True, you made the mistakes.\" He smirked again, \" And society burned you for it.\" \" Society does n't *give a single fuck about anybody in it. * You are n't fucking human if you do n't have money in your pocket.

I'm guessing a chain smoker; you have nicotine in your teeth. That's your vice right?\" His analysis unnerved me, though I did n't show it. I was doing the same to him. Mid-40's, possibly divorced. No wedding ring. Expensive suit, but the trenchcoat is heavy duty. He has n't done anything, but I know how he carries himself. He knows some shit, and I can tell he could hurt someone real bad if he needed to.

I'm glad you're entertained.\" \" In that case, I've made my decision.\" He said. I watched him brush back his coat on the other side of his person. I could only freeze as I noted the metal sticking out of the beltline. He reached in his coat pocket instead. Before long, he handed me a stack of cold, hard, fresh-pressed cash. He let me hold it in my hands. I flicked the bills. Real. They're real. \" That's 5,000 dollars.\" He noted, \" In your hand. Tell you what. Get a cheap phone. And call this number.\" I glanced up to him; only to for him to hand me a card. \" What is this?\" \" You want your life back?\" He said as he began to move away, \" Here's your chance. Get some sleep, a shower, and shave. You have potential; and it all starts tomorrow if you call that number.\" \" What about this?\" I yelled after him. \" You earned it. Keep in touch.\" He yelled back. I watched him until he was out of sight. I tucked the money away, and stood for a moment.

They both froze and watched the child for some time but she did nothing other than stand at the end of their bed. Mrs. Smith tentatively snuck out of the bed, being careful not to make any sudden moves and retrieved a checkers set and put it at the end of the bed in front of the apparition. The apparition set up the board and whined \" I want someone to play with.\" \" What happened to you?\" Mrs. Smith asked. \" I want someone to play with\" replied the apparition. Mrs. Smith played a game of checkers with the child and then told her that Mrs. Smith needed to sleep right now and that the child should go away. The child did n't go away but she did n't do anything to interfere with the Smiths sleeping either. The next day Mr. and Mrs. Smith researched the history of the house. It seems that in the 50's a child had been raped and murdered in that house. A husband and wife with a little girl had rented a spare room to a student who had defiled the little girl and cut her throat. They brought in the priest, they brought in the psychics and the ghost hunters but still the little girl appeared at the end of their bed saying \" I want someone to play with\". Finally Mrs. Smith said to the little girl \" If I give you someone to play with will you protect her against harm always? Will you make sure that what happened to you never happens to her?\" The little girl's face brightened for the first time and said \" I want someone to play with\". So the next day Mr. and Mrs. Smith announced the exciting news to their daughter that she was going to move into the big bedroom. They'd equipped the room with swings and a slide coming off the bunk bed and a doll house and 2 exercise bikes and a tent and every game they could think of. On the daughter's first night in the room the little girl appeared and announced \" I want someone to play with.\" so the two girls swung on the swings and played checkers and dressed the dolls and finally the daughter had to go to bed to sleep. This went on for some time until one day the daughter said \" Mommy, Daddy, every night a ghost comes to my bedroom\" and her parents replied \" Yes, honey, that's why that room is yours.\" Dark twist if you want: One day the washing machine flooded and Mrs. Smith called a plumber. The plumber came into the house and while Mrs. Smith was pottering around the house he said to the daughter \" You're a pretty little girl, are n't you?\" The daughter was embarrassed and shy. The plumber waited till Mrs. Smith went outside to do some work in the garden and said to the daughter \" Why do n't you come and sit on my lap and let me stroke your hair.\" He was alarmed when a small bloodied girl appeared at the doorway and said \" I want someone to play with.\" The electrician confirmed to the coroner that the plumber's death was due to an electrical fault coming in contact with water.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

No messages left, no instructions, just gone, everyone was gone. At first Nathaniel had coped well with the situation. Mentally exhausted from people and life in general, this new found solitude was almost welcomed. For four months Nathaniel fulfilled all of his carnal pleasures.

He had become numb to the tropes that inevitably arise in all movies. He stopped watching them all together. He stopped doing much of anything really. A year had passed to the date.

As he drank his last bear and gazed down at the open medication container lids, a peculiar thing happened. He heard a voice. \" Dear god Nathaniel, why would you do this, we could've helped you\", a woman's voice sobbed hysterically in Nathaniel's head. But before he had time to process the situation, his world began to dim and swirl around him. He was finally leaving the pain behind, the loneliness, the isolation, it was all going to go away. The world faded to black and his existence finally ended. A bright light cast light through Nathaniel's eyelids. \" Am I dead? I should n't be thinking\" he thought to himself. He attempted to open his eyes but the pain from the light was too much. Then he started to smell a strange odor. Sterile, clean, definitely the smell of alcohol. Sounds started to become audible. Chatter between people and a rhythmic beeping. He finally had adjusted to the light and opened his eyes. Lying down, Nathaniel became extremely confused. He was in a hospital, connected to various equipment. How long had he been asleep he thought. A girl sitting in the corner of the room looked up and saw him awake. Without hesitation she stood up, dashed across the room, and began sobbing uncontrollably on his chest. \" I didnt know you were that upset, do n't ever leave me again, you're safe now\" she said as she quietly sobbed on his chest.

Anger started to build in me, only to be eclipsed by that hunger. \" Jake, \" I yelled. \" Settled down! \" He kept barking and whining. Eventually, I could no longer relax in my shower. I needed to calm Jake down and I needed to eat. I shut the water off and slipped out from the tub. I threw the door open to the bathroom to see what Jake was barking and whining at. He was facing the bathroom door, whining at me. Me? I turned my head to see if something was off that would make him act so strangely to his owner. There was something missing about me this morning. I could see in the reflection of the mirror the bright red being staring at me, eye sockets barely holding two bulging eyes staring with concern, then panning down to observe of the rest of that form that was once human, but now lacked a crucial trait: Skin. I had no skin. Before I could process this, the hunger took me again and I needed to fill my belly. Slowly, I looked back to Jake, and he whined at me. He whined like cornered prey.

She could n't make out where the moon was until the first meteor blasted through the cloud layer, streaking into the distant north.

Word had arrived informing Agent Mays and the rest of the team that one of the United States most important assets, Matt Damon, had been beheaded just hours ago. They could not afford to lose their primary figurehead, Bill Cosby. \" What are the launch codes Mr.Cosby.\" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was pacing the room, stopping intermittantly at Cosby's chair where he his hands were taught with rope. \" Zippity bop, in the pudding pop.\" Cosby slyly spoke. al-Baghdadi was growing tired of Cosby's senseless words. One of his henchman stepped forward and lashed Cosby in the chest with a whip as Cosby bellowed in pain. \" I will ask you one last time, before executing you like your worthless comrade.\" Matt Damons body could be seen strewn on the ground, adorned in assless chaps.

He flexed yet again, this time with immense power radiating from his body. The chair underneath him shattered as he slowly stood from his sitting position.

Slowly, David struggled to sit up, leaning slightly to the right and then onto his bed rest. He felt nauseous - the world swirled around him; the heat in the centre of his head overwhelming his thoughts. But something was happening downstairs. He had to stay awake. What was going on? He heard the kitchen door creak open and David knew it. Someone was in his house. And it wasn't Maria; the Maria he knew took louder and heavier steps. The sound of silent footsteps faintly reached his ear; no, this wasn't Maria, this was a robber. David looked outside. It was dark, and rain drops were stained against the tinted glass. He must have slept through the storm. He looked around his bed and found the book he was reading before he fell asleep. A dim, wavering candle, about to extinguish into the sea of wax. And on his bedside table, the phone sitting on the cradle. A tinkling of metal came from below. The intruder was rummaging through his cutlery… for a knife, perhaps? But who would want to kill him? Perhaps it was the incident last week, though it was unlikely. He was playing his weekly poker, and had been in a massive fight about not being able to pay money. Chairs were broken. Tables were flipped. Glasses were smashed. The pub owner kicked both of them out, only to detriment of himself. Outside, he was beaten up, made to promise to the deep, raspy voice that he would pay by tomorrow, otherwise he would face the consequences. But how could he pay? He was dragged to a nearby clinic, only to be put in his bed with packets of painkillers. Only time can heal, they said. So Maria, his lovely sister, took leave off her job and came to take care of him. She's probably home right now, he thought. The bottom step creaked sharply, piercing through his thoughts. Then the second. The whines of wood came faster and faster. With all his might, David reached out for the telephone. He could nearly reach the dial, his arm stretched out with all his might. He rolled and shuffled to the side, his hand getting closer and closer, and THUD. No, the sound didn't come from the intruder. David found himself face down, his face up against the wooden floor planks, knowing that his only help was high above his head, out of his reach. Even the cold clammy surface would n't wake him up. His arm burned from the impact, and he felt a warm sensation run down his nose, and his eyes started to blur. Behind him, a deep, raspy voice cut through David's visions. \" Game over \".

Are there any questions?\" The silence of the room spoke for the 18 candidates. \" You may begin.\" The examiner was an elderly woman, wrinkles pruning her face. Her resting face was something of a fascination of mine as she read aloud the instructions. With a crooked nose, I thought she might just be out of a story you read as a child. Blemishes on her face stared at me, as I picked up the pencil. But it was n't a pencil. It was a small metal rod that was coloured in the style of a pencil. I attempted to write a letter. All that came out was a surprised look on my face. I glanced up at the examiner. Through the rose coloured glasses, she stared at my pencil, reflecting my expression of surprise. I glanced around to see the other seventeen candidates. My glance returned to the tiny rod. It was sharp, but not sharp enough to penetrate skin. Looking at the paper, a single line on the paper read, \" Explain the meaning of this examination.\" However, given that I was the only one not writing anything and ten minutes had gone by, I began to wonder. The instructions included not to move from your seat, lest I be subject to many punitive measures. They also mentioned fairly nonchalantly that the metal plate would sound the alarm if I were to remove myself from the table. *Furthermore*, the examiner had the right to remove any of us to the execution chamber if we removed ourselves from the seat voluntarily. The pencil's appeal, the heavy weight of the small yellow rod, the black tipped end made it seem that the only way to write anything was to penetrate my own skin to gain ink of some sort. Alternatively, I could murder the old woman. But that would require my being off of this seat. Finally, I thought of the last option, which was self-harm to end it all here. Naturally, none of these options were particularly appealing, so I raised my hand and calmly said, \" May I please leave the room to be executed?\" The old woman's right hand went to her ear, as if picking at something. Her old cow eyes, a dull blue and gray looked into mine and simply replied, \" Yes. Please follow me.\" I stood up. To my surprise, I did n't feel any shock, nor did any other painful measure came to me. My eyes met the examiners'once more. \" Please follow me this way to the gas chambers.\" I followed. The heavy door creaked as it punctuated it's closure with a loud *boom*. As soon as we were out of the door, and the door shut, the old woman said, \" Thank you dear. Now, please lock the door.\" Confused, I shut the lock, pushing the rusty bolt to it's final resting position. \" Oh, I hope you brought that metal pencil.\" \" Why is that?\" I hesitated. I had place the pencil in my pocket when we had left. \" Because, you will start the second part of the test with it.\" Looking back at the door, I mentioned, \" But do n't you have to look after the other candidates?\" \" No. That room only has about 1 hour of air for 17 people.

He is in the middle of a song, which he sings for the little Boy and Girl, seated atop little mismatched plastic booster-chairs in the back seat. ( He over-enunciates, and rolls his R's. He is the perfect showman, all the while. ) If he had more time to think, he would want to apologize to them for this: For not driving slower, for the rain, for singing, and for not watching. Here are the Children. The Boy and Girl are six and four, respectively, and will remain as such for the rest of their lives. Their eyes are wider, even, than the surprised eyes of their Father. Time and gravity have done nothing to them. They are in the back seat, and can not see the Truck. The Boy, if he knew, would have tried to look brave, as he believes himself to be very a very brave person. ( He watched a movie with a dragon once, and did n't even flinch when it roared. ) Given time, this opinion might have come true. The Girl, who is still laughing at the Father's deep, rumbling song-voice, does not know. If she did, she would still not understand, but would probably cry, all the same. She is very sensitive ( one time falling into tears when her classmate informed her that the classmate's family Dog had died ) and cries easily. They will never know.

He does not notice the dark green minivan traveling in the opposite direction, that has begun to swerve, just barely. Here is the image of the Highway as it will be forever, before the flares are put up, before the ambulances arrive, strobing red and white.

The greatest Stradivarius sat beside the cheapest violin, the same in our eyes. I stood by the instruments, watching the children run by. Always, they came for field trips to learn about the death of music. Ridiculous. How could you teach them how much of a loss music was? They'd never known it. Already I see them slipping on ear buds and listening to podcasts. Well,'podcasts'. I use the term lightly, it's all inane babble about the latest trends, interwoven with a healthy supply of advertisements. I'm ashamed to admit it, but those tracks got me through the lonely nights in the museum, so there was some merit to them. I sigh, and run my finger over a display guitar. The art of making the instruments had n't been lost, and they left a couple of models out for people to try out. Watch as the strings rattled and vibrated, yet no sound ever came out. I thought it disrespectful, frankly, and had n't done it yet. I was n't going to revel in the death of music. As I turned to leave, my finger caught on one of the strings, and a soft tone sounded out. The museum immediately came to a hush, rowdy children glancing up in curiosity, old men looking up from their newspapers in hope. I glanced about the room, and took a step back. \" No, no,\" the curator stepped over, his walking stick clacking on the ground. God, why did he have to be here today? \" Come, boy, try it,\" he lifted the guitar up to my hands. His eyes were filled with trepidation, as if he did n't dare hope. He drew a pick from his wallet, where it had been for decades, and handed it to me too. I lifted my hands to the guitar, mimicking the pose I'd seen often in the old videos and photos. George Marius, the curator, had been an orchestral conductor once, and I suppose I owed it to him to at least try. Also, he was my boss, and I rather liked my job. Tentatively, carefully, I took the pick from his hands, and began to play. I'd spent time pantomiming playing to sheet music before, and the guitar began to play. What ensued was the most terrible, screeching caterwaul, that made me wish I had never been blessed with the sense of hearing. A sound so horrific, the loss of all music was justified if only it had managed to rid the world of this. George took it from my hands, and walked away. He was n't angry, I think, just disappointed. The reason I could play the guitar was because none of the sounds my hands conjured could come close to being considered music.

Jake brandished his sword at me, saying \" Do n't question, just follow along!\" in a voice that sounded like a high-pitched tea kettle, nothing like the deep, soothing voice I knew him for. I wondered where this new voice came from. \" Show yourself, trickster!\" I shouted at the nearby bushes. \" It's not a trick, it's me, the author!\" the voice squeaked. \" You're ruining the story with your ceaseless questions. I'll have to instruct you myself.\" Jake and I rode onward to a neighboring town without interruption, coming to a halt at the town gates, where a mob of townsfolk had gathered. As they spotted us, they began to plead for our services. \" Oh, brave knights, wo n't you help us lowly peasants kill the mighty dragon who plagues the land?\". Jake vowed to slay the fearsome dragon in return for the town's fairest maiden, a demand to which I erupted in protest. \" Really? You do n't even know if she loves you! What would your wife think of your adultery?\" I said as he drew his sword in response. \" Daddy's has some needs that Mommy ca n't take care of sometimes, so he visits other Mommies.\" the author responded. \" Mommy does n't like this, so she went away. There she is now!\" he said, forcing me to point at the incoming scaly beast. Bizarrely, rather than having a dragon's maw, its head was that of a plump, brunette 40 year-old woman. \" Kill the beast!\" the author said, his voice breaking. Thinking quickly, I ripped Jake's weapon from his gloves, responding to his bewildered face with \" The dragon has n't hurt anyone! The town is spotless! There was n't any danger!\" This infuriated the author, prompting him to remedy the situation. Despite the protests of every fiber of my being, I returned Jake's sword through gritted teeth. With a triumphant roar, he plunged the sword deep into the dragon's face, wetting the ground in blood. \" Die, die, die!\" the author said with glee as Jake slashed at the corpse, emitting flares that set the town alight. \" See? The dragon *did* burn the village!\" hr crowed. \" That was all you!\" I said, bringing the hilt of my sword down on his nose. He scrambled to his feet, protesting that it was an accident and that he did n't mean to burn the village. \" Do n't you leave me too!\" he sobbed as I stormed off. I wanted the kid to use the story as a way of dealing with his father's adultery, which caused his parents to divorce. The kid blames himself for the divorce, which the main character's protests represents. Hope that came across.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "Over night, 90 % of the world's population has dropped dead. In the following weeks, the survivors, who come from diverse countries, ethnicities, religious beliefs and lifestyles realize that they all share a single, peculiar trait...", "output": "I have n't seen a living person in a week. In fact, it might have been longer. Honestly I have no idea. It was the strangest thing. I woke up and everyone was dead. Just gone. I'll tell you what happened the first day. I live alone in an apartment, and I woke up like any other day. Sun in the window. I make my coffee, and everything just smells metallic. The coffee smell overpowers that though. I sit down to drink it staring into the soft brown liquid, and a bright red drop falls in my cup. Now you can see how this would bother me, I was quite distraught. I look up and it drips on my lip. There's a bright red liquid dripping from the ceiling. I smell it, and immediately confirm my suspicion. It was blood. What was blood doing in the air vents? This could n't be good. I wipe it off my face, and cringe running out into the hall. What I saw was the most horrific thing I have ever seen. The walls were painted red. It was like they'd all exploded. Blood hung in the air like a thick mist, and my white collared shirt turned red instantly. Just skeletons on the ground. Unrecognizable. That's all about that day that I care to talk about. Lets get back to the present. I got the hell out of the city. I could n't handle the skeletons. Let me get this straight with you: I have n't seen people in weeks by choice. I stay in my home in the woods. I've become something of a hermit trying to get over what I saw. I built a shelter out of mud like that guy who used to make those videos. You know the one. The primitive guy, Primitive technology, I think. God, I cant remember anymore. I cant remember shit. I keep seeing a woman in the woods. Well, not really a woman, it's a little girl. She comes around, and says some weird psycho stuff about how we have magic blood. Kind of creepy, but its mostly just sad. She has to be out of her mind. The girl probably watched her parents explode. I give her food if she comes around, but she does n't eat it. I mostly just sit in my little mud hut, and meditate. \" Am I terrible that I have n't went to see my family? Am I terrible for not looking for my parents? I honestly could n't bear to see if they were dead. I'd rather just assume they are alive.\" I hear in the distance as I meditate in my hut. I do n't want them to find me. I want them to leave me alone. I climb a tree grabbing my nylon rope leaping softly through the trees to the voice. They have n't seen me. I feel the same way. I do n't know how my parents are either. \" You are n't terrible. They would n't want to put you through the pain of seeing them that way either.\" The male voice says to her. They're well equipped. They could be raiders. Probably not though. I set a loop of rope on the ground for their feet and wait in the tree for them to walk in my trap. They are n't on a main trail. We'll have a moment to talk before I have to let them go. This is how I get most of my information. There's a warlord to the east of me, and some form of democracy founded by the some of the old rich people in the city to my west. We'll see who these people are. I jump down from the tree holding the other end of the rope as they're pulled up by their feet to be at eye level with me. They both scream, and the man vomits. \" Not terrible, no. Not by my judgement, but you're in the wrong part of the woods. What are you doing here?\" I look them both in the eyes. Holding a sharp stone in one hand, and the rope in the other. I must look crazy covered in mud, and blood as I am. I did n't bring a shirt to change into so I'm still wearing the white collared one. \" We are n't doing anything, but this forest is n't claimed by anyone that we've seen. We're traders. We live in a shelter underground.\" The man spits out almost as quickly as he spit out his lunch. The woman elbows him hard. \" We wo n't survive any longer in this fucking wasteland if you do n't stop telling everyone about the shelter.\" She yells at him elbowing him again in the ribs. She turns her gaze to me. \" let us down, or you going to be in a world of hurt.\" \" You're hardly in a position to bargain. I want nothing to do with your shelter. I just want you to stay out of the forest.\" I meet her gaze staring directly into her eyes almost as if to force the images I've seen into her eyes. She headbutts me quickly, and a flaming bird cuts my rope, so they fall to the ground. Flying straight for my chest, it hits, and flies through me burning my flesh. I lay on the ground struggling with my pain as they walk away. She punches him in the arm again, and I black out. *An Unknown Amount of Time Passes* I awaken in my hut. The little girl sitting next to me. My burn covered with leaves, and mud. I struggle to stand up, but am pushed back down embarrassingly easily. What was that? \" I can heal you, but its going to scar. You already know that though. Your soul is already scarred. I tried to tell you. We all have magic in our blood. Us Living Ones all have the potential to be Awakened.\" She whispers softly. \" What are you talking about?\" I ask not trying to get up again. What am I doing? This girl is crazy. I already know this. \" How did you get me here?\" \" I became a fish, and swam you here. Do n't you understand anything? Stupid spider, in your stupid web, with your stupid fear. Do n't be afraid of what you are.\" She slaps the burn on my chest, and I clench up for a moment before feeling better. I stand up feeling it, and pressing my hands to it. \" I'm not a spider? What are you talking about? Maybe if you'd explain yourself instead of talking in riddles then I could understand what you're trying to tell me.\" I ask standing up, and sitting on the floor. Surely this girl knows something, even if she is batshit crazy. \" You have magic in you. I have magic in me. Everyone still living in this world has magic. You're spirit is a spider, and mine is a fish. I can not teach you if you refuse to listen. Sleep.\" In that instant, a large beautiful beta fish floats in front of me, and I fall asleep.

Even if it is dirty.'said River, eyeing a smear on the console.'Hey! That's my gorram ship. Thankyouverymuch.'Time had not changed Malcolm Reynolds. His hair had greyed and that was it. The attitude, the bravado, and the coat. It had all remained the same.'If you say so, Captain!'she responded, sticking out her tongue.'I do say so because I am the Captain! Now. Who's first?''Kaylee and Simon! We're entering upper atmosphere now. Already pinged them with a wave.'Serenity sailed through the atmosphere with her usual grace. The kind of grace that a spaceship that was old during the battle between the Alliance and the Reavers can achieve now that decades had passed. That is to say, none whatsoever. A tell-tale thump and crash occurred.'Once. Just once I would like to meet guests with the whole of my ship intact, but no.'Reynolds moaned.'Maybe you should order it not to. Have you ever tried that?'inserted River with a snicker.'Well, are n't you just hilarious, Missy?'Reynolds paused,'Do you think it work though? I never tried it.'Serenity came about perfectly in Rivers hands. Same as it had always. Settled down easily. River had already launched herself from the cockpit to the bay. The years had done nothing to her; still as quick as ever. Opened the bay door and was running along. Childishly eager, she leapt from the ship and embraced her target.'It's so good to see you! It's been too long! How have you been?'exclaimed River.'Uhhh. Hello sweetie.'responded Kaylee meekly.'I'm glad to see you too, but...''Hello River.'said Dr Simon Tam.'It's not just Kaylee here, you know.''Yup!'said River,'Still boring. You got older Kaylee. What happened to you?''Like you said, I got older, honey. You have n't changed a bit though.'responded Kaylee.'I'll be inside. Unpacking. Where is the Captain?'asked Simon.'In the bay, go and see him. Please do n't get punched.'responded River,'I'm going to talk the Miss Frye!'Simon left with a blank facial expression before Kaylee broke the silence,'Uh, sweetie. It's Tam. I'm Mrs Tam now. I married your brother. I'm your sister.''Oh. Is that so?'replied a delighted River.'Then how come I've not changed and you've got old! We ca n't be related if you do n't share traits. Come on! I'm hungry, race you to lunch!'Rivers stomach had perfect timing as Mal's voice boomed from the ship, bolstered by the acoustics of the storage bay.'Get in the ship! Or I swear by all that is good and true and all that is n't, I will leave you here! Kaylee, fix my engine! It's been making noises.''Well! Back in we go.'said River,'Would n't want to keep you from that engine.'Kaylee's face lit up,'I ca n't believe I'm allowed to go and see her. It's been too long and we've got some catching up to do.'She strode away with purpose and a big smile on her face. Time had n't changed Zoe either. Her curly hair had n't been brave enough to grey and she strode onto the ship and let all the years fade away. Serenity had been her life for so long that everything was automatic. She spoke in short sentences, refused her old room and slept in the cargo bay, near the boxes. Some old cargo that was still due to be delivered. Inara had taken her possessions and fled Alliance space following the broadcast that Mal had made after he defeated the Operative. The Alliance had segmented and been disbanded. It's component planets declared independence and operated individually from one another. Discarding Alliance institutes, including the Companions. Her accumulated wealth permitted her peace, where she practiced her art and found solace in her faith. She had never married, fearing her life as a Companion would rise to the surface. There were still people unsympathetic to anything connected to the Alliance. She, as requested by Mal had met them all on a secluded stretch of land that the captain had used to stash goods since before the crew had even visited Miranda. Mal had been nervous the whole way.'How much longer is it going to be, River? I told you to get us there!'Mal complained.'It'll be another day the ship wo n't go any faster. Kaylee and I can do nothing. She might be happy to be back in that engine room but it's just too old now.'River said plainly.'Old? This ship is made of metal and luck and pure stubbornness. She does n't get to stop until I do. As for making it faster, what happened to you being a wonder child, huh?'retorted Mal, giving her his best scowl.'Wonder children ca n't change physics. I tried. It's more stubborn than this ship!'replied River, indignant at the insinuation.'Well, try harder gorramit. Has Inara checked in?''She'll be there as requested.''What about Jayne?''Jayne?''Yes, Jayne. Big, angry, likes guns, is good at fighting, thicker than milk left in the sun for a day. You opened his chest with a knife?''Oh yes! I talked to him earlier. Captain Jayne now. I wonder how Vera is?''You remember the rifle but not the man himself?''The rifle is prettier.''Ca n't argue with that.'Jayne Cobb had n't stayed with the Serenity for long after the battle. He had returned to Canton to start a full uprising. Not because of the people, but because he wanted the contents of the magistrates safe and his ship. Which he had taken and kept for himself. He'd called it Book. Deep down he had always respected Shepherd Book and his death marked the start of his own story as captain. He, like Inara. Had agreed to meet them at the requested place. It was a warm day on Hera. The wild tundra from decades past had given way to a lush hilly grassland. It was here they landed. In the middle of a valley, closely hugged by hills where no wind reached. It was sheltered, safe and out of the way.'Here we are Captain. This is the destination of the final flight of Serenity.'whispered River.'Alright then, River. You know what needs to be done.'responded Malcolm Reynolds.'Of course, Captain.'The sun had begun to set and the temperature had cooled to perfection. The crew stood out the back of the ship in silence. Staring into the empty bay of the empty ship. Kaylee had disabled it and it was n't going anywhere. Ever.'If you've got something to say, River. Now is the time. I do n't ever want to see any of you back here. Leave this valley in peace.''I'll do my best Captain.'River set a booted foot forwards and spoke.'You all know why we're here.'began River.'We're here because today we wish to honour the loss of something that truly belonged to us all and we all belonged with it. I am truly thankful for those days, the days that saw you all save me from hell simply because you felt you should. There are other people today who should be here to share this moment and without them, I am truly sad. This is goodbye from me. Goodbye and thank you.'Simon stepped forward,'I truly thought that this ship would outlive me, even as a doctor. It served as a safe haven for longer than I deserved to have it. Mal kept us safe when he had no reason other than sheer stubbornness. Because of him and this ship my life changed for the better. This is goodbye from me. Goodbye and thank you.'Time had changed Jayne for the worse. There was good money to be made running down the Alliance and it had cost him an arm and an eye. As if fate had n't been cruel enough, he'd gone completely bald.'Cap'n. You and I had never seen eye to eye. Did n't matter what. From girls to grenades, we disagreed. You kept me alive when I did n't deserve it and you gave me a bunk when you should've given me a bullet. You gave me this ship to call home and for that, I say thank you sir.'Kaylee took a step forward, in tears,'She was a good girl and you treated her right. Better than anything I ever could. You were honest and kind but firm. This ship meant that I could be happy in my life. I love you sweetie. Rest easy.'Inara had only become more graceful in her age. She had saved a dress, just for this moment. It was simple and elegant and nothing like the clothes she used to wear. When she said her words they came out as a mixture of anger and pain,'This. This is the worst ship any Companion could have been associated with. It was because of you that I chose it and I have n't regretted a day. It was my quirky, dirty, messy little hideaway from flawless civilisation. It was an honour to stay with you and until the day I die, I will love you for every moment.'Zoe stepped forward and spoke. Addressing her senior officer, but the words were far from standard issue.'I was with you from the start, sir. There was never any question. I was with you when you bought this ship in whatever madness overcame you. I was with you when you hired Wash, I was with you when you hired Kaylee and I was with you when you hired Jayne and when Simon and River came to us. I was there when you married a psychopath and I was there when you single-handedly broke the Alliance. I am here with Serenity when she finally gets the rest she is overdue. I am not with you now, sir. For that I apologise. You have gone where I can not follow for now and I will miss you. When you ca n't run anymore, you crawl and when you ca n't do that. You find someone to carry you. I can no longer carry. Here is where I leave. Until next we meet, sir. Goodbye.''That'll do nicely, River. Go home. Be safe.'The crew of the Serenity left then. Getting on Jayne or Inaras ship and left. Never to return, as requested by the captain. They left everything as they were ordered to. They left Serenity with its bay door open. In front of which they left a grave with a tombstone. The left a ship and a grave in Serenity valley and never returned. Upon it they hung a coat, a holster with a revolver in it. Upon that tombstone they left the only thing that could be said:'Here lies Malcolm Reynolds. Captain. Hero. Friend. He Never Let The Sky Be Taken From Him.'", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He thought to himself that breaking into a government facility in hopes to download illegal superpowers was n't the most logical decision he ever made. But reflecting on everything that has gone wrong in his life it definitely was n't his stupidest idea. Finally, he had reached the end of the hallway. He thought he might be lucky for once.

Invisibility would be lovely. Super speed could have many useful applications. His senses heighten. He could feel every atom in the air recklessly bouncing into one another.

He gathered every ounce of courage he could muster. He stood up and defiantly roared \" Here I am! \" The secret agent looked at him with cold eyes unnerving eyes and a playful smile that danced across his lips.

He opened his eyes and saw the bullet suspended in the air inches from him. He believed he finally he got lucky. He has more than just the power to feel the atoms but he can also control them.

Juliette takes a swig of vodka from a plastic bottle and offers it to you. You take a sip, these are new friends and you want to fit in, but this stuff tastes like piss and battery acid. Still, Juliette isn't the type of person to piss off.

Your teeth start to chatter. You hear a pounding noise in the distance. It's not a tree hitting a window, it's heavier, like hands against a wall. \" Hey guys, how much longer is this going to last? \" you ask. \" Rookie, don't be such a scared little bitch, okay? You're going to kill our vibe, \" says Samuel, \" You're only an understudy, we can replace you. \" The pounding is growing louder and closer.

Now the pounding is at the door, the handle shakes with the force, before the door gives way and reveals a bleeding woman in a tattered gown. The woman comes at you with her arms outstretched, her eyes are black and sunken. Everyone is screaming. You jump from your seat and past the woman, down the stairs and into the house. An hour from this moment, you will realize that one of your classmates was shouting at you, \" come back, it was a prank! \" but for now, your heart is pounding in your ears and you are practically falling down the first stair case. Perhaps you heard Juliette say \" Fuck'em \" or \" Forget about them. \" This damn house is a maze you think, but you've heard it's always best to follow the left wall. You can't remember where you heard that, but it's better than nothing. You twist through the house in the darkness, running your hand along the peeling wallpaper. Your escape ends when the floor disappears for only a foot. You know it is only a small hole because your chin hits the other side of the hole as you fall, snapping your head back and filling your mouth with blood as your teeth pierce into your tongue. You don't fall now, you slide, down the edges of a tight rocky chasm that grows tighter and tighter until you're stuck. The blackness of the house has been replaced by darkness like you've never known before. Your feet are trapped and your ankle feels broken. You grab your phone but it tells you that it has no signal. Next, you reach for the lighter in your pocket, flicking it on and waving it up – you can't even see the hole you fell through. Turning the lighter to the side, you see her. Abigail Hurst. She's only a skeleton now, her fingers are pressed against the edge of the chasm, there are deep scratch marks close to where her hands rest and the ends of her fingers look like they were sharpened down into fine, blade like points. You spit the blood from your mouth and scream but the rock seems to swallow the noise. You scream again, louder. Nobody comes. When it comes to human body, survival is a game of threes. It only takes three minutes without air to die, or three day without water, or three weeks without food.

Carter carries the mojito carefully to his father who is lounging on the front deck of the boat. His father nods and continues to read the latest issue of*Golf* magazine. Just then, Carter notices out in the distance another boat. He sprints to grab his father's binoculars. At the end of the magnified lens, Carter see's two girl's around his age aboard the boat. \" Dad! Dad! There is another boat!\" Carter yells in hope. \" OK my son, be back before sun down,\" the father responds not taking his attention off his magazine as he sips on the mojito. Carter dashes for the spare fishing/emergency boat, lowers it and boards. He reaches the other boat. \" Hi! I am Carter. I'm sure you ladies are hungry and thirsty.\" We have lots of supplies back on our boat.\" The ladies look exhausted and Carter looks way too excited. \" Sure,\" responds one of the girls. \" Yeah, thank god!\" responds the other. \" Cool, let's go.\" And the girls hop onto Carter's boat. \" So what are your names?\" Carter asks with a huge bit of eagerness. \" I am Michelle, and this is Shannon.\" \" Cool, so how old are you girls?\" Even more eagerness in his questioning. Michelle pauses before responding and says, \" Look we are just trying to survive right now, we really are n't in the mood to be getting hit on.\" Carter shuts up and continues back to his boat, staring away from the girls now. \" Besides Carter, we are both HIV positive.\" Michelle exclaims as they reach the other boat. \" Well, I guess that is OK.

She was chewing on some gum obnoxiously loud and when I sat down she gave me a once over, her eye lingering on my arm and eye, before she picked up a pen. \" Name?\" She said in a nasally voice, gum smacking. \" Trevo-\" I started, but she cut me off with practiced precision, \" Your Super name?\" \" Oh, right. Um. I'm called DullBozer.\" A blank stare for a moment, then she jotted my name down, \" And your power?\" \" Um... is there somewhere I can... uh, do it? Its a little crowded here.\" I said nervously, looking around. The women gave me that same blank stare, before sighing loudly. She leaned over her desk and pressed a button, speaking into a small radio looking object. \" We need an open space for a power presentation...\" She droned on, and the curtain behind her was pulled open by a harassed looking nurse. The gum lady, still chewing, nodded her head behind her. I stood up and walked past her into the clearing. I glanced at the nurse who nodded quickly, \" Show us what you can do then.\" I nodded in response. I flipped a panel on my robo arm and typed in a quick code. For a moment, nothing happened. The gum lady sat chewing loudly, looking bored and the harassed nurse was just staring at me. Then someone shouted as my baby descended. Gleaming metal. Spikes. Serrated steel. 12 Machine gun mounts. A double-full bore main cannon, and 3 sub cannons. 1 fully operated rail gun. 6 grenade launchers and a pair of twin flamethrowers. My baby stopped above us, blocking the sunlight and casting us into the shade. The hover treads were activated, sending everyone's hair flapping in the breeze. Gum lady, I noticed with a sense of pride, had stopped chewing her gum. \" And in addition to the weapondry, it has a fully stocked mini-fridge, Wi-Fi, Heated seated and-\" I snapped my fingers and a spinning blade popped out of the bottom of the dozer, \" -a lawnmower attachment.\" Smirking, I dismissed my machine with another code, sending it into the sky where it would enter sleep mode and hover there until I called for it. I sat back down with a smile, glad that I was finally getting some recognition. Gum lady smiled nervously at me. \" Well, you definitely pass. No need for any more questions, you've got what it takes.\" She said, handing me a pile of paper work and several small badges. \" You'll need to pin this to your shirt now.\" I did so, paying little attention as I peered through the curtain at the murmuring crowd. Happily gathering my new belongings, I thanked her before leaving. Everyone looked terrified. Phone girl was chattering away, a fearful eye on me. I could make out her conversation, as usual. \" OMG, that smelly guy is a horrible gross villain. So gross. He stood in front of me.\" Villain?! I scoffed. Just cause a guy looks scary does n't mean he's evil. After all, I'm an official hero now! I could n't wait to show off my pin and badges! I looked down at them with a smile.

{"input": "A pill gives you good luck the day you take it, but equally bad luck the next. The more you take, the more lucky/unlucky you become.", "output": "They use to think luck was just a myth, an irrational application of patterns onto random chaos. Well, they used to think a lot of things until I proved otherwise. That's right, not until \" Dr\" Henson proved luck could be manipulated, because he stole that from me. Just like he stole my unifying theory of physics, my proof that all light is a shade of pink, and my experimental warp drive results. That goddamn liar has always weaseled his way into my research, and always got RasTech to publish mere hours before I can. I'm just glad I figured out who in RasTech he was, kind of easy when you only let one other person into your luck pill secrets, and that I've been planning today for a long time. Because without years of thought, this would go horribly wrong. You'd have to be an idiot to think you could sneak into RasTech's headquarters, get past dozens of armed guards, make your way up seventeen floors and through five solid metal doors, and kill their vice-president without getting shot before you're past reception. But I'm feeling lucky today. Incredibly, scientifically lucky. I swallow the last set of pills, I can only take five an hour or I'll pass out and my day of luck will be wasted. I figure it'll take less than an hour, given my luck, so I started twenty three hours ago. And these things are exponential, so even I have no idea how lucky I'm going to be. Pistol loaded, good. I walk my way towards the front door, hoping the guards will forget to ask me for ID. Which, thankfully, they do. I walk through reception, trying not to catch anyone's eyes. Luck only goes so far, even this much. The lift doors open as I walk towards them, but no one gets out. I smirk, the chances of a company like RasTech having a computer glitch like that is really quite low, so things are looking good. Even so, I keep adjusting my collar as the lift ascends. My palms are getting sweaty, because I know they'll realise I should n't be here. And the lift does n't go up to the floor I need, RasTech decided they needed to have more security between madmen and their board. The lift jerks to a halt, and I wince. But, before panic can get much of a hold, the lift doors open. My guess is that RasTech security hit the wrong button when they realised they needed to stop the lift, and it just happened to be on a floor so it could open easily. Lucky me. I start running down the corridor. Ironically, this seems to be floor thirteen. But that's higher than I'd hoped for, so I'm not complaining. Just need to turn this corner to get to the- \" Hey, stop!\" calls a guard, his gun leveled at me, blocking the stairway. Well, I guess it's time to really test my luck. \" Your wife's been sleeping with Gary!\" I scream at him, which gets the response I'd hoped for. His resolve falters, he almost drops his gun. \" How, how the fuck would you know?\" he asks, gritting his teeth. \" Same way I know she's in that storage cupboard with him right now,\" I say motioning to a door just next to him. Eyeing me suspiciously, he opens the door to see what I'd just happened to guess he'd see. \" You fucker Gary!\" he shouts, turning his gun away from me and into the cupboard. I sprint past while he's distracted and start making my way up the stairs. You see, my gun's just a backup, lucky guesses are almost as powerful. The same charade happens on the next floor, this time resulting in a punch out between three guards who had all been backstabbing each other for a promotion. I get through the first security door with my eyes closed, poking in a random password. Damn, this feels good. Unfortunately, heh, an odd word to be using, y'know, because I'm so lucky, and, never mind. Fifteen armed guards are on the other side of the door, guns pointed straight at my chest, earmuffs protecting them from my wild guesses. But, I've got more out my sleeve. I'm confident RasTech ca n't outsmart me, given they've only been publishing my ideas for years. I run straight towards them, closing my eyes to avoid panic as they all fire their guns. I hear bullets slam into the wall behind me and half the guns jam as I jump over them, higher than I've ever jumped before, running towards the sound of a helicopter outside. I see an opportune window ahead, fire a bullet, and jump through. A few moments feeling wind rip through me clothes makes me doubt if I'm lucky enough for this, but then I land on the floor in the helicopter. The pilot looks at me, confused, but happens to get my intentions very quickly when I point my gun at him and gesture up. Okay, that one was n't really luck. But I'm enjoying myself here. As we fly up to the seventeenth floor I smile, I've been even luckier than I'd hoped. I spot the man I'm looking for through the nearest window, salute the pilot, close my eyes, and fire a bullet. Opening my eyes again I see him crumple to the ground, and a manic grin spreads across my face. The pilot looks terrified, but I bet he'll look more terrified when I jump out the helicopter. Yep, I was right. I open my arms wide as I plummet downwards, enjoying the cool breeze.

Another six, and I start losing coin flips. Twelve more, and I resign myself to my fate. At this point I know there's no way out, though I think it'd be quite funny if I was killed by a papercut or something. By chance the first person I met when I got out of bed was an officer assigned to hunting me down. I try to run, but sprain my ankle. The next twenty four hours is filled with an incredible number of people, myself included, trying to kill me. I was n't lucky enough to succeed in dying though, no matter how hard I tried. Okay, I'll admit it. I only tried to kill myself because I know how these pills work better than anyone, and I know how to trick them.

It was today, actually, in 1987. I walked down the dirty hallway, wincing as I kicked a needle aside with my nice leather shoe. There was the patter of rain audible outside, with the distant crack of thunder punctuating it from time to time. I reached the corner and turned, walking past the window towards the next hallway full of apartments. As I reached the very edge, a bolt of lightning shattered down through the sky, momentarily breaking my disguise for anyone who could see me, highlighting an absurd skeleton through a black outline of a suit, my top hat becoming a hood, my briefcase highlighting a scythe, and these fine silk threads becoming a coarse burlap robe, all with a glowing white skeleton somehow visible through the whole mess. Lightning flashes muddied glamours terribly. I would've been pretty annoyed, if the hallway was n't totally freaking empty. I continued down towards my destination, room 313. I did n't knock. I simply pushed the door open with my right hand. All the locks were immediately opened, as though they were unlocked to begin with. There, perpendicular to the door, was a soft arm chair, facing a crooked and cluttered coffee table. A lamp stood guard above the chair, but was off. There was a figure in the chair, silent, and still. Perhaps asleep? No matter. The window at the end of the room away from the door sounded like natures drum, a beautiful white noise to rest to.... and not so bad as a final swan song. I cleared my throat. The figure did not stir much at all, but I knew he was at least awake now. I pulled out my \" checklist\" really no bigger than a business card, with three golden lines next to them, each with a small gold box to the left side. \" Are you Francios Hall III?\" My voice, though silent to all but him and myself, echoed like the thunder outside in the tiny room. The figure did not move from it's rest, I assumed because he was paralyzed with fear. The first box was filled with a tiny green checkmark, and the name was rapidly etched in gold on the line, as though sketched with a pen. \" Were you born on the second of September, 1949?\" My voice again echoed like the boom noises outside in the distance. The figure again did not stir. \" I am here to collect your mortal soul. It is time.\" My voice boomed loudest. The figure mumbled something. I switched over to my human voice, a much more normal tone. \" I'm sorry, what did you say?\" \" You are mistaken. It is not my time.\" A feeling of annoyance came upon me, as this idiot obviously had no idea what he was talking about. \" Look, I know this is hard to deal with and all, but-\" I froze, my mouth half forming the words, as lightning flashed outside, highlighting the figure in the seat before me. In pure horror I stumbled a halfstep back as I began to hear the whispers of the eldritch horror in front of me, taunting me with languages dead for millenia. The door slowly creaked shut, and the bolt latched. I frantically looked down at the card, to see that neither the age nor the soul box had been checked, which was understandable considering the indescribable monstrosity that was resting inside of the body in front of me was certainly not a mortal soul. I wish I could describe what it was in front of me, with words like \" ancient\" and \" pure evil\" and \" monstrous abominations of time and space\", but even those do it no justice, not that it was bound by such simple concepts. And dear lord was it right. That fester of pure evil certainly had more time on this earth. It was n't even just one soul, but some sort of glob of some unknown number of the most purely hatred filled things in existence. It was like the fabric of the universe warping around one big old pile of fucked up shit. I was completely powerless against it in those short few moments. I waited, practically holding my breath, lungs or no lungs. And then it died. \" Now, it is time. I am ready.\" My briefcase snapped open, jerked up to my chest, and the thing jumped right in, before my case slammed shut violently. I walked outside, into the parking lot, got into my car, and sat there for a long 15 minutes, silently, thinking about what I just saw. I quit the next day. There was really nothing else I could do.

In the fridge, he found the milk and swished it around. It was empty. He thought about drinking water and growled softly in response. He picked through the empty cans and found one without a cigarette butt in it and drank the drizzle left. It was bitter and stale. The beer had been sitting open since last night. He was n't surprised. \" You coming back to bed?\" She called, twisting around so one of her naked breast could be seen. He glanced over at her and saw how the sheets hugged the curve and swell of her hip. He felt himself stiffen. He thought about it, but knew he could n't afford another go with her. He'd paid her all he had last night just to stay the night. He shook his head in answer to her question and walked away, pausing to look at himself in the mirror as he passed. The dirty tank top, spotted with food and drink, looked as bad as it smelled. The jeans he wore were stained above the knees and desperately in need of being washed. There was a sour smell the clung to him mixed with the smell of old onions. How the hooker he bought suffered his smell last night, he did n't know. He rolled his tongue across his teeth and blanched at the fuzzy feel of them and the metallic taste left over from last nights beer. \" You should think about forgiving yourself.\" She said, slipping from beneath the sheets. Her body was flush and pink and warm. Her breast bobbed softly as she bent to search for her panties beneath the bed. He knew she was just advertising for another round, but he was broke. She found them, hesitated and glanced back over her shoulder with a come-get-me look. He shook his head and turned out his pockets. She gave him a playful pout. \" I'm serious.\" She whispered. \" Forgive yourself.\" \" For what?\" He asked. \" For whatever made you the way you are. People do n't choose to live like this. They just forget why they love themselves.\" She told him, pulling on the dress she was wearing last night. She saw his head drop and him turn away.

She moaned, and it was n't all acting. He looked over her back into the mirror. \" I remember why I do n't love you.\" He whispered, beginning to pound away. He was talking to himself. He remembered a happier time, a laughing child, and a loving wife. He stared at the scar running from ear to chin and the bright white scar above his left eye. The mirror was shaking and the beer bottles on the dresser rattled as he pumped harder and harder. He remembered the laughter. He remembered his friend's jokes. He remembered the drive. \" Easy, baby.\" The whore called, losing her grip on the dresser and sprawling face first into the mirror. He pumped harder yet, causing her to cry out. He remembered driving them home. He remember the beer flowing from the mouth of the bottle. He remembered the lights of the tractor trailer. The whore slipped sideways into the mound of dirty clothes on the floor. He followed her down, pressing her naked body against the floor while sinking himself again and again into her. \" Stop it.\" She growled, rocking forward with each thrust. She realized this was a mistake. He kept pumping unable to hear her. His hands grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. He remembered the crash and nothing for a long while. When he came to though, firefighters were pulling his daughters mangled body from the wreck. He was pressed face to face with his wife and watched her gasp and die for nearly twenty minutes. He was lucid enough to watch it happen. The whore was pushing back and pumping her hips. She just wanted this to end and the fastest way was to bring him to climax. He did. He gave one final thrust and roared with anger as that last memory flashed. He held himself deep inside the woman under him and once he began to shrivel, he pulled away. \" Dammit!\" She growled, climbing to her feet. \" I thought you needed a friend.\" She slapped him. He took it. She slapped him again, and he caught her wrist and shoved her back against the dresser. He saw himself in the mirror behind her. \" Pay me.\" She demanded. \" If you're going to treat me like a whore, then pay me like one.\" She slapped him with her other hand. He kept staring into the mirror. \" I remember why I do n't love you.\" He whispered, seeing the scars. She thought he was talking to her. A bottle had broken during the sex. She grabbed the broken bottle by the neck and punched him in the stomach with it. He looked down at the bottle sticking out of stomach in surprise then watched her stab him a couple more times. \" I'm a hooker. I do it for money. You pay enough, and I'll let you humilate me. You do n't get to humiliate me for free.\" She told him, the scowl on her face changing her into something ugly. \" I'm. Still. A. Person.\" She screamed, shoving the bottle into his neck. He did n't resist. He just slipped to his knees before the dresser as if it were an altar and the beer bottles were candles. \" I remember why I do n't love you.\" He whispered, with blood on his lips. He reached up and touched his scars. He turned to the woman who'd stabbed him. \" Thank you,\" was all he said. She was confused, the anger fading. She dressed quickly just then realizing what she had done, and fled. He slumped over sideways and died, feeling relieved.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The stone beneath felt oddly soft as I tenderly brushed away the vines obscuring it. The rock bore a strange marking upon it, one that has been bored into my mind since that day; a series of circles, crosses, and lines too oddly shaped to describe well. I called my colleagues to the spot and we began an excavation. For weeks, we labored in the mountain summer. Gentle scraping and tentative digging masked the impatience welling up within us all. I felt the anxiety more keenly than most. The symbol dug at my psyche as I dug at its resting place. When I slept, I felt it upon my brow. When I worked, it rested upon my back. Never speaking, merely prodding, encouraging. It was the ruin of a hermetic shrine. There were no markings aside from the symbol to denote its affiliation, nor was there any trace of human life. The architecture was primal. The columns seemed to have formed naturally within the Earth, and had merely waited for someone to remove the encasing dirt. When the ruin was clear of debris, the symbol had begun to lean upon me. It pushed me to consider the strangeness of the ruin, to pry its secrets. There are many who would have simply lacked the interest to do so, but not I. This was why I lived, and the symbol knew. I sat within, long after the others had gone to sleep. The moonlight illuminated the edges of the pit dug around the temple. The air had a weight to it, as though there was more about than usual. I breathed it slowly and nearly choked on the smell of sulfur. When my coughing fit subsided I looked upon the shrine again. There stood a man… No, there stood a symbol, with many faces, holding a great tome in his hand. No words were needed. We both knew that I had no power here, that I stood unprotected in the presence of a being far beyond my understanding. I saw another glimmer at the edge of my vision. The shrine's perfectly circular stone floor shone with the moon's light. A summoning circle, though the tales suggest it is better to be outside of one rather than in. The not-man reached out and touched my mind. I experienced the thoughts of a thousand men, the secret love of a ten-thousand elopers, and a Name. Dantalion. I awoke far away on the shores of some unknown coast. I did not wonder where. It was not given to me to wonder. I was claimed, possessed. These hands, which once belonged to an archaeologist, now smoothed stone with their blood. They shaped a new shrine to do honor to their new master. When they had finished, when the body which was once mine had finally paid recompense, I was freed. He is not an unmerciful god. He had sated my dream. I had pried out more secrets than I could ever have desired. I laid down upon the soft stone floor, and felt my body consumed. Now, I was the secret to be pried.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Jessy shambled out of the ladies'room, still a little bit drunk. She flung her arms around Arthur's neck, hushing \" Hey there, stud.\" In his ear. Only then did she see J's corpse. Just as the rest, she was n't suprised or even scared. Everyone knew J was gon na die rather sooner than later, and everyone had mentally prepared themselves to see a corpse the next day they went to work. Only no one knew it would be the morning following the office party. \" You think we should... you know... call an ambulance?\" Peter from accounting asked, still in his undershirt. A black eye decorated his face, from when Paula had punched him the night before. \" I do n't think an ambulance would do him any good now.\" Selma from HR chimed in, followed by a \" Rather a hearse.\" from Edna from the same department. On the far side of the office, a door smashed open, causing everyone to cringe and hold their ears at the loud noise. Out came stumbling Richard Tether, CEO of Tether industries, both of his arms put around his wife and the young latino guy that worked in engineering, Ricardo, respectively. All three were grinning. \" What'sthecommotionofthisss?\" Mr. Tether bellowed, causing another collective cringe and ear-grabbing. \" Uh, Mr. Tether, Sir...\" Jessy mumbled and pointed towards the dead Jebedaiah. \" Oh crud!\" Tether cursed loudly, causing a third cringe. A few people of the group were splitting from the group, cautiously heading for their own desks, searching for water, coffee or some quite place to nap. \" Insurance is going to kill me for this!\" \" Honeeey...\" Mrs. Tether grinned. \" Let's go back to your office and have another... *performance review* with Ricardo!\" Both her and Ricardo giggled after she said the words. Without waiting for a response, both led a confused Tether back to his office, paying J's corpse no mind. The CEO of Tether industries tried to object, but as the realisation dawned on his face, it lit up and he sped up his pace even more. The rest of the crowd had used the commotion to quietly escape responsibility. That only left Arthur, Jessy and a very dead Jebedaiah. \" Damn cowards...\" Jessy mumbled as she dialed the emergeny number. Arthur was left alone with J as she explained the situation. He never knew J that well, but he did n't dislike or even hate him, either. But now, Arthur felt a little bit guilty, because the prominent thought in his head was: \" Damn, J.

Most of it simply little more than propaganda dolled up a bit. I have to fight back a sneer as I pass them, as the cameras are always watching. In my pocket clink the richest treasures I have ever held. Inside the small, metal cylinders I try desperately to keep quiet resides the last remaining hope for all of humanity. At least that's what I tell myself. In truth, so far as modern society is concerned, I might as well be carrying a pound of methamphetamine. I finally approach the dark alleyway my journey has led me to. I crank up the light amplification of my highly illegal cyber-eyes, and check to make sure no one is present. Only the steam that slowly rises, dancing in the chilly breeze, from a grate in the street before me. I smile again, with more feeling this time. Once again, against the odds, I've made it. Below my feet thousands of people live as humans once did, without the oppressive weight of plutocrats weighing down on them, condemning everything that makes us human. Even dreams. In my pocket the cylinders clink together again, despite my best efforts at silencing them. I really should invest in a proper carrying system and stop putting the damned things in my pocket. A pocket full of dreams, how poetic. My amplified vision catches a small movement near the grate and I tense. Probably only a rat, or some other small animal looking for a meal, but I focus in anyway. Through the steam a thin red beam glimmers to life, and I know right away there is a dot tracking across my forehead. End of the line. They finally found me. In my last act of defiance, and the main reason I never did invest in a better carrying system, I toss the cylinders, the dreams, towards the grate. If they found me here, it is very likely they are already down below, but I have to try. They clink and clatter as they hit the grate, some of them falling through and into the steam below. My final thought before the bullet carves my brain from my skull is that I hope one dream in particular made it down. It involves a beautiful young woman singing in the most beautiful voice.

Tell his story.", "output": "With a loud thud, Julia landed on her back, with her eyes closed and her light-brown pompadour perfectly combed. She had exited the shower back at home, at 10 a.m. on January 10, 1972. Thankfully, she had just enough time to put on her long-sleeved bright orange button shirt ( with a light tan ascot underneath ), and a purple skirt. Her clothes did n't matter much to her, as she believed her cooking was what drew in audiences to watch her popular television cooking series titled The French Chef, featuring Julia Child. She neglected to wear any make-up most of the time, but was consistently berated and annoyed to do so her producers. This is because her major sponsor was the Polaroid Corporation. Julia lay on a cobblestone walkway for a short while. She opened her eyes and believed herself to be in some sort of waking dream. There were many elves standing around her, with their long microscopes, which looked like telescopes widening and elongating to study Julia's movements. Her fingers moved upwards to touch the fanciful instruments, only to have them constrict away from her out of embarrassment. \" Must be... magic,\" she whispered. Slowly, she stood up and brushed dirt off of her skirt and shoulders. The elves continued to be entranced with what they considered a lovely figure. In this land, Julia Child was not simply a popular television chef; she was an idol. Her bare feet moved gently across the grey cobblestone, while the elves encased her in a sort of crowd-bubble. Together, they watched her and imitated every move she made. Their curiosity was mistaken as scorn when Julia began to glare at each of them, but made no attempt to converse. She looked around the elves and found a strange land had distinctly emerged as she viewed it. Smiling, she became a symbol of pride because she felt her mind had conjured a fantastical place to visit during restful hours. \" Great Child,\" the elves sang, in high-pitched unison, \" we beseech thee - to help - overcome the great famine.\" Julia spun around many times, watching the elves'mouths intimate their plea for worthy support. \" Help?\" she questioned, in a low voice. \" Concoct, for us, a variety of meals to aid in our quests,\" said a single elf directly in front of Julia. The brave elf had climbed atop two other elves in order to meet Julia's eye level. \" Then you may return home!\" She cleared her throat. \" To cook only?\" and viewed uniform nods in a gentle rhythm from each of the elves surrounding her. \" Not much choice, so I guess I'll do it. After all, it's only a dream.\" The elves did not hear her say it was a dream because they had begun celebration and jumped up to laugh and dance. Each of them skipped in a straight line down a narrow dirt path and waved for Julia to follow. She tried her best to enjoy her supposed dream world as much as she possibly could, while it lasted. As the elves led her, Julia turned around and then back again and found herself at the bottom of a large, pink mountain. The dandy monstrosity seemed to resemble the same cotton candy she had eaten two nights ago, at a local fair. A cave at the bottom of the mountain opened up, showcasing a chewy rainbow center with elves decorating the inside. Julia ran in with them and the cave closed behind her. She felt it strange she did n't feel fear; only a surging willingness to complete her goal, and return home. Everything she could have ever needed to cook was already prepped and ready for her, waiting in a small kitchen circa 1972. There were knives, forks, salad forks, steak knives, licorice straws, toffee spoons, omelette pans, souffle pans, non-stick pans, imaginary pans, hairy pans, and everything in-between. Julia cracked her kneck and knuckles, looked directly ahead of her and said, \" Welcome to the French Chef, I'm Julia Chi-\" \" Oh no no, your salutations wo n't be necessary, Great Child,\" explained an elf who appeared on her shoulder. \" Please continue.\" Julia was shocked, but overjoyed. She began cooking an enormous preparation of food, which included dishes from all over the world. Her memory kicked in and unloaded recipes from years before she even knew what cooking was, when her friends and family began trying to teach her how to prepare a meal. She was very quick with her movements and wished she were this fast back at home. She chose specific ingredients, such as the O.J. gallon of pure strength, black muffins of clarity, giant celery stick of seeing, and the rare fruity yogurt of deliberation. After a short time passed, Julia was finished. She had not made any mistakes, and completed her task with enthusiasm because she was ahead of schedule. The elves took the meals she made and stuffed them in their large backpacks of enormous storage and +5 fortitude. The backpacks were put in a large hot-air balloon to be carried to the candy cane castle to feed the young elves who had become sick with the fruitcake plague, because no one likes fruitcake. Julia watched the elves and decided to sit on a small, red elf chair to rest. She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Maybe it's been weeks, I can never remember the bunny to human years conversation. Well anyway, it started long ago. An infectious disease started killing the humans and bringing them back as zombies. The virus did n't seem to harm us animals, well not physically anyway. A lot more humans did start hunting and eating us though, so there was that. I was only a young bunny when the infection spread, but I've grown into a fine adult rabbit now, if I do say so myself. As I grew so did the number of dead slumps. That's what we called them, mostly as an insult, but because of the way they slumped over as they walked. They sure did have horrible posture. Maybe it was due to their foot flesh rotting more and more as time went by. The humans never really noticed, but the feet were a weak spot for them. I tried to tell them many times, and how did they repay me? They tried to kill and eat me. Life has been hard, between the dodging slumps and avoiding humans. I've gotten by pretty well though. My legs are as lean and muscular as an athletes. It's funny how I have n't seen any athlete survivors. It mostly appears to be unlikely people that survive. I saw an elderly woman, a small child, lots of women, oh and some back woods hill person. They sure were a lively bunch. The screaming hill man attracted the slumps with his mating calls though, got them all killed. I've got me one of those rabbit itches. You know the ones, where I stop and use my tiny little paws and constantly rub at my nose. That's actually my allergies to the flaking slump skin. So you'd think food was on the better side of life, but really it's not. Most of the grass is covered in that horrid flaking skin I mentioned. Not to mention all the extra pee the humans dump everywhere. And they call \" us\" the animals? Sheesh. I always knew humans were n't the smartest though. I mean, they were the ones that caused the virus in the first place. I'm just glad I was n't in one of the labs where they tested on animals when they chose to test that virus. I wonder if out there somewhere a zombie bunny is wreaking havoc. I've thought about becoming a raging zombie hunting bunny myself. Though, I never had much motive. Staying shacked up in my bunny hole with the wife is so much better. I have many children, some have died due to zombie related accidents. Even so, I can always make more babies. It's not like those humans have even earned it. Honestly, I'd be okay with humans being wiped off of the planet. The slumps will eventually rot away too, I think. Just yesterday morning I heard the crows squawking about the south seeing some breaks without zombies. Of course, smart creatures like myself, we know they are migrating. Kind of opposite to birds. Birds go south to avoid freezing to death. Well zombies go north to avoid rotting to death. Extra death? Dead beyond dead. To avoid melting away their rotting flesh. It's basic math really. Perhaps I should try to make the journey south, live it up on the beach. I'm an old rabbit now, a journey like that would take thirty generations of my family to make it there. There's no way those brute humans would let me hitch a ride. Even if they did, my wife and fifty-seven kids are all here. I could n't leave now, not after everything I've endured. All the slumps I've watched get ripped apart. All the humans I've watched get ripped apart. Yup, those were the good times. Yes sir, this old bunny has seen, has done, enough.

My worst suspicions began to take shape. Could it possibly be..? I reached out a hand - dusty and dry, scales peeling off at the edges - and, ever so gently, ever so slightly, I eased the branches of the bush apart to get a good look. My eyes were painfully teared up even still, and I could only barely make out the shape. It was dark, nearly black, but that could merely have been the evening sun blinding me. The shape had the wrong proportions. Its chest was too big. Its arms were too long. Its head and legs were far too small to be a half-blood like me. It had to be a pure one.

Enough reasons to kick me out from my tribe when I began showing hints of the hybrid I was. I never forgave my momma for that. Moving the branch had alerted him ( it was a him, right? The bristled head indicated so ), or maybe it was my quaking terror, but the outcome was the same. He whipped his head around and called out, voice booming. \" Who goes there?\" I did not answer. He advanced three steps; his face lit up as he saw me; I barely had time to cry out before his fingers had closed around my arm and he yanked me out of the bush. \" I... I'm really sorry, I-\" \" Who are you? What are you doing there? You were spying on me, were n't you?\" I squeaked out a negative and tried hard to run but my arm was still caught. His grip was too tight, and his skin was so dry and it chafed and I wanted to go home. \" Puny pathetic little wimp of a thing. You're a half-breed, right?\" \" Y-yes.

I watched him until he was nearing the horizon and my eyes could not stand the dust any more. Then I got up and sprinted away in the opposite direction. Back to the river. I needed to get back to the river. Blood was oozing through the cracks in my scales and I needed to wash it out before it dried in there. A line of sparkling blue, spanned by my lengthening shadow. I dived; first up, then down into the waters. The dust washed away, carrying with it a red cloud. My cuts stung but it was a good sting, a clean sting. I surfaced for air and looked around.

In the predawn gloom I silently cast off my sheets and donned my father's old coat, wrapping my body tightly in the warm cotton and leather material. Silently, I made my way next door, and prodded my younger brother. Slowly, he came to his senses and looked out of his window. You couldn't see it from here, but we both knew it was the right time. He dressed in cold weather clothing, and I, with some effort, pulled open his window and climbed out onto the roof. The corrugated iron bent and banged under my weight, but held. It always did. I hoisted my brother up after me, surprised at his weight. He had grown a lot in the past few months, though still only reaching just below my shoulders. *Still a child*. Finding our footing, we turned around to face it. The large moon was a barely perceptible ring, circled by a blinding halo of white light. Behind it loomed the gargantuan figure of the gas giant Coeus, taking up the majority of the dark blue sky of the planet Erimos. My brother gasped in astonishment, reminding me suddenly that this was indeed his first time seeing the eclipse. Mind you, I was not much older than him when I first saw it, all those years ago. Had I felt the picture painted on his face, back then? Astonishment, awe, fear? It had been so long… \" It's beautiful. \" My brother whispered aside me, still standing helplessly, his neck craned back as far as it could go. I followed suit. Looking up at such a huge figure always gave me a little vertigo, like I was about to be sucked up, and tumble outwards into the dark sky high above. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the other children of the planet Erimos were already atop their roofs, their figures still and sombre. The only sound to be heard was the gentle, ever present noise of the dust-heavy wind, a gentle breeze travelling eternally across the flat and desolate planet. God, the silence. I had forgotten what it sounded like. Finally, after what may have been hours, my brother spoke. \" Is that where mother and father are? \" He pointed upwards, likely referencing the precipice of the halo around the moon. \" Is that where they are fighting? \" I shook my head, and his hand fell back to his side and he was silent for a while. Then he spoke again. \" Why do we stand up here when there's an eclipse? \" \" It's a tradition. \" \" Why is it a tradition? \" I chuckled gently. \" Nobody remembers. I imagine if anyone knew the answer to that, no one would keep on doing it. \" \" You mean there's no point to it? \" \" Of course there's a point. We just don't know what it is. \" Again, there was a brief moment of silence. I could see that the top of the halo was beginning to dim more and more. The eclipse was starting to fade. \" Maybe we stand up here to remember the war. \" My brother noted. Again, I shook my head. \" We've been doing this for hundreds of years. Countless generations. *The Escorting of the Eclipse*, remember? \" My brother turned to look at me. There were dark rings under his eyes, brought out by his pale face and dirty blond hair. \" Exactly. \" He said. And just like that, the eclipse was gone. The halo disappeared altogether, and the sun appeared. The world once more illuminated, and high above the tell-tale signs of battleships specked the pristine blue skies. It wasn't long before the distant thundering of gunfire began again. I cast another look at my brother as we made our way back down the gentle slope of the roof and through the window, and reconsidered my previous thought. Maybe he's no longer just a child.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Whether it was the hair rising on the backs of their necks, or the sticky sensation of the cool wind disappearing on that humid night, the three friends knew that something was... wrong with The Man who stepped out from behind The Tree. They stopped in their tracks, or rather their trail, for that is what they were on. This camping trip, suggested by The Strongest, was the last hurrah of senior year, a *denouement* of childhood. The Smartest had immediately agreed to this venture, as nature was her \" passion.\" The Bravest, who at this moment was feeling his courage slowly seep into the thick air, said yes too. So when The Man took a step towards them from The Tree, His Tree, the three friends instinctively drew together. It was not a cognizant motion, but rather a primordial one, an instinct buried deep within their subconsciouses. The Strongest stepped in front, his normal bravado dampened but not completely extinguished. The man had stopped not five yards away from the trio, underneath the shade of another tree. The Strongest opened his mouth to speak, and The Man immediately tilted his head, as if listening. It was a subtle motion, yet all three friends gasped in pain. The Stongest fell to his knees as his strength left him. He knelt there, shivering and buzzing like a live wire, his left hand clenching, unclenching, clenching. The Smartest dropped straight to the ground. Her brain struggled to process the static that filled her neurons. Black and white fuzz coursed through her nervous system, and her eyes saw only snow. Only The Bravest was left standing. He tried not to look at The Strongest, because he knew he would fall. He tried not to look at The Smartest, because he knew he would be struck dumb. All he could do was look at The Man, and be filled with black, deep horror. The Man stared back and began to walk towards The Bravest, whose tears and sweat amplified the weak moonlight that lined his pale face. As The Man crawled forward and passed through The Trees, The Bravest tried to comprehend the being that drew near to him. It was a dark thing, and that was all he could think of, all that his mind could grasp in this state. The word *dark* bounced around his head like a desperate bat, trapped inside a cage it can not see. DarkdarkDARKdarkdarkdark. The Man reached The Bravest, reached out to The Bravest, and stroked his face with two cool fingers. \" My. Child.\" The thing spoke, but The Bravest saw no mouth. The words resonated in his head, replacing the *dark* with their twisting, fluttering, skittering repetitions. mychildmychildmychildmychildmychild. The Man took the hand of The Bravest and led him away from the others, towards The Tree. The Bravest found that he had no will to resist, no desire to flee, though the hand that held his was rife with decay and infused with pestilence. The Man stopped at The Tree, and released the hand of The Bravest, turning to walk away. The Bravest began to feel his senses return, his thoughts reorganized, and the absurdity of the situation became clear to him. He gathered his breath to shout at the obviously deranged man who had terrorized his friends, when The Man froze in his tracks. The Man did not \" turn\" so much as twist, with a wooden creak, to regard The Bravest with his face. For that is what The Bravest now saw, the face of The Man. The milky, pupiless eyes somehow smiled mockingly as The Man raised a single finger to his lips. He shushed the screams that were rising, roaring, exploding from the throat of The Bravest as he felt the branches of The Tree slowly reach out, and a silent blanket of darkness covered the forest once again.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Go easy on me guys. **My Three Faces** I wake up from my post-lunch nap at work to find that I overslept. But thankfully just by ten minutes. I look up to see my boss standing next to me with an annoyed look. She says, \" I hope you got your beauty sleep, we have work to do\". I stand up and follow her to a meeting room. I hated what was going to happen next. We had to fire the junior programmer in my team. My boss starts off by asking a pointless question to the poor guy. \" Are you aware of why we're here?\" \" I'm getting fired are n't I? Please give me one more chance! I promise I'll do better.\" I reply, \" I'm sorry dude. We have already given you two months and additional training. This wo n't work out. I suggest you find a job in a different field. Programming is not for you. You really do n't understand computer logic.\" My boss intervenes as usual, \" I think what he means to say is that you are finding it difficult to cope with the demands of our workplace. Your skill sets are not aligning with that of our organization. We hope you will do well in your future.\" After another gruelling ten minutes, all three of us walked out of the room and the poor guy who got fired was being led to the HR desk for completing the exit process. After a brief silence my boss says, \" You should put a filter on that mouth of yours! How do you think he felt when you told him he should switch careers? That's not a decision we should be making for him!\" \" I DO feel sorry for the guy. I just told him what I thought. He really should n't continue in this field. He might be better off doing something else.\" \" Well it certainly did n't look like you felt bad for him.\" \" Why are you talking like you owe him something? It was after all, an exit interview. \", I said a little confused. \" He was already devastated by what you said. I just wanted to bring down the tension in that room.\" \" I'm sorry.

I close the door and my daughter comes running up to me. I ask her how kindergarten was and she asks me a question. \" Daddy, my teacher says that Santa will come with toys to all the children who have been good. Is that true?\" \" Santa is not real sweety. He is just a made-up person. I'm the one who brings you the toys! \", i say playfully. But somehow her face saddened. Just that moment my wife comes out of the kitchen to do some damage control. She says, \" What daddy means is, some people believe that Santa is real. And maybe he is. Just because you ca n't see air, does n't mean it is n't there right?\" I say \" But... That's not what I...\" She breaks me off and says, \" Why do n't you finish your coloring while Daddy and me finish cooking?\" My daughter smiled her million dollar smile and said, \" Ok Mommy.\" We go into the kitchen and I start chopping fruits for the salad. My wife says, \" Honey, I know it is difficult for you to be polite. But at least for our daughter's sake try not to say anything that might hurt her.\" \" We have had this conversation so many times! I really do n't know what to do about this. We have been together for 8 years now. Have you seen me being any different?\" I ask, a little frustrated. \" Let's not talk about this now. I do n't want our baby to hear us arguing.\" I feel thankful that I have a habit of not speaking while eating food. It makes for lesser painful interactions. We finish dinner and my wife takes our daughter to her room to put her to sleep. I do the dishes and go to our bedroom. I needed to take a shower. Something that would wash away the frustration. After the shower I look at myself in the bathroom mirror and think to myself. The Japanese say you have three faces. The first face, you show to the world.

He had been slow on that snowy day and he was rewarded with an arrow through his chest. The rider drew nearer. The sun was at his back. That was something Kara did not care for. She preferred to see her marks face. She pressed her body against the tree and counted. One. The horse's hooves made small, splashing noises in the shallow stream. Two. There was the faint sound of coins jingling against each other. Kara rubbed her hand on her shirt to dry off any moisture. Three. The horse moved past her and she leapt onto its back behind the rider. She put her sword on the rider's throat and pulled the dagger from his belt. \" Make a noise and you die, \" she said. She pushed the sword towards his throat to emphasize her point. \" Where's your gold? \" \" My gold is yours, little girl, but my life is not. \" His voice was deep with a hint of laughter in it. Kara smacked him on the side of the head. \" Shut up and give me the gold and you can be on your way. \" The man reached towards his side. \" Slowly, \" she warned. He lifted his cloak and gestured towards a purse. She grabbed at it and yanked it free of his belt. She checked her surroundings quickly and moved to jump off of the horse. The man's hand slammed down on her thigh and squeezed. It felt as if her thigh was in a vice and it was still tightening. She realized she would have to kill this man. There would be no other way. One of them would have to die in the fading light of day. \" Let go or I will cut your throat, \" she said. Her voice strained from the agony in her leg. \" My gold is yours but my life is my own. \" His elbow caught her on the chin and she was falling. Her vision went dark for a moment then she slammed into the ground. She almost lost consciousness but she fought it. That would mean death. She tried to stand but her legs betrayed her. A jagged rock sent pain through her back. She cried out and rolled away. The man was off of his horse and standing above her. She had somehow kept a grip on her sword and she weakly lifted it in his direction. He easily swatted it away. \" Do not fight, little girl. To fight is to die. \" He lifted off the ground one handed as if she were a bundle of rags. She saw his face for the first time. It was scarred and wrinkled with a hint of a smile. He stood her up and steadied her when her legs betrayed her. His eyes were white and sightless yet they followed her every movement. \" My gold is yours, little girl, but your life is now mine. \" Panic spread through her body. Fear gave her strength and she kicked at him. He smiled and threw her hard to the ground. His hands moved in a strange pattern and light glinted from the edges of his eyes. \" You will learn or you will die, little girl. \" Her body was lifted in the air but the man was two paces away. She opened her mouth to scream, but there was no sound. \" My gold is yours, as is my food and water, but your life is mine own until you learn to take it back. \" She was laid on the back of the horse. She tried to fight against the force that was holding her but it was no use. The man got back into the saddle and patted the horse's shoulder. \" You may call me Solomon, but that is not my name.

You pale in comparison to some of the stronger mages that I used to know. Your powers just do n't cut it.\" All of them looked shocked. So shocked that the steady streams of power stopped. I looked down, and seeing that their attacks had torn my clothes beyond all saving, I made a simple gesture, and the cloth regenerated. Something that not many people could do, and it was n't even my main power. \" Even if we're not strong enough individually, we should still be damaging you with our combined attacks.\" I favoured the one who said that with a condescending look. \" I meant as a collective. As a group, you do n't even outrank any of the top ten. It's quite pathetic really.\" This prompted another attack from all of them, this one at full power. \" Haha, I actually *felt* that one! But, the statement still stands.\" \" HOW? HOW? We were told that we were probably as powerful as Merlin himself!\" I laughed. I laughed a lot. And I laughed hard. By the time I was finished, there were tears in the corner of my eyes. \" As powerful as Merlin?\" I wiped the tears away joyfully. \" I have n't heard something so funny in *decades*. Merlin was the single most powerful mage of all time, and he stood head and shoulders above the mages of his time, who stand head and shoulders above the mages of today. He could do everything that you could do, and more. He was a fighter, a healer, and a seer, and he was the best at all of them. And you think that you're on his level. Ha.\" \" How can you be sure? How do you know how powerful Merlin was?\" \" Well, you see, that's simple. I'm his twin brother. The one that they do n't write about. The one person, of all time who could hold him back.\" \" Oh yeah, well say we believe that, say that you actually are Merlin's brother. How could you hold him back?\" I arched an eyebrow. \" Do n't you understand? I've been sitting here, taking the combined force of all of your attacks, and I do n't have a single scratch on me. My body ca n't be damaged. Even Merlin could n't permanently damage me. I have the single worst power of all time. Ever. Immortality. Oh, and a clothes beam too.\" I demonstrated by repairing the damage they had done to my new clothes with their attack. \" Worst. Powers. Ever. Of all time.\" \" Why do you say those are the worst powers?\" \" It's simple. Do you know what immortality is?\" \" Yeah, you live forever.\" \" No. To borrow a line, immortality is n't living forever. It's everyone else dying. Understand why I sought you out now?\" They nodded dumbly. \" Well, if it's any consolation, you're clearly powerful by today's standards. I'll let you live, just in case your descendants turn out to be strong enough to off me, and also because you made me laugh like I have n't laughed in decades.\" \" Wait, you're just leaving? Just like that? Why?\" \" Kid, if you get as old as I have, you can do things arbitrarily, just like I do. Reasoning is for the young, and those that still have a purpose in life.

All the videos, theories emerge from that one tiny group employed by NASA. The reason was to distract public attention from something much sinister", "output": "The Inspector General's department had sent Krakowski and Manahan on short notice to Charlottesville, Virginia. Research projects for the space program- with the promised decade of the Rice Stadium speech already passed- were being funded at unparalleled rates. But an inexplicable trace of outside money to NACA-related projects had added to a growing puzzle. Why the organization had been replaced with the new NASA was still up for debate in some circles. In file folders they found photographs of Apollo lander mockups on back lots in California. The visit to Kellen Aerodyne in St. Louis had dug up three prototypes of an unusual but apparently government sanctioned space capsule. All were labeled Columbia 3. One had already been dropped from a tower crane and appeared destroyed beyond all repair. The Inspector General had one question for his two agents: was there actually proof that the Apollo missions, too, had been faked? By the time they arrived, Doctor A. A. Heidrich, naturalized American citizen, of the Department of Physics was sprawled on the floor of his upstairs office at Edward Pendleton University. The flask of whisky on his desk had been tipped over and long ago flooded the floorboards under him. He lay, arms raised and seeming to point at an autographed photo of Werner Van Braun. While Manahan ran and fell to his knees at the doctor's side, Krakowski began to poke around the papers that had been pulled from the file cabinet, itself tipped on its side. \" Who did this?\" Whether it was poison, blunt force trauma, or some other method he did not particularly care. \" Ich sah ihre Gesichter nicht, ich sah nur ihre Seelen,\" the Doctor muttered. \" Tell us everything. Quickly!\" said the government man, waving a badge before his eyes. It could not have enlightened the German even if he had seen it. \" There is one group. They have a name, I do not know it, but I know they are codenamed Tunnel Light. I never thought they would betray me. But seeing how many others they took- I should not have been surprised.\" Krakowski gave him a penetrating look. \" They killed Kennedy because the conflict had to resolve their way. And they will kill Randall because it advances their lie. Die schmerzen!\" he suddenly exclaimed, falling back to the floor. \" Write that name down,\" a disbelieving Krakowski told Manahan, who complied. \" So the landing was not a hoax? If not, what was the purpose of the deception?\" \" Niemals, certainly not. There is something much larger here.\" He motioned to a liquor-soaked paper a few paced from his head. The AA paper. Krakowski had n't been to college; his classroom was the streets of New York when being a cop had made him a citizen with standing. The Federal government picked him up after he got out of the MP corps in 1945. His humble education was no detriment. The Second World War, the paper began read, had resulted in a leap for military progress, bypassing decades of research and development. Great conflict was the driver of progress. Today, the United States in particular faced a challenge from the Soviet Union that was primarily technological. In many aspect, we were losing. It was necessary for another technological leap- one which would place America so far ahead of its adversaries that they had no chance of coming back. The solution, it said, was a \" theoretical war.\" One fought against an adversary so advanced humanity had little hope. Extraterrestrials. If we had no alternative to annihilation by creatures that were not of our own, what boundaries might be set on the destructive power we created? And who would try to stop us? The thought tingled his spine. NASA had done it. If we believed that our government did not possess the know-how to make it to the moon, the public would never suspect them when they saw the arrival of the planet's enemies for themselves. Not for themselves, but for the greater strategic goals of a machine that would have made Eisenhower roll in his grave. There was a group out there- Tunnel Light, had he called them? - who were willing to kill to make sure the story stuck. Who were they? NASA? Agency men? Perhaps both. He tried to compose himself. \" This is interesting stuff,\" he said, turning to Heidrich. \" You mean to tell me they're actually doing it?\" The Doctor in turn grabbed Krakowski's arm, a death grip, pulling him closer. He panted for breath. \" Es tut mir leid für alles. Do not believe the lie of the prime numbers.\" And he closed his eyes. Whether the Doctor lived to see the hospital, or passed away in the ambulance, they never knew. To Manahan it scarcely seemed to matter. \" He's a Nazi freak,\" he said as they walked away from the building, touching their hats whenever a police officer recognized them. \" Who knows what's gotten into his system. If you ask me, it's all a sham. Someone wants start a civil war inside Defense and blame it on the troll under the bridge. They got a washed up college professor as the fall guy.\" \" You know how serious that is?\" asked Krakowski, deep in thought. The launch of the Air Force's first manned rocket was met with fanfare as Colonel Randall Showmaker climbed into the Columbia 3 capsule. After leaving orbit, his transmissions were garbled. A mysterious particle wave knocked out power. The crushed remains were later recovered from the Yukon Territory, covered in what generals described as a toxic sludge.

I reached out and touched his forehead. Dotted with cold sweat. He stirred, his eyes jerking half-open at the contact. \" Who's there?\" *Just me. And you. You at last. * \" Who is, who, who is touching me,\" he gasped and tried to lift his hand to his face. Dizzy now. Bile rose in his throat. Coughing, fighting it, he tried to raise himself from the seat, but his shoulders were too heavy, still strapped in the seat, and his mind was thick. *It's only me again. I'm here with you, my love. Do n't fear, it's your time now. Come with me. * It had been fifty years since I first saw him. Fifty years of watching and loving. \" No, no, I need to get back to the front, I head the mortars, they're firing on us,\" he muttered weakly. His hand patted uselessly at his pocket, reaching for a phone. It was crushed, he felt through the cloth. The only cars that ever drove this long road would not be here till morning. His heartbeat rose, more blood spilling against his collar. *It's time to go. I'm here for you. Mount up, it's time to ride. * \" It ai n't that cold, I ca n't be hallucinating.\" *You can let go now. * \" Let go, hell, I'm just waiting till morning, we'll be fine, someone will stop by.

I have to wire in. The captain is wondering where I am. I'm not AWOL, that's not me, I'm fine, need to drive back and talk to the medic is all...\" his voice trembled, rambled, panicked. \" What's that plane I hear?

I interfered with a few bullets once, and I got in a bit of trouble for that. Ice is beyond my reckoning.

Did I meet you during the War?\" *Something like that, yes. * \" Ah well, if we're old friends, let's go.\" He surrendered himself to my grasp, and I delighted in his soul.

{"input": "You are going to be fine. You come from a long line of lunatics.", "output": "\" You are going to be fine. You come from a long line of lunatics.\" Andy kept repeating this to himself. He stared at the little bits of teeth stuck in the wall next to the bullet hole. He thought about how they had formed full teeth in the mouth of the man that had called him a lunatic only minutes before and how he felt a kind of regret that he had n't let him keep them. Not a guilt, per se, but almost a feeling of loss. And then, as he thought about the man's face just before he shot, he realized that he had appreciated the man's fear. Reflecting on the man's eyes specifically filled him with sense of pride. It was n't that lunatic offended Andy, but rather that it held proof of a truly great standing in the world. These were certified killers, all of them, and they were terrified of him. All of these \" made men\" as they liked to be called had pulled the trigger enough times to probably be called psychopaths themselves. Yet here they were, thinking that he was the lunatic. His father, cousins, uncles and everyone on the next few branches of the family tree above them were appreciated for their aptitude for violence. This had always made him wonder whether he was living up to his family's reputation. And in those little pieces of teeth he saw that he had. He had been called \" insane\" and a \" psychopath\" but had never liked these as he felt they sounded very clinical and official. But lunatic - Andy liked lunatic. While it had made him very angry at first, he had certainly come around. It came to him that not only was he undoubtedly a lunatic but that this was most likely a running trait in the family. He thought about his grandfather who was known for suspending \" debtors\" and tying weights to their toenails, slowly removing them. He thought about his grandfather before him, who had in large part earned the family name its weight when he had some men quarter his own brother for a drunken pass made at his wife. He thought about his father, who told these stories to Andy while showing him how to properly butcher and dispose of a body. And this is what he missed in that man - validation. However, it comforted him to know that not only were there many more terrified faces left in the bookie's but that surely some would make it out and help spread the story to his family. Besides, if he had n't killed the man for calling him a lunatic, he would n't have been living up to the title very well. He smiled about this to himself as he pulled the hammer back and thought, \" You are going to be fine. You come from a long line of lunatics.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

This story's little girl has more teeth! *Shit. She recognizes me. * I tensed as the woman's attention on me sharpened. She was shorter than average, with close-cropped black hair spiked up like a hedgehog. Her title was Havok, I remembered her from the news. Heightened agility and an ability to generate small, fierce explosions of telekinetic force at close range. Havok had honed her powers into an impressively deadly skill-set. She was a smart, tough, cunning villain, and she knew I could take her apart in seconds. Havok was scared, and she started calling for backup. \" Hey. HEY! It's Nightmare! Thundra, Cavalry, get over here! It's fucking Nightmare!\" Thundra, a tall and slender woman with abilities that granted her limited superstrength and invincibility, and Cavalry - a cloner whose clones got tougher the longer he focused on creating them, as I recalled - rushed over. Thundra was dressed in unremarkable street clothes, never bothering to hide her identity. Cavalry, in contrast, was dressed in matte-black body armor and held a gun. *Shit. His clones will be armed too. * \" Are you serious? That's actually Nightmare?\" \" I did n't realize he'd stuck around after retiring. Local PeaceForce must have cut a deal. Thundra, I'm almost ready to go, you and Havok go lock him down... wait, what's with the girl?\" *No. * \" He had a wife, remember? Must be his kid. That'll make this easy.\" *No no nononono... * Thundra strode over confidently. Her face was empty of the usual collection of lines and marks that were the first layer of identity - a blank mask of remote, Slavic beauty. \" Nightmare. Bad timing, I guess. Is this your girl?\" Beside me, Alexandria stirred fretfully, but stayed quiet as I squeezed her hand - fast-fast slow - in our safety signal. She'd been so good until now, calmly accompanying me on our errands and enjoying the sunshine. She liked being with me during weekend days, and Cassandra pushed me to keep her out of the house as much as possible. Did n't want her getting too pale. In a brief moment of detached reflection, a part of me chuckled at how little my little Alexandria's future suitors would care about her tan lines once they realized the extent of her abilities. The beast within me rose to Thundra's unspoken challenge. I was pushing forty but my beast and I were still as strong as ever. Tundra, tall even among men, hardly came up to my chin. I could feel my skin going numb as the chitin formed beneath, and my vision was already growing sharp. Of course I could take them. I could take on half the damn PeaceForce if I wanted to. Only Fulcrum or Bygone or one of the other heavy hitters could really harm me once I was in top form... but Alexandria was a different matter. My beast and I worked together. We were siblings, symbiotes. Alexandria's monster was of another breed entirely, and very hard to handle, even for me. I am a monster, but my little girl is going to grow up to be a force of nature. It was time to act. \" Thundra, Havok, back off,\" I said, stepping in front of Alexandria. \" I do n't care what you do with the money, but we're staying out of it. Clear?\" Havok shook her head. \" No way, Nightmare. Score's too rich to take chances with a wild card. You know the drill: girl goes with me to the center of the room, you go to the wall and wait, we're out in 15 minutes.\" The dumb little shit looked at Thundra and nodded towards my little girl, and the blond thug nodded back. Cavalry was off to one side, mumbling to himself, gathering his power. I knew if I let him take too much time, his clones would be strong enough to hem me in unless I was willing to cut loose... and that was n't an option. Thundra strode forward, intent on Alexandria, and I snarled at her. Black, spiky plates of iridescent chitin were rippling over my skin, though I kept my face clear for now. \" Back OFF, Thundra. You know you ca n't stop me.\" Alexandria stirred. \" Daddy, what's going on? These people sound mean.\" I risked a glanced down and saw her eyes - so bright and blue, like Cassandra's - slowly darkening. Just like mine do when I'm using my power. *Damnit, I'm running out of time* \" It's fine, baby. Just some nice people stopping by to say hi, that's all. Rest easy, ok?\" I kept my voice light, but I let my beast rise. Alexandria's little brow furrowed, and her eyes kept getting darker. My little girl just did n't buy it when her old man started pulling wool over her eyes. If she did n't calm down, this was going to get bad. Thundra grinned. \" That's right, girlie. Your daddy needs to go talk with my friends, so you and I are going to take a little walk, ok?\" I groaned inwardly as Alexandria lifted her head. \" No. You're a stranger. Go away.\" \" Young lady,\" Thundra replied, \" you should learn to respect your elders.\" She favored me with a mocking smile. \" What's the matter, Nightmare? Do n't like to spank your kids? I'll do it for you this time, I'm happy to be the bad guy.\" Alexandria's dark, dark eyes locked on Thundra, and something awful burst into the air between them. \" Go AWAY!\" She screamed, and it sounded like a crowd of people shrieking along with her. The thing she summoned, a vaguely human-shaped column of smoke and tentacles over ten feet tall, craned towards the stunned villain with a wavering cry that sounded like it came from the depths of hell. Thundra shouted in surprise and her skin suddenly shone with a brilliant light, her fists raising to fight. \" No, you idiot!\" I roared as my beast surged, \" run away! She'll go through you!\" Thundra ignored me, and my daughter's summoned monstrosity enveloped her and tore the woman apart in a shower of blood. Alexandria, eyes utterly black, held tightly to my hand as her head swept around to lock on Havok. The eldritch monstrosity surged forward and the dark-haired villain shrieked. Cavalry shouted a challenge, and I turned my head in time to see a small crowd of men with rock-hard skin being charged by a vaguely dog-shaped beast with too many jaws and blades for legs. Cavalry's shout turned to screams as I snatched up my daughter and leapt for the exit. Cassandra and I had yet to understand the nature of our daughter's ability. There was an irony to it, though, that sometimes kept me up at night: I had been called Nightmare for a long time, but my little Alexandria could make her nightmares reality.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Each time I immediately take my headphones off and set them aside, wondering what to do, knowing that I have six hours before the plane is caught in a freak electrical storm over the Pacific an hour out of Sydney, throwing critical systems and all external instruments out of whack and resulting in the plane making an unexpected detour to deadville. I've tried talking my way into the cockpit, fighting my way into the cockpit, talking to the flight attendants, tampering with the bathroom equipment, hell, I'd even tried seducing the younger and more attractive of the flight attendants, but just because I knew we were both going to die did n't mean she did. Ironic, I think. Sydney was supposed to *be* paradise, especially for someone like me: cheap grad schooling, good public transportation, a jamming music scene, and an expansion market for good internet and good video games with good music, everything a techie musician could possibly want. And yet I'm stuck in the closest thing to hell I think anybody has ever experienced, because now not only am I on a doomed plane for possibly all eternity, endlessly reliving the last six hours of its life, every time it resets I wake up once again listening to that *fucking* song. You see, as it turns out, when I die, time resets by six hours, or possibly to anytime between six and about seven and a half hours before—I was n't really keeping track but I think that's how long my nap was. I only just found this out, or I'd have probably figured something out by now. I shut off the music and check the time. Right on the dot, I have 5:59:46 to go before my seemingly inevitable demise, and a fresh lack of ideas for how to spend it. Spend it... hm. I do n't know why I did n't think of that before. Of course. Southwest has onboard wifi, for a price, and they take PayPal. Did n't seem right, somehow, to be paying through the nose for this shit, especially now that it was basically the equivalent of having to install a DLC to finish a game.

By ten I'm going to be halfway up Mount Sill.\" \" By ten I'm going to be dead unless you help me, all right?\" Even in hushed tones, my conversation is beginning to draw some looks. \" I... What?\" That got his attention. \" Listen. In six hours, this plane will get caught in a freak electrical storm over the Coral Sea. You got that? Unless we avoid it, by diverting to New Caledonia, or Fiji, or... fuck it, we can detour to fucking Papua New Guinea for all I care, just as long as we get out of the air.\" I was n't a natural whiz at geography or anything, I was just looking at Google Maps.

Merrill slowly paced towards the conveniently mounted cedar bat, and gripped it with both hands, with gratuitous gesture -- for dramatic effect. The lone, naked alien menacingly glared on before turning its back to this clear display of aggressive behaviour. Merrill took the opportunity to deliver a powerful blow to the spinal column of the fully exposed invader, while none of the characters acknowledged the rapidly mounting plot-holes. With a final strike, Merrill sent the nude intruder tumbling into the cabinet, where a fortuitously placed glass of water exposed the Aliens'one weakness; their complete and utter lack of foresight. The water spilled onto the alien's right shoulder, where -- are you ready for this? -- it fucking dissolved through its skin. Fucking *water* -- the ubiquitous requisite for the existence of all single- and multi-cellular life -- dissolved through the dermal cells of this creature. That's right. Evidently, water ( pH 7 ) is as corrosive to these fuckers as sulfuric acid would be to you if you poured it directly into your eyeballs. \" Holy shit\" the alien must've thought. \" Why did we decide to invade a planet that is 70 % engulfed in this stuff?

Unfortunately, the missile missed its target and struck a nearby hospital. \" Has the target been neutralized,\" came a voice over the radio. \" Negative, General.

It's just like real life, you just cut it open, stick it in and sew it shut again. It's easy, man. Trust me.\" He took my silence as a sign of doubt. \" Look man, it's either this way, or not at all. When have I ever lied to you?\" I could have named several occasions, just the last week, but I could not deny that Harold was my only chance of getting the new *iMplant*. Someone at Pear Inc. probably thought himself a genius for coming up with such a clever name, but in reality it just sounded stupid. Despite the name, the device itself was not stupid at all. It basically gave a Wifi and Bluetooth connection to your brain, complete with a dumbed down OS and interface, controlled by thought. Combined with other Pear products ( like the *iSpine* an exosceleton, that was connected to your spine, or the *i*, a little camera inside one of your pupils ), the *iMplant* was part of a project called *human 1.1*, that was only made legal, because it had been declared weapon technology and thus was protected by the second amendement. This however meant, that anyone who was part of the *humans 1.1* project was technically armed at all times and could not enter many public buildings, because they were unable to put away their weapon and Pear Inc. was required to provide the government with a list of all their customers. This had sparked a wave of illegal black market sales, so it had n't been too difficult to get my hands on an *iMplant*. Getting it in my head was the real problem and Harold claimed he could do it. Because i could n't think of any other way, I agreed and let Harold drive me to his parents house, where he lead me to his basement. He had set up a little armchair for me to sit in, while he gave me the sedative, then the world faded away, as Harold got to work. I awoke to what I suppose it must be like, when someone sticks a knife halfway through your brain and wiggled it around a little bit. There was red veil in front of my eyes and I could n't see. Every single cell in my brain screamed *alarm* and my ears were ringing. I tried to scream away the pain, but the feeling in my throat told me, that i had tried that before. \" Harold?\" I whispered and a thousand and one voices in my head cried out. I tried again, a bit louder, but only the voices answered, screaming and crying and filling my head with pain, so much pain. Something had gone wrong. I could feel it. Then I felt something different. The voices in my head, adjusted, came together and formed one single voice, that did not belong to me. It was a high pitched cry, that implied pain, greater even then what I was feeling. It sounded how I imagined the souls in hell would sound and it sounded like Harold. Harolds voice grew louder and louder still, but now something strange was happening. the pain in my head, was slowly going away and gave place to a feeling of joy, that can only be felt, when something terrible is ending. My head cleared up, the ringing in my ears faded away and the red vaild before my eyes was slowly lifted. They revealed Harold, on his knees, in front of me, producing the sound that filled my head and that had made my pain go away. His mouth stood open, much wider then any human mouth was meant to open and his eyes had rolled back in his head. His hands clawed at his face, leaving bloody scratched behind and he had torn on his mouth so hard, that he had ripped his own cheeks open. Skin was hanging from his face in huge patches and he was in the process of ripping one of his eyes out of it's socket, but before he could proceed, his neck snapped and his lifeless body hit the floor with a soft *thump*. I know I should have been shocked, I should have screamed, but the joy and satsfaction his final cry of demise had created inside my had was simply overwhelming, so I just sat in my chair and stared at Harolds dead body, his twisted neck and the pool of blood that was slowly forming around him. Now that my head has cleared up a little I have allowed myself the question of what exactly happened to Harold. His voice still echoes in my mind. Faintly, but it is still there, more than just a mere memory. It is as if I absorbed some part of Harold, before he killed himself, or maybe that was the reason why he did it. I would love to think about this for a bit, take some time to analyze Harolds death, but I feel a faint ringing in my ears, some red patches in the corner of my eye and a feeling in the back of my head, as if someone is about to stick a knife in my brain and wiggle it around a little bit.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Of which I am about to enter.\" Barack Hussein Obama let out a tiny gasp as the world suddenly collapsed into a single point. Gone was the stage which he had stood on, his feet seemed to be simultaneously firmly on the ground yet floating in mid air. His wife and children were no where to be seen. He looked up from his feet and saw nothing but white, he was n't in a room, there were no floors or walls. He looked where the crowd had been seated, hundreds, thousands of people were no longer there. A small sigh of relief escaped as he turned around and saw two familiar faces. \" Bill...... George....... I am so glad I am not alone.......... How did this happen?....... We need....... To get help.\" \" Barack, or should I say Mr. president? We do n't need help. We are on our way to where we need to be.\" Bill Clinton put a hand on the shoulder of the current president of the United States of America. \" On our way? Ca n't you see that there is nothing.... Around us? \" Barack gestured to the emptiness. \" Why does he talk so weird, he's even weirder than the last one.\" \" Fuck you ted. And Barack, seriously do you have to...... Pause...... so much? \" George W. Bush scowled towards the bespectacled man standing behind the President. Barack's eyes widened as he turned towards the bespectacled man, and the 39 men other men alongside him. \" Watch your mouth! You curse in front of this audience? And me your father? I raised you better than that!\" Snickers arose from the crowd as the 41st president chastised his son. Barack let out a deep breath of relief. \" I'm dreaming, of course. Everything is OK, I'm just dreaming.\" Clinton put his hand on the shoulder of the 44th President, \" No Barry, you're not dreaming.\" \" ENOUGH\" The crowd fell quiet after the first syllable and parted to let the source of the booming voice through. \" I will not allow such childlike and disrespectful behavior to take place. You *will* address this man as Mr. President. He has taken the oath, he stands among us, he holds the office.\" The President abandoned any hope that this was a dream. The man standing before him could not be a figment of his imagination. Somehow he was in the presence of George Washington. There was no denying the confidence and leadership that ebbed from this man. \" Mr. President, allow me to apologize for my successors. They tend to forget the gravity and prestige of this moment. Tradition and custom require that I begin and lead the ceremony. But in light of your... Circumstances, I must cede this honor to another. President Obama, there is someone that is quite eager to meet you.\" The President followed the gaze of His Excellency, towards a bearded gentleman in a top hat. \" Abe, this is your moment sir\" \" Thank you George.\" President Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States of America, looked into the watery eyes of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, the man who had outlawed slavery. He had paid the highest price for his actions, actions that allowed Barack Obama, a black man to rise to the highest office of a country that had once thrived on the slavery of his race. \" Barack\" Abraham Lincoln returned the President's Gaze \" Excuse me, Mr. President. When W informed me his successor would be a black man, I thought it was another one of his silly jokes. I did not expect our country to be able to put aside its prejudices so quickly.I thought it would take more time. I certainly did not expect them to do so during a time of war with a collapsing economy.\" The 16th president paused. \" The night I was shot, President Washington was the first to comfort me. You see, as I will explain soon, those of us that are dead, we still yearn for our loved once. I missed my family. I was angry for being robbed of a future with them. Washington said to me on that day that I had paid a small price for doing what my country needed. That my actions strengthened the future of our country. That freeing the slaves would allow the United States to grow. I often doubted him. Yet as the Bush's and Bill have told us, our country needs saving. They found their savior in a black man. That..\" Abraham Lincoln held back tears as his voice cracked \" makes it all worth it\". 43 of the most powerful men in history grew quiet. 43 inspirational figures in history, men who had given legendary speeches that had moved nations and led wars, were speechless. The newest member of the group uttered the only two words that he could, \" Thank you\". Abraham Lincoln smiled and spoke, \" Now, it is time to begin.\" His voice boomed as he found his strength. \" Barack Hussein Obama, you have taken the Oath. You are now the President of the greatest nation in the history of the world. A responsibility so massive, that it requires the knowledge of every man that has held this office before you. I, the 16th president of the United States of America, am honored to place at your disposal, the knowledge, wisdom, and talents of your predecessors. **President Barack Hussein Obama**, please complete your oath and allow our strength to guide you through your presidency.\" President Barack Hussein Obama now understood.

The room was empty but she took solace in the corner, her head hidden between her knees. She looked like a sculpture, still and silent, sheathed in a thick, constrictive material. \" This is the girl.\" our guide said. My sister looked at our guide. \" Is she sedated?\" The guide nodded and walked towards the bed, a deceivingly simple structure that was built into the floor. The guide ran her hands across the smooth surface of the bed and tapped it twice. *\" This bed is located in Level 10 of Rotterdam Institute and is currently hosted by Project 4444. The patient has its neural network programmed to attack and kill, therefore it is constantly sedated and shackled. * *Please key in administrative password to access further information\" * The guide made a series of motions on the surface of the bed, ending with a small click. *\" Welcome.

It's best if you went into the Fourth State and wait for us there.\" \" Would you need anything else?\" the guide asked. We shook our heads in unison; it was hard to break the habit of living the life of a twin. They left and once the door closed, the room settled into a deep silence. I walked towards her and sat on the floor, straight in front of her, willing my body to be unmoving and silent. My body surrendered to my mind and soon, my astral body was released. Almost instantaneously, it tensed. I forced my physical self to exude peace and calm; I needed my astral self to be very strong for what was going to happen. She picked up a soft, high-pitched laugh, almost singsong-like. \" The girl is here.\" The laugh slowly grew louder and a new shadow started forming in the room, limbs moving hypnotically. Her body was blurred but her movements was sharp and clean. Then, she stopped and a scream erupted through the room. I felt Mara's presence the next second, her astral projection hovering beside mine. \"... so much for staying in the Fourth State,\" I thought. She did n't respond to my humour and focused entirely on the still, dark shadow now resembling the colour of tar, stuck in front of the girl. The scream stopped, returning us to silence. \" You like my welcome song, Maya?\" my mother spoke. \" I had been waiting for you, Special Forces Counsellor Maya.... ha-ha-haha-ha. It has been too long, my sweet girl.\" Mara's presence held mine gently, whispering *\" She can not feel me. \" * \" They have finally become tired of me... oh, they want me gone.\" my mother sang, her shadow dancing around our physical bodies. \" They want me go-ooone...\" \" I'm not here to get rid of you.\" I said. My mother laughed shrilly and stood, facing my body. \" Oh, how could I forget. Your sister's here too. A family reunion!\" \" She never let me close to her, that one... Mara.\" my mother whispered. \" She... she ha-aaa-aaa-ted me.\" \" I'm leaving.\" Mara whispered and I felt my being tense. The shadow became still and started circling the perimeters of the room. \" She's here, is n't she. She's here. She's here... she's going to take me away. Maya, Maya, tell me where is she. Where is she? Save me Maya, tell me where is she?\" my mother screamed, demented. I felt Mara's presence weaken and shy away. \" She is not going to hurt you.\" I replied. \" She is demented. She killed my love, your father. She killed my firstborn, your brother. She almost killed me, if I had not escaped.\" my mother screamed. She danced chaotically and started screaming again, fevered and high-pitched. I willed my projection to enter my body; the room succumbed into darkness. Soon, light emitted from all objects with energy, shimmering microscopic fireflies. The slumped girl's body shimmered and her head lifted; it was a sheath of flesh, bare of any facial resemblances. The screaming abated. I gently rearranged the light around her, encouraging them into patterns that best suited their levels of energy. Shadows soon appeared and disappeared, painting short bursts of vivid pictures. A man appeared; tall, dark, and vivacious. His movement stilled the room. A faceless girl appeared beside him, soft where he was hard, light where he was dark, still where he sparkled. Mara trembled. Soon, three smaller figures followed. A boy in his resemblance and two girls. They crouched on the floor, their backs facing the ceiling. \" Choose one.\" the man spoke. The woman stood erect, her body clinging to his arm. \" Destruction, death, or darkness?\" he asked sweetly, a finger on her chin. \" Please.\" the woman said. \" I had to spare their life, she was a mother too.\" Immediately, her body stiffened unnaturally and she stood on the tips of her toes, like a ballet dancer. \" I do not care, Macy. You defied my orders, you defied my love. Now, I'll take away something *you* love. Something that *I* gave to *you*.\" he whispered, his voice cloyingly sweet. \" Destruction, Death, or Darkness?\" The young boy struggled and stood bowed. \" Do n't split the girls.\" \" Well done, my firstborn. Picking up, where your mother slacks... as usual.\" the man crooned. \" Unfortunately, you are far too important for me. Leave..\" The boy's back straightened and he took three steps back, watching his parents. \" Your son has made it easier for you, Macy. Now, your choice is whittled to two: Death or Darkness?\" The faceless girl scanned the face of the man she clung to. \" I choose D-\" The entire ceiling caved in before she could finish the sentence, and crashed onto the five. Darkness surrounded the entirety. The lights rearranged themselves to reveal the faceless girl alone in the rubble, clutching the lifeless bodies of the boy and the man. \" He made the choice for you.\" I whispered. The scene played again and the shadow watched intently, her hands gently caressing the boy's face as he stood watching. \" He could n't have killed.\" she whispered, almost a question. \" He could n't kill. That's why he had to die.\" I said. I felt Mara tremble but we both knew that we were too young to have changed the events of the time. Neither of us were as powerful or as trained. \" He's on the Final State.\" I continued. \" Mara will accompany you there to talk to him.\" The shadow stilled and kept watching the scene replay over and over. \"... and the love..., my love...?\" the shadow questioned. \" He is perished.\" I replied. \" He was too broken to be whole.\" The shadow nodded, almost hypnotised. Mara appeared beside me and took my hand, catching the attention of the shadow. \" Whenever you're ready, I'll bring you there. He knows about this meeting; he's expecting you.\" Mara said. The shadow nodded and sat beside the girl's form. \" I can bring you back, if you're willing to return. It will be your choice, entirely.\" Mara whispered. \" We have time.\" Hours passed in silence before the shadow stood and acknowledge her readiness. Mara stood and went to her, whispering something. The shadow nodded once again and went to the corner of the room. I watched Mara quizzically as she came to me. \" I'm not sure how this will turn out, Maya. I never told you but... there can be exchanges made; Samhara can return.\" \" Mara, no. We have come to terms with this.\" I said frantically. \" I have spoken to them and now her. We will speak more, Maya. You and I, we have lived and we are older. You must understand...\" she strained, at the end. I nodded. \" I will need time but I know.\" Mara smiled and turned, walking towards the shadow in the corner. \"'Till we meet again.\" They disappeared and the light returned to the room, everything motionless. I stood and left, searching for Mara's body. She sat crouched, outside, her body barely holding any life. I held her hand, a hand I knew better than mine, and waited. Two shadows shimmered in front and a figure slowly started materialising, but it was not Macy. He stood tall, dark, and sturdy... Mara stirred and slowly faced me, her eyes welling. \" She finally made her choice.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Finally the silent moment passed when Batman cleared his throat to break the silence. \" Doctor you know who we are, and suffice to say we have picked you to help us.

{"input": "Countless years ago, you were granted a wish of immortality. You now contemplate your cursed existence as you become witness the end of the universe.", "output": "Bill was beyond vast. Adam stared at the supermassive black hole stretched before him as he floated through space: or more accurately, he stared at the total darkness that blocked out the remaining stars behind it. Where once the edges had been easier to distinguish, now there weren't enough objects orbiting it to get an accurate sense of where it cut off. Most of the remaining matter was already inside Bill's event horizon. A few million years ago, at his best guess anyway, there was a lot of to see. Probably the worst part of all this was not wishing for eyes that could comprehend things beyond the visible spectrum. All those colorful pictures of space he'd seen on the Internet were colorized: representations of radiation and electromagnetic fields that simply seemed like nothing to him. Occasionally a field or force would make his skin prickle, or cause his clothes to flutter like had caught a faint breeze… back before they had rotted away. That was a long time ago. He forgot what clothes felt like. He forgot what air felt like. It all came down to poor planning. He could have prepared better, maybe. Spent more time on his spaceship, planned his course better. Even thinking back though, Adam wasn't sure he could have built something strong enough to withstand the forces at play on that scale. The first problem, of course, was when the Earth died. Humanity was long gone, having played itself out in a nuclear war then limping along for a few millennia, never achieving the same level of technology they'd had before obliterating their cities. Adam wasn't interested in helping them, especially once it became clear global communication was off the table. China had detonated debris bombs in orbit, making satellites all but useless. Adam amassed what resources he could find, killed anyone or anything annoying enough to try and make a real play to stop him, then launched himself on a path out of the solar system. That's as far as the plan went at the time: escape the slow descent into the Sun, and see what lay beyond. Solar cells kept the lights on, literally, in his little ship, as well as powered his computer. That lasted a while, as did his backups, but within a few thousand years all his tech had burned itself out. Much longer than his clothes, now a dust heap in one corner of the ship. Things just didn't last as long as he did: he could fix a broken keyboard, or solder a lead. But he was wearing down the plastics, the metal. Then fans were cracking, the ball bearings rusting or warping. Nothing could scale up to match his needs, at least, not anything he could find to bring with him. So he watched the stars, and went a bit mad. He did a fly-by on a handful of near-Earth planets with no luck, but by then it didn't interest him much to find more life. He'd seen how humanity ended, and Adam generally came to assume any species he found would eventually die out and he'd be forced to find a way off another planet, this time without the benefit of understanding what he was doing as well. No, better to stay in the ship, and do the best he could to not crash into anything that he might get stuck on for eternity. That part proved difficult, but luck was on his side. Keeping wide orbits on larger systems meant avoiding a lot of smaller debris, but also left him far enough from the real gravitational'heavy hitters'that he'd have more trouble escaping. That was good for a few million years, give or take. By then, the ship was well and truly useless, and he was floating in a planetoid coffin. Adam wasn't sure of much by then. His mind wasn't meant to handle these kinds of stresses, he literally wasn't built for it. If any observers had remained, he'd have been considered completely mad. At some point, he decided to leave the ship. It felt too confining, and there was nowhere to go anyway. He pushed off the craft and watched it drift away, floating aimlessly in the deep space between galaxies. He didn't know when he was pulled in to another galaxy, but gradually he became aware he was circling something. That might have been the end of it, had that galaxy not collided with another. The result was truly magnificent: Adam felt like he watched it forever, an amazing complex display of force and majesty. The resulting shock blew him back out of orbit, and he drifted for a while longer… perhaps a billion years? He didn't know. Again, he was picked up by a galaxy, and this is where it would end, he thought. It took at least another billion years, but eventually he'd spun into the accretion disk at the center of a supermassive black hole. The heat, radiation, everything that would obliterate a normal body to particulate matter rolled off him like a cool mist. Maintaining his density was proving a problem, though: he was descending into the event horizon faster than the things around him, faster than expected. He must have picked up momentum from some gravitational phenomenon he didn't understand, because after whipping around the accretion layer for \" a while \" ( time was becoming a silly notion ), he felt himself pulling back from the black hole a bit. This bobbing continued, on and on, his inability to disintegrate somehow keeping him buoyed on the force of all the matter that did. The stars began to wink out: some may have simply accelerated beyond the speed of light relative to him, but definitely not all. Most burned their fuel and went dark. Neutron stars were fascinating, when they passed close enough for Adam to see. And it was difficult to tell a black dwarf from a planetoid as they were swallowed by the black hole. That was when he named it Bill. I mean, what else do you call something like that? He was done being clever, or witty, or sane. So Bill it was. Sometimes Adam talked to Bill, when he remembered how to talk. Bill would never answer back though, he just kept eating. Bill was hungry, he munched on everything in sight. Adam knew he'd fall within the event horizon soon, and then things would get a lot less interesting. No more light meant not a lot to see anymore. Suddenly, Adam felt an odd tug, right in his chest. A tenseness, a pressure, not quite painful but definitely not pleasant. He couldn't feel pain anymore, not really, but there was definitely something new acting on him. Was he inside the black hole? He tried to turn, to look back out, see if anything was visible anymore… when he saw it. Something glowing, moving, writhing below him. It wasn't there before, this churn of \" something \" at Bill's core. He had to be inside the event horizon, that's all it could be. But what was it…? No sooner did he think it than it was upon him: he descended with incalculable speed into the center of that churning mass, all the mass of the universe condensed into this ball. The tug became unbearable, a pain Adam couldn't understand. He was immortal! He was invincible! How could he feel this?! It was tearing him apart! There was light, it was so bright. After what had been almost entirely pitch blackness for so long, this much light was unbearable. Adam closed his eyes, but it wasn't enough. He felt as if his retinas were searing, blazing. How could he feel pain? It didn't make sense. Then, just as suddenly, the pressure and light were gone. Adam blinked his eyes open to find the world alive again, a million million broken pieces of Bill spinning off, forming new planets, stars, galaxies, all speeding away from him. Adam understood: he was too dense. His descent into the black hole couldn't be altered because of the magic used to make him this way… and he had triggered another Big Bang. But now, he was stuck, the center of a new universe that would one day come back to him, and no way out to generate the force needed to repeat his happy accident. Adam watched his creations speed away, wondering how many billions of years until they returned. He missed Bill. That guy was at least fun to talk to.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I had rides like this before. Maybe he just broke up with his girlfriend or lost his job. I was n't going to ask, he probably just wanted to get away. \" Rough day, Pal?\" He was just blankly staring at me in the rearview mirror and then glanced at a shiny pocket watch connected to the inner of his coat. He reminded me of a 1920's gangster. \" Yeah. We've all had those days. Women. Work. Tomorrows a new day though huh?\" I was n't getting anywhere. He seemed like he had to be somewhere but he did n't tell me to take him anywhere. I took him to central park since it was about a 30 minute drive which racked up the bill pretty nice. \" Here good?\" I asked. \" You tell me.\" I knew I should n't have picked him up.

It had taken him many years to reach the peak, and he saw no Kingdom of Gods - only a massive expanse of mountain. A plateau of pointlessness. He stood there, breathing deeply, impossibly alone. Had he embarked on this quest for nothing? Were there truly no gods - like the wise man had said? Was this all for naught? Thunder boomed, the light flashing across the sky. In an instant, he knew - He was here. \" **WHY DO YOU SUMMON ME, MORTAL? **\" the voice echoed, as mountains shook. His ears felt as if they would burst, and his heart would stop. But he would not turn back now. \" You have bedded my lover, Zeus!\" the man replied, blood dripping from his ears, \" You have defiled that which was sacred!\" His words drifted into the landscape, finding no purchase. Silence followed, louder than words. Then, the voice spoke: \"... **You're going to need to be more specific, little man. **\" The voice was softer this time, yet dripping in discontent. He felt his anger grow anew. \" *You dare mock me? *\" the man shouted, screaming at his creator. What kind of God did this? Would allow this? \" Three years ago to this day I found her, Zeus! No doubt her child - *your child* - would have been a healthy toddler; had she given birth!\" The ensuing silence felt heavy, oppressive. Then laughter started, and grew, until the entire valley shook in it, revelled in it. Clouds parted, and Zeus himself came down to face him, his face twisted in laughter, his body muscle and sinew. \" **How could she even be pregnant, **\" the voice replied, laughing in great heaves, \" **if I was not even in human form? **\" His words hit him. He launched towards him, his fist clenched, his entire body poised. His fist caught Zeus on the chin, pushing him over the edge, sending him careening down the mountain. The man stood there alone, breathing heavily. Had this truly happened? Had he punched a God? He felt himself being watched. He looked up, and various gods of the pantheon looked down at him, with varying expressions. Ares came down and patted him on the back, almost slamming him to the floor. \" Good job, man!\" Ares cried with vigour, as he looked towards the other gods. \" Did you guys see that? He fucking *nailed* him!\" \" Like Zeus did his wife,\" Dionysus joked under his breath. He gazed up at the gods. They were all so... *human*. So like him. Awe was replaced with disappointment, reverence with ridiculousness. It all felt so wrong, so pointless. He turned away, and began to walk down the mountain. Ares stopped him, with a mixture of curiosity and concern. A thunderstorm was brewing around them. \" Are you sure you want to leave?\" Ares asked, his hand on his shoulder. \" When Zeus gets back he's going to *end you*.\" Already thunder could be heard in the distance. The man stared at him. \" My wife is a whore, and the Gods are mad,\" he said, as he walked towards the lightning. \" I'll make my own fate.\" **** The gods watched him go. Dionysus was the first to speak. \" You know mortals can not harm a god, right?\" Dionysus said to Ares.

Maybe it was finally time to see that doctor. \" No. It's time you cut this crap out and mind your own god damn business.\" If only he knew how crazy he sounded.

You should see a doctor.\" I stared at him and waited for the hamster in his skull to work the machinery. \" Even if you have to pay for it,\" he added. But he did n't know. I had n't told him. I could n't tell him. Who would believe me if I did? But it was a moot question; I really could n't tell him, because that was a stipulation of the Deal. The witch was ancient, and I could n't believe how fast she'd been able to move. She went straight for me for some reason, while I had been walking down South Congress, flying out of one of those odd curio shops that seemed to be peppered around that part of Austin, like a grackle that had just spotted someone's leftover french fries. She'd shot an age-spotted finger at my heart, flipping out from under her poncho like a switchblade knife from its handle, and stared at me from within sunken eyes and croaked, \" You may have one wish.\" \" I wish I could have whatever I wanted without paying money for it,\" I'd replied instantly. It had been something I'd always thought about. \" Granted,\" she croaked. \" You can speak to no one of this,\" she added. She flew back down the street behind me, but when I turned, I could n't see where she'd gone. It seemed an odd story and nothing else until I made it to Jack in the Box, ordered my cheap tacos, and found the guy handing me a receipt without having paid him. I looked at him about to ask, and that's when I realized I could n't talk. But then I saw his eyes... Those eyes. Those eyes have which have followed me around ever since. Were they the witch's eyes, what lurked hidden in the shadows of those sunken sockets? Or were they some demon's? A red glow, a dull expression on the checkout counter person's face, and a receipt and -- in two minutes flat, tacos. When the next customer in line ordered, he took their money normally, his eyes returned to the bored expression he'd had before. Dan shook my shoulder. \" Hey, I lost you for a second there. You back?\" The mechanic was standing next to us holding a clipboard. \" Are you James Wayne?\" he asked. I nodded in assent. \" Broken head gaskets. You're looking at... \" and then the gaze of the mechanic glazed over, a slight hint of a glow appeared, but then he recovered. \" Tell you what, I'll let you two talk about this.\" I looked over at Dan, to see if he saw what I'd seen. \" You ca n't afford that. Especially not if you're heading to the doctor soon.\" \" Which you are,\" he added quickly. I looked at my old friend Dan. Dan, who had stuck by me, who had helped me buy groceries the past two weeks, who had watched me with patient eyes during my spending sprees and had helped me live as I no longer could pay. I looked him carefully in the eyes and asked, \" How much did the mechanic say it would cost?\" The eyes that looked back at me were still Dan's as he said, \" More than you can afford.\" \" Yes, I understand, that, Dan. But how much?\" The incident at Jack in the Box had seemed, like the visit of the witch, to be just an odd event; another day of Austin keeping it Weird. Then it happened again when I bought groceries. Then again at the liquor store. Each time, I'd see those same eyes, those glowing red orbs. And as the price increased, I started to notice a twinge. It was like the feeling you get when you get away with lying to your mother for the first time; it was like the feeling you get when you came home late for work after fucking your co-worker. It was like the feeling of telling your son you were too busy to play with him as you loaded the next level of Call of Duty. It was like the feeling of taking a paycheck for denying health insurance to someone with a chronic disease based on company policy. But like those incidents, the more you do them, the less you notice those twinges, and so I soon became accustomed to just taking what I wanted and bolting. And then I got bold. The 458 was the biggest extravagance. That felt horrible to walk away with, but then I got it out in the hill country for a spin around some less-traveled twisted roads, and I felt a lot better about it. It was also the point where I noticed people looking at me oddly. Parents would clutch their kids more tightly as I passed by. Young women would cross the street if I was heading in their direction. Dogs began to bark at me incessantly. Cats would hiss and flee. And through it all, the Austin Summer felt hotter in a way it never had before, the sky seemed never to be light enough. I began sitting in the house with all the lights on if I could, all night, back when I could still have the electric bill paid. Now I was scared and frightened. My soul was all but gone. I understood, now. It was a bit of soul for each purchase. And now I was down to my last bit. I did n't know the exchange rate, but it was n't enough to buy a sandwich, but enough to keep me from becoming a walking corpse. The sky was permanently dark; the sun just a bright star to my eyes. People avoided me; animals hated and feared me. Everything felt icy cold and fiery hot at the same time. I could barely feel the gnawing hunger in my belly or the exhaustion in my brain, because what was left of me to feel? \" Come on, James. Let's get a sandwich. I'll take you to the hospital.\" I slowly lifted myself out of the seat, and began following my friend to his truck. From there, we made our way to the hospital, to the emergency room. But before we made it inside from the parking lot, I stopped walking. I knew what medical bills cost without insurance; I also knew that Dan had a baby on the way, and did n't make much from his gig at the studio. \" Dan...\" I moaned. He looked at me. I looked at him right in the eyes. How could I do this? What *was* the exchange rate? \" I ca n't let you pay for me,\" I told him. I felt my tongue, dry and swollen, lisping out the words. \" You have that baby to think of. You need that money. I do n't need the charity, and what's wrong with me... it's more than physical.\" I looked again at Dan's eyes, but they were the same as always. How to do it? \" I'm done. And I thank you.\" \" Do n't talk like that, James. I...\" \" I'm dead. A dead man walking. But you, you still have your life. So, here...\" And I looked him right in the eyes. But his eyes were still the same as they had always been. \" I'll pay,\" I said. \" I'll pay you. I'll give you the last bit. Everything. Every penny.\" \" What are you talking about, James?\" Dan said, his brow furrowing. \" Every... bit...\" Dan's eyes were still the same, but I felt something, something inside. I thought about all the trips he'd taken me on. About the baby. I thought further back, about how he'd helped me buy a guitar. The time he'd stood between us when that bully George Robinson had tried to beat me up in sixth grade. I thought of every last thing he'd done, all the struggles he'd had financially and with that big responsibility about to be born in a couple of months. And I felt something change, but his eyes remained the same. The darkness became complete and I collapsed. I came to in a well-lit hospital room. Dan was next to me, as was my family. \" You're looking a lot better,\" I heard Dan say. \" Thank you, Dan,\" I said, and I looked out the window at beautiful, bright blue skies.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

A man with a limp in his twenties was far from rare, but it was uncommon enough to warrant curious looks and tactless questions now and then. \" I'm hurt, you do n't believe I can show any type of actual bravery?\" Matthew kept his voice light to ensure that Mary knew his words were in jest rather than actual yelps of emotional trauma. \" I'll have you know the parents of that boy even visited me in the hospital to thank me in person. Least they could do I suppose, given the fact I saved their son.\" \" You were expecting some type of compensation for a good deed?\" Mary gave Matthew an expression of mock disgust. \" A little blood would have been appreciated at the time, but I'll take gratitude when offered I suppose.\" Matthew made sure to keep the mood light-hearted as this was usually the point where condolences rolled in, unbidden. Mary kept her eyes on her companion strolling with an even gait as opposed to her companion's slightly lilting stride. \" How did you get through the rehabilitation? You do n't seem like a very determined person to me.\" Matthew shot her a sour look knowing full well the devilish nature of his only friend. \" Believe it or not I was once quite a bit more popular than I appear to be now. I had friends, acquaintances, even managed to captivate an odd stranger here or there in the hospital with my friendly demeanor. All of them helped. They supported me, advised me, one time literally carried me.\" Matthew found himself slightly tired from their travels and decided to rest on a nearby bench, Mary followed suit, sitting directly next to him. \" Do you remember all the people that helped you?\" Mary asked. Matthew sensed a small amount of trepidation in her voice, but unable to formulate a reason for it decided to simply ignore it. \" Three people stand out the most to me. Mike, Joseph and the rather curious nurse whose name I never grabbed.\" On hearing the list of persons Mary inhaled quietly. curious, but to in a story telling groove to stop and question her, Matthew continued. \" Mike was a friend I made in the later steps of my rehab, he was always encouraging me, even when I lashed out in return. Joseph was just a guy who ate lunch outside the building who I met early on, we just talked about nothing, but it was important to me. The nurse, I met shortly after I woke up and the doctors told me my chances of ever walking again were about equal with experiencing a shark attack. I guess he was just in the right place at the right time.\" Matthew paused for a moment, reflecting on his trio of past encounters which he was speaking on. Mary took this chance to ask, \" what did the nurse do that was so special?\" Her voice, usually so curt in asking personal questions was wavering slightly. Matthew, interrupted from his pondering glanced at her then gave a non-committal shrug before answering. \" He wanted to know why I risked my life for a complete stranger. I guess he thought I was some heroic type, imagine his surprise when I answered with...\" \" I just thought this would be a good way to die.\" The phrase came not from Matthew's mouth but Mary's. Matthew halted in his sentence abruptly turning to examine Mary. She was looking away, unwilling to meet his eye. \" How would you...\" Matthew struggled to find words to communicate his surprise. Mary took a steadying breath before speaking. \" You said you were just an empty, boring person and that to give your life to another with even a shred of potential was probably the better choice. Then **I** told you that you may want to try to reach your own potential before giving it all to someone else.\" Matthew sat still as a corpse, mouth agape, attempting in vain to process what he had just heard. A jogger passed by their bench, his footsteps the only sound that broke the silence that had enveloped the surrounding area. Finally, Matthew found his voice from the abyss of shock he had almost lost it in. \" Mary..... what do you mean? how do you know that?\" He tried to keep his voice absent of any tone of fear or accusation. Judging by the hurt expression Mary was sporting, he failed. \" I was that nurse, that's how I know what you said.\" Mary spoke with a voice that was fragile enough to break with a misplaced breath. \" well you certainly look a good deal more attractive, probably the lack of a goatee.\" Matthew joked hoping to goad a explanation from Mary. \" I was also Mike and Joseph, I can be anyone I want, I've been near you for a long time.\" ( Teasing tactic successful, Maybe I should do this whenever I want a straight answer ) Matthew decided to ask the obvious question first. \" How is that possible, what are you?\" Mary flinched slightly at being mentioned as a **what**, but answered in halting tones. \" I'm not sure myself..... I was just born like this, I could always change my appearance at will. I never stayed as one person or in one place for too long because someone always found out.\" Matthew pointed out a inconsistency in her words. \" You're telling me right now, and you've apparently been observing me for some time now, that does n't strike me as particularly nomadic.\" Mary nodded, her head hanging down, hiding her face behind her long auburn hair. \" I wanted to know what kind of person would do what you did. After you told me how empty you felt, I wanted to show you what I saw from the start, what you could become.\" Matthew laughed nervously, \" And you sought to accomplish this by keeping me in a masked state of seclusion?\" The question had more than a hint of sarcasm and anger. \" No no no....\" Mary denied the poorly veiled accusation vehemently. She inhaled and exhaled rapidly, while Matthew attempted to pierce her barrier of hair with his glare. Mary finally gathered her composure and continued. \" At first I was just curious about what kind of person you were, but as I saw you change and grow, I wanted more.\" Matthew relaxed his tense posture somewhat, unable to ignore the empathy he felt towards her desires. \" what do you mean?\" He asked much more gently this time. Mary looked up to return his gaze for the first time in what seemed like a century. She seemed to be choosing her words carefully. \" It started out as simple curiosity, then I wanted to know you personally rather than just observe you, so I became Joseph hoping to know you better. Soon that was n't enough, I wanted to be friends with you so I became Mike, I hoped I could support you through the challenges you were facing.\" Matthew silently gave thanks he was already sitting, given the circumstances falling flat from shock seemed likely. \" And now.... What did you hope for now when you changed into Mary?\" Matthew asked, his head overflowing with a million more questions. Mary steeled herself, her gaze directly meeting Matthew's. \" I wanted to love you.\" Matthew exhaled a long steady breath as he brought his head between the meager shelter of his hands. After a long period with his attempts at rationalizing the situation failing one after another, he re-emerged from his only safe place and turned back to face Mary. \" Did I become the person you saw at the beginning? The person you thought I could always become?\" Matthew inquired, no small amount of exhaustion audible in his voice. Mary shook her head, just a little to hard, leaving her in a disheveled state. \" No, you became someone much harsher, far less personable and more bitter than I ever thought you would.\" Matthew could n't help but shoot her another of his patented sour expressions, the second he gave her today. Mary continued with a slight giggle, after she sees this, regaining some of the sense of normalcy in their interactions. \" You also became someone much kinder, more dependable and more selfless than i could have imagined.\" Matthew allowed some measure of pride to enter his face before looking away. Clapping his hands together he stood up quickly from the bench and looked down at Mary. \" Let's keep walking.\" He suggested nonchalantly. Mary rose just as quickly to catch up and entered the same pace beside him. \" I suppose this strange situation is positive for both of us then.\" Matthew spoke his gaze still leveled straight ahead. \" I've always wanted to thank the people who helped me turn out just a little less meager.\" He let the sentence hang in the air for a good while before he received a reply. \" Is gratitude all I get for helping you all those times?\" the response came in the form of a greedy attempt for compensation. Matthew was n't about to let this go unanswered. \" I could give you some of My blood. Your kind drink blood, right?\" He kept his tone light so as not to let Mary misunderstand the jab for what it was. Her delightful and impish laughter assured him he succeeded. \" Well maybe you do deserve something for the most disturbing and persistent courtship in recorded history. How about dinner tomorrow night?\" Matthew asked, reveling in the fact that he probably had more assurance of a positive response than most men ever will. Mary looked up at him with a smile crossing her face and replied. \" Sounds acceptable, who knows, with this I can still accept the offer of blood too.\" Matthew grasped his jugular in mock horror and laughed. Just another laugh shared between us over the years.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Our computers took a while, but eventually generated an audio line from the static. It was then all hell broke loose. Symptoms started out with general aphasia, developing into schizophrenia and dementia. Victims would go through some unknown physical change where their larynx and mouths would begin to deform into grotesque shapes to mimic the sounds. An auditory plague descended upon humanity. Nukes were set off to destroy all communication relays and stop the spread of the sound through any media venues. There was no known cure, and the only vaccine was to inflict deafness. Humanity has crumbled, all from the uttering of lost words from distant eons. The creatures that roam this planet now have only two goals. Propagate and destroy anything that they can not infect. The resistance destroyed the last radio station, and the strangest thing began to happen. The infected gathered in canyons, in quarries and linked arms. They faced the skies and cried out. The only living witnesses observed masses of them become motionless except for their mouths. The ground rumbled and if they could hear, they'd hear roaring of their cries in harmonic unison as they began to echo their mimetic infection for as long as their bodies would hold.

We do n't know that for sure, but we do n't dare try to find out. Besides, we like it here. There's a big tree here. It bears plump, red apples. We like to cook delicious pies with them. I am glad it is n't the only thing we eat, though. There's also a patch of sunflowers we take care of. I like sunflowers. I can just sit and stare at them for ages... they invoke a feeling inside of me I can not really explain. A feeling of... peace and completeness.

Sometimes they are strange. Sometimes it's food. Syret particularly likes it when food floats onto the island. He's a little strange sometimes, but he's my only company. Actually, I do n't remember clearly how he got here. I just sort of remember him... appearing. He did n't even have a name he could recall when I asked him what it was. So I gave him one. He seems to be perfectly content with his name. It does n't bother him at all. He just sort of goes with things, you know? He is always relaxed, and he never stops smiling. He is a large dragon, with three heads. I often get lost in his six eyes and his dark red scales. Something interesting landed on the island today. It was some sort of... vessel. It was shiny, and it glowed with a green hue. Shortly after landing, the hatch on it's roof opened. And someone emerged. He wore a coat with a pattern of colorful interlocking circles on it, and a peculiar cylindrical hat with feathers attached to it's top. He was n't surprised when he saw me. He was n't even surprised when he saw Syret, the magnificent form he has. He just greeted us enthusiastically, and requested our names. Syret gave his. The man turned his head to me, with a warm and inviting smile. I explained to him I do n't really have a name I like. Syret suggests names to me often. I always tell him I either do n't think it makes sense, or I just do n't like the way it sounds. \" That's no good,\" He said, still smiling faintly. \" Everyone should have a name!\" He looks around for a second, spots our sunflower patch, then looks back at me. \" How about'sunflower?'Seems fitting.\" \" What do you mean,'seems fitting?\"'I ask. \" You're calm, but at the same time you burst with so many colors and emotions.

We have discussed this and we are moving onto a new topic of conversation. Have I made myself clear! Alright then. Janice what's next on the agenda\" Janice cleared her throat looking around. This really had degraded lately Darrel had been handling things well but parents were starting to get upset with the accidents that had been taking place on the playground after school. Students were still using the playground even though it had been restricted strict rules about walking home with an adult had been put in place. It did n't matter at least one student a week had been disappear since the start of September and now that it was December everyone was on edge. They expected the PTA to fix it and the PTA to fix it. More importantly the parents expected the teachers to fix it. \" Ummm, next on the agenda is the food in the cafeteria, the lunch staff would like to add a few menu items and wanted to know what parents thought.\" This was an old item from before but meetings had been going so slowly that the items had started to pile up. \" They want to know if it would be alright to add pizza subs to..\" Janice was cut off by a rolling boom in the back of the room. \" Who the fuck cares what food they are serving in the lunch room I WANT ANSWERS!\" Janice could n't see who it was in the back yelling. Probably a parent who had lost a child, they still attended the meetings and as much as Darrel did n't want them coming to distract the meetings further he could n't bar parents. Even if their child was missing they were technically still enrolled and some had other children still attending. Darrel poked his head up then dropped them into his hands. He mumbled something as Carol sunk lower into her chair. She was hoping she could slide right out of there. Someone said \" What was that Darrel? Are you patronizing us!\" \" No I'm not, I have n't since day one. Do n't you think this tears me up inside as well? It does. We have hired an active police presence in the yard and a have instituted mandatory parent to child policies when entering and leaving the school. Recess is no longer outside and we have tried our best to restrict access to the playground. There is NOTHING! NOTHING I would rather do than to do more but besides paving that whole area to the ground, we ca n't do a damn thing.\" Darrel draped his head into his hands, he looked like he was going to cry. \" Are you saying it's hopeless for my child!\" A man was making his way to the front. \" That he's just gone and I should give up? Is that what you are trying to tell me?\" \" No\" Darrel spoke into his hands but loud enough for everyone to hear. \" Then we need to do something, where are they going\" Darrel looked up from his hands to see the tall Kraven child's dad standing beaming with anger in front of him. \" I do n't think any of us should blame you, or the school Darrel but we ca n't keep not talking about what's going on. Something is happening in that equipment. Someone is taking our children somehow. Making them disappear. I do n't know if Sam is dead or alive. I just know he's gone and I want to find out what happened to him, I want answers.\" Some of the other parents were angry about his comments, people who had ignored the fact that they might not see their children again. Mr. Kraven had been one of the first to loose his kid and had the most time to come to terms with it.

Kay Cee and me met strangely enough, at lunch. While she does n't eat, her human friends do, so she was in the cafe talking when I met her. Since androids do n't have a adolescent period, they do n't have much of a childhood. She was technically twelve years old when she was studying for her doctorate in English. But for all points and purposes, she was a woman in her late twenties with complete amnesia regarding her youth. They really worked on avoiding the uncanny valley. And so while the first generation was more robotic like and obviously artificial, she was unnoticeable from a normal human being. She dyed her hair brown, and braided it. She dressed like any normal girl her apparent age. The only give away was her eyes. She has the most regal deep purple eyes I have ever seen. They're mesmerizing. I did n't speak to her that first day, but the day after next, I asked her out. To my dual surprise and delight, she said yes. We started dating after that. For much of it, a lot of our dates were simple things I had done as a young boy, sledding in wintertime, kite flying, fishing. She wanted to experience something she had not tried before. I loved it. I got to do all the things I used to do. It was like the C.S. Lewis quote, \" When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up\" We fell deeply in love. We got married three years later.

He shuddered from the rush that hit. He had seen the humans, with their tools and their weapons. He wove threads into clothes much like theirs and wove straw into baskets much like theirs. His tongue was versatile, and he wove their tongue into it. The snake was no longer a snake. He took their form and examined himself in the spring of life. When he was satisfied down to the last detail, he wove his way to the town that they were erecting out of nothing. The first thing that anyone saw on the approach was the pair of ships, looming and formidable. The day made long shadows of them. The snake could have swallowed them whole as the humans approached Eden, of course. But it would have been no fun. Finally, he had had visitors. Smoke rose high into the sky from the half-built town. The snake knew fire. He had seen the prancing demon of orange that could squeak or roar, that could warm or cook or kill. Fire was good. He had made sure to hone himself into its master. The snake approached the town. An eclectic mix of sounds filled the air, with eager men who made it everyone's business to hear what they were willing to barter their commodity of choice for and the honest thud of metal piercing earth, or mallets knocking wood or metal screeching against metal. The snake blinked, waved his head and blinked once more. Again and again, he seemed to lay eyes on what humans could not fathom. He found what he was seeking, and made a straight path to it. A big man was chopping wood in the outskirts of town. He would build with the wood and allow the town to encroach upon the Garden. The kind of man who builds is what the snake was looking for. And he was the biggest man by far, with the kindest heart. If they were God's children, such irony could only be expected. The snake was not sure of that yet, though. \" Greetings, human, \" the snake's first attempt was rough. \" Would you like an apple? \" \" No thank you, young lad. It is a kind offer but I was about to finish with my chopping. \" \" You can finish it later. The apple is sweet, I've tasted its brother from another branch. \" \" The chopping can hardly wait. If I sit around, the day would be over. Only so many days can pass before the year is over. And soon we would not have quite enough roofs above our heads. \" \" That is true indeed. Go ahead and chop, I will watch and learn and perhaps we can build roofs together, \" the snake said. The man smiled for the first time, glad that his point was seen. \" Watch me closely, \" he said as he turned to a tree that was three times his height. With a smooth twist in his body and a thrust in his arms he brought the axe to the same wound of the trunk, again and again. The snake watched, fuming. Finally, the tree fell by its own weight. The snake could cry but he wasn't about to. Instead he said, \" You've done great. Come have your apple now. \" The apple was bright and shiny. The man was panting of thirst and fatigue. The snake was smiling, a traditional expression that bared his fangs as if he trusted the person enough to declare all his weapons. Except he did not have fangs at that moment. The man took the apple and it crunched between his teeth. The snake smiled as the man was engulfed by a fit of coughs. His skin began to take on a blue colouration. His new name would be Blue, Satan decided, and he would be the first of his generals and the builder of Hell. -- - I am building the Rift-Edoras universe, prompt by prompt.

To test your theory, you start pushing your luck.", "output": "\" Alright Big Guy, let's do this.\" I leapt from the roof of the school, eerily aware of how easily this could go wrong. I had, of course, faith in the big guy upstairs, or whoever was helping me out. To be honest I never really gave it much thought until recently. I'd always think, *'Huh, that's neat,'* whenever luck went my way. Bad situations just turned out right. It was n't until three muggers tried gutting me like a fish that I realized something might be up. I mean, what's the chance of him missing me *and* stabbing his two buddies? On my way back home I had started to think about it and the rest of my life, and how these situations were n't actually that unusual for me. So what led me to suicide, you might ask? Well, first I'm going to have to correct you: this is n't your typical suicide. After my event with the three stooges, I had become painfully aware of how easy it was for me to *not die*. I recalled third grade and how Sarah's flying pair of scissors narrowly missed me and instead crash-landed in Mrs. Tebach's wig. Or how I flipped over on my bike, only to land in a conveniently placed pile of mattresses on my neighbor's lawn; unfortunately the bike went right into poor old Bobby's head. My strange luck had gotten me out of terrible misfortunes. Realizing that, I had begun to think that maybe someone or *something* has my back. So yeah, I decided to push my luck. I looked below me, at the sea of horrified students and teachers alike. I had climbed and jumped off the tallest building on campus, giving my personal angel enough time to step in. I think I have about 3~ish seconds before I hit the ground. Any time now... Just then I felt it. The clouds parted above me. I could feel time slow down... Everything stopped. Then I heard an eruption of sound, coming from the sky: **GODDAMMIT YA LITTLE SHIET! DO YA KNOW HOW MUCH I'VE BUSTED ME ARSE TRYIN'TA KEEP YUH ALIVE?! I'VE HAD ENOUGH. FROM NOW ON YER ON YER OWN. SO LONG, FUCKFACE. **", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It looked about the size of a small dog and had a bluish color to its body. His tail and paws were all white. He adjusted his thick black glasses and moved in closer to the screen. \" Um... Is that... Is that a cat?\" Eric looked behind him. The cat had cornered a small brown mouse under one of the other computer consoles. His blue and white tail up and waving around. In his paws the cat inexplicably held one of the laptops that had been left from one of the previous missions. He raised it over his head ready for the mouse to make a wrong move. \" Care to explain where the cat came from?\" \" Uh... yes. About the cat. You see while we were doing some routine maintenance of the outside of the ship one of the cosmonauts inside detected a small round object hurtling toward us.

The mouse ran out into the middle of the station with the cat hot on its heals using the laptop to swat at the rodent. An angry determined look was on his face as he locked on his bothersome prey. The mouse jumped and grabbed onto one of the wires hanging from the ceiling and swung down the hallway leaving the cat floating in mid air confused. The signal went offline. \" ISS?... ISS?

I learned after the fifth night to stop trying to turn my alarm off, as the last five alarms are now Pop Tarts. I tried on the third morning to toast my Pop Tart blanket, but failed ultimately, as my toaster oven is now Pop Tarts. Now I simply use the Pop Tarts to try and move the dials on my new toaster oven. This is hard, because the dials stick, and Pop Tarts are crumbly. 8:15am: I step into the shower and hope that this time I can manage to scrape some filth off of me. Unfortunately any water that comes into contact with my body transforms into Pop Tarts ( curiously, it seems that solids turn to Pop Tarts if they touch my hands, but liquids need only touch any part of my body. Gases seem strangely unaffected. ), so there is n't much I can do save soap up the Pop Tarts and scrub them on my body. This is ineffective, and my shower is soon filled to my ankles with Pop Tarts. The law of conservation of mass is apparently a cruel hoax. 8:30am: I take great care to put my clothes on without touching my hands to the clothing itself. I fail with the first shirt, but the flannel shirt I put on seems to be immune to this curse. Then the flannel shirt also turns into Pop Tarts. I do not know if this is evidence there is no God, or proof there is, and he is laughing. 9:00am: I am finally dressed. As a solemn protest to the fates, I refuse to eat Pop Tarts for breakfast. Instead, I pour myself a bowl of dry cereal, and cradle my spoon between two Pop Tarts to begin my meal. This is Hell. 11:45am: After several hours of bemoaning my existence and profaning the powers that be, I decide to experiment. I want to see if the types of Pop Tarts produced are dependent on their source material. After testing various substances, I've determined that most fabrics become chocolate fudge Pop Tarts, whereas plastics tend to turn into various fruit varieties. The leftover confetti cupcake Pop Tarts I had from before this whole ordeal started have curiously all changed to cherry. My faith for the future wanes. 1:37pm: I have made a grave mistake.

He took another look at therapy leader and felt something boiling inside. An intense feeling like he was n't allowed to feel. He took another sip of coffee as eternity felt like an eternity. He looked at Barachiel, whose eyes lost the spark they used to have. \" It makes me a little bit sad...\" Talking about an understatement... Abbadon was so sick and tired of these after action reports for lessons learned. He knew he fucked up. There was no easy way around it. But to take Barachiel with him in his fall... \" Do you feel betrayed?\" He saw Barachiel hesitate, looking towards the ground while shucking with his shoulders. He knew how many angels were looking for a promotion. A promotion that would mean that an archangel would have to be demoted. He knew that no one envied the position of Barachiel, because that would n't be tolerated by The Big Man. Hell, you ca n't even have some pride in your work these days without Him having something to say about it... \" Yes\" \" By whom?\" He felt the two eyes, who once had the power to light the sky, slowly but surely, burning a path from the floor towards him. This once great Archangel was a fraction of his former self. Abbadon could n't, no, would n't allow this farce to continue... \" I take the blame!!!\" Total silence as everyone stood flabbergasted. \" I take the blame for everything... It's all my fault, but I'll be damned if you did n't trick me into this...\" Micheal put his counselling notebook down, and stared intensely into his eyes. Abbadon knew that he could n't step back anymore, he knew he had to save his friend. \" Take a long good look at yourself, all you judgemental son of bitches... I knew I'd get all the basket cases, but I never thought you would sink so low as to get me that... that... monster!\" He felt his anger raging up inside as he saw a single tear shed down Barachiel's cheek. He felt that this was the right thing to do. \" I never trusted you lot, and I should had know better. But you fucking tricked me in to it. O, it would be great you said. O, no more homeless persons for you this time... O, we've got quite the person for you... And I believed you.. O, you'll go love him, you said. O, he is a real animal lover, he is a vegetarian, would n't that be great after all those shitty people who were cruel against animals that I had to guard, would n't that be a welcome change you said! O, you'll do n't have to worry about children you said. It was determined that he would n't multiply, better yet, he does n't even drink!! Would n't that be a welcome change for all the child molesting drunkards you had before, you said... And not just a person you said, he would be famous in his day, a famous writer whose book would be in every house trough out his nation. Better yet, his name would be remembered for generations and generations to come, you said. And I believed you.... And then the ultimate incentive, I could work close together with my good friend Barachiel, you said. He would guard a lovely young girl and they would fall in love with each other... They would marry, till death would part them..\" No angel dared to move. He stared intensely into Micheal's eyes while feeling red hot with rage. Micheal scraped his voice, and finally broke the silence. \" Well, technically you were together till death parted you\" \" Get that fucking disgusting smile of your face, you make me sick. You knew what would happen.. You knew he would shoot her, and you made us witness it... You knew I would give everything to make you see I have what it takes to be a good guardian of the more influential folks on that god forsaken planet... You KNEW I would n't let him out of my sight, and you know what. I did my fucking part. It is not my fault that mad bastard killed himself.\" It felt so fucking good getting this of his chest. He stepped towards Micheal and raised his finger at him. \" Are n't you going to ask me how I feel about it? You bureaucratic piece of shit? Well, I feel fucking great! Every stupid little scheme to end his life was prevented by me. Mustard gas??? For Him's sake, they even tried to bomb the little fucker not once, but twice!!! The first time I could quickly change his schedule without anyone noticing so that the bomb exploded without him near it. The universe stepped up his game and so did I! A bomb in a fucking locked off concrete bunker??? Hell, if I did n't place the bomb behind the heavy wooden table there would be a lot less guardian angels waiting for a newborn to guard... I helped him every step of the way, just to prove that I was good as everyone here, and you know what... I not only succeeded, I proved to be better than all you wankers combined! Because I saved him from everything the Free World could throw at him, and more. Most importantly, I did my part but that bastard decided to take his own life, and it is against company policy to intervene with his free will. So you wan na feel how I feel??? I feel like a fucking million bucks!!! Fuck all you haters, I have never been so fucking proud in my life at my accomplishment!\" \" Yeah, well here is the thing about that\", said God as He puts His hand on Abbadon's shoulder. \" Such feelings are also against company policy, and I'm afraid I have to enforce my one-strike-policy within my business.

Everyone around me looked up almost simultaneously as if the ceiling would give them more information. It did n't. Nothing more came from the overhead speaker, and no one moved or said anything. Until a scream came from the other side of the store, near the manager's office. A large man with a baseball bat covered in blood was running towards a couple picking out cabbage. \" Get away from my wife!\" He screamed while charging. The costumers around me began shuffling around trying to shield their children's eyes or escape as soon as possible, but I do n't think anyone was exempt from witnessing the mayhem. The angry man rushed towards the couple and swung at the man, missing completely. The women, obviously fearing for her life swung her enormous hand bag hitting the back of the abuser's head, knocking him to the ground. Unwilling to give up the fight, he continued swinging, hitting everything within a two foot radius to his hands, including his arms, stomach, and eventually his own head which rendered him unconscious. \" GO TO HELL YOU CHEATING, JEALOUS BASTARD!\" Screamed the woman. She then turned to the other man and said with an almost disturbing amount of calmness \" Let's go, Richard.\" I truly had no idea what had just transpired in the produce section, but I did know that not only was there a mess waiting for me on aisle five, there was a new man-shaped mess waiting for me by the cabbage.

{"input": "Earth develops lightspeed travel and sends colony ships to uninhabited worlds. You are one of the colonists. Surprisingly, due to relativistic time dilation, your ship arrives to a planet already heavily colonized by Humans who developed much faster travel 25 years after you left.", "output": "It was 2129 and Erk was sitting at home recovering from his recent upgrades at the Bionetic Enhancement Lounge that just opened up at the Walmart down the street. For the past couple decades all newborns were already set up for success and practically immortal life before they were even born. Ease of genetic modification and new discoveries in cybernetic human tissue had advanced greatly in a short time after a few breakthroughs had been achieved and people could be set up with artificial limbs, organs, cosmetic body enhancements, etc that were easily interchangeable and would grow with you as you aged. Of course aging was only a technicality now, with this same technology entire artificial human bodies could be developed and a newborns consciousness could be transferred and matured at birth almost instantly to the new host body. Exponentially growing population and ethics had caused quite the controversy and soon the United Ameriasia Committee had outlawed artificial maturation and body swaps to full cyborg bodies in an effort to control the population. Since WW3 just 85 years ago entire ethnicities were wiped off the map and even with advancements in atmospheric regeneration more then one third of the world was still uninhabitable due to basically being written off from intense radiation/ loss of atmosphere and decimated land masses, only the largest and most tech advanced countries that were n't completely wiped out were able to rebuild the world around them basically leaving nothing but North America and parts of Asia. Even with these efforts it was only a matter of time before the Earths remaining resources could support the people on this planet and it was a mad race to find their next home. A perfect match for New Earth had been discovered many years ago but being 50 light years away had left it nothing but a distant dream until recently. As Erk laid down he muttered something \" Home, Enable\" he just had his revision two vr optics replaced with revision 4 at Walmart and no longer had to manually plug in to his pc just to access the full dive neural network. Most people lived in pods barely large enough for a bed, and bathroom there just was not enough room for everyone and he was on the 150th floor sharing a building with fifty thousand other residents, luckily the elevator was quick. This really did n't matter much since once you were on the net your apartment was whatever you wanted it to be whether a cozy loft or a mansion and if it was n't for built in fail safes for people who could n't afford auto nourishment and waste disposal you would quickly forget it was n't real life. In fact before laws were passed requiring net providers to include these fail safes it was not uncommon to hear about a death at least once a night on Reddit, usually posted as some random meme. Erk decided to hop in his classic 2026 mustang he had in the garage and cruise around old town New York before the war, he enjoyed escaping from the current reality and experiencing what Earth used to be. It was nice not feeling the ever so slight tug of the high bandwidth fiber cables plugged into his skull they never managed to figure out how to get rid of that sensation before switching to wireless and while you felt like you were fully in another world if you touched the right spot on your head you could still fell the connection even if you could n't see it. He enjoyed the ride, before returning home, making some dinner and passing out. Erk was one of the few people who had a reason to get up and out of the network in the morning, unemployment had reached 90 % many years ever since basic income was instated and the network became a universal human right. Most functions were automated in the world and money did n't really have much of a meaning anymore considering you lived your wildest dreams as long as you were on the net so most people could n't complain. Erk's apartment complex included monthly nourishment refills and waste disposal hookups so as long as nothing broke or glitched out it was pretty rare to see someone leave their pod and thanks to all the cybernetic augmentations people stayed alive and healthy despite doing nothing but laying in a bed for months or even years at a time. Even still every morning for the past 2 years Erk had got up and headed downtown for his assignment, he was training and preparing for the maiden voyage to New Earth. The voyage had not been made public knowledge up to this point of its inception nearly 30 years ago and Erk was n't even sure himself what he was training for up until just a couple months ago. The participants were under the impression this was a just a basic space mission to one of the many surrounding stations and the benefits it provided seemed to keep people happy and not asking questions. Training consisted of learning basic functions of the current ships that were used and how to perform basic repairs on air purifiers and water recyclers on board should the repair bots somehow fail but at the end of the day everyone knew that if something like that did go wrong they would n't really be able to do anything, the machinery was just too complicated. During the major debriefing not long ago everyone in the program was informed that speed of light travel had finally been perfected and the first launch would take place in 70 days and so it was not even two weeks left until they embarked at this point. It was explained that the flight would take fifty years time to reach New Earth and with quantum teleportation there would be an up to date up link with the network on earth and all the travelers would more or less continue their lives as normal during the trip living permanently vr until they arrived. With the amount of people on the trip there would not be enough room to free roam or store enough supplies to fund excessive calorie usage outside of the network so it was encouraged to get your life in order and be prepared to not exit for the entire trip because this would not be a possibility. Being hopeful there would be a second round of recruits and the next ship built and ready just 10 years after the first one left and this would repeat until anyone who was going to leave did. The next two weeks were completely uneventful, Erk had no family and spent his time preparing a comfortable reality to set up in once he boarded the ship. Most of the travelers had found a new home server to join and live together so they could get used to each others company and get to know each other, it was based on a fantasy model of Earth containing modern technology with topography based before the war, something that should n't be too far off from new Earth after all the terraforming and construction was completed by the onboard bots. Erk even downloaded a family a new car, hopefully they would n't be too annoying and end up getting drowned in the pool with ladder removed. Erk woke up the day of the journey, logged out of the net, took a shower for the first time in years just for the hell of it and headed downtown, he did n't even lock his pod he knew he was n't coming back. Upon arrival there was thousands of people surrounding the complex, they must of finally an announcement to the public Erk thought. The ship had been raised from underground and Erk had laid eyes on it for the first time, it was a massive behemoth of a space ship, it looked almost like an inflated over sized jumbo jet from the pre war with no windows and small wings, he could already see a line of people beginning to board and rushed to get checked in and get in line himself. The wait was once again uneventful, lots of gossip and speculation about the coming adventure but nothing really stood out. The main topic of discussion seemed to be what exactly was going to happen when they reached their destination, they knew the bots were going to terra form and set up the start of their new civilization but were they just being sent there to once again continue the same old life living in the net, or would they have a purpose? They had been assured it would all be outlined exactly what everyone's roll was at some point during the trip but all in all it was a mystery. Boarding the ship was pretty quick and easy despite the thousands of participants, the entrance led on to the ship past many closed doors until they reached long a set of long hallways, it was reminiscent of Erk's apartment complex with much smaller pods. All the rooms were identical, nothing but a very small bed to lay in and compartments on the wall, not even enough room to stand or move around, it was first come first serve and people were hurried to pick a pod and get out of the way to get everyone boarded up. The first thing that struck Erk as odd was that there was no Hi bandwidth fiber cables, he knew that not everyone had wireless optics, he brushed it off that they must be concealed someone in the compartments as well as the nourishment and waste hookups. Erk went to peak out into the hallway to see how the loading was going but discovered the door had locked behind him, better get comfy he thought its going to be a long fifty years. \" Home, Enable\" Erk stated, figured he would say hello to his new family while he waited for everyone to settle in and for someone to explain where the hookups were, it did n't work though, guess they did n't boot the ships network yet he thought. Before long a voice came over the speaker in the room and announced everyone had boarded and they were preparing lock down and launch procedures, it was at that point a Erk started to smell something funny and starting getting really tired followed by the room filling with a blue liquid, before the liquid was even an inch deep Erk could n't stay awake and had passed out, the room filled to the top and the speaker announced cryogenic preservation had been fully completed on board. Erk woke up groggy in a hospital room, he was greeted by a nurse \" Welcome to New Earth, you are a little late!\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The debris is revealed. Slowly the torrid dreams transform in his mind. Slowly they become him, and become his reality. Closest to him he sees the broken glass. A bottle of whisky flung against the wall in the heat of the moment. His eyes track along the floor, his stomach turns as the garish green carpet gradually turns to the distinctive deep brown-red colour that can only be blood. In the distance, sirens, his heart stops as he listens. They fade away almost as suddenly as they appeared. The carpet appears to be soaked with blood. His eyes search for the source, despite within himself, he knows the source. There on the bed his eyes begin to process the haunted face of his latest girlfriend; Geraldine. She had ended just like all those before her. It would always start so beautiful, he would take them all around town. Show them the world, show them his empire. For this town was his and his alone, there was no one else like him. Sighing, Graham turns away from Geraldine and steps through the broken glass. Opening the door and stepping out onto the front porch he is blinded by the bright morning sun. He always hated the morning, even as a child he always found himself better suited for the night-time. Graham found the morning too honest for his liking, he finds it easier to hide from reality in the dark of the night. As he staggers down the drive to his jeep, it occurs to him that he no longer knows how long he has been like this. How long he has been victim to his own insanity and its desires. In the distance, Sirens, he chuckles. At least he remembers how he went insane. The sirens. The endless sirens, they kept returning no matter what he did. The morning was always worst as for a moment he would forget himself. Forget that he was indestructible, a god unto himself. In the morning the first sirens, he would always feel the fear just for a moment. Again, they fade almost as soon as he acknowledges them. The streets, as always are deserted. Nothing but the odd burnt out car, charred remains of those apparently less lucky than him. This was why daylight was such a curse. In the night he could pretend the past had not happened. He could exist in his world. At night he could be happy. Sirens, again, with the sun high in the sky he knew it was all in his mind. This time it is for longer. He found they grow longer as the day grows older. Skidding to a halt, he stumbles into the liquor store. It looked far emptier than before. His insanity started a long time ago, he figures, for that was a lot of alcohol for him to drink. He was bored of the Jeep, he decides and starts to wander aimlessly down the desolate high street. A rat scurries out to investigate the commotion, before quickly retreating away from the strange being. As he wanders, his mind approaches sobriety. The hangover subsides, for a moment he is alone from the sirens, and he remembers the reality of the world. Countless days ago the world had ended in a brutal fashion. Chaos subsided and left him alone. For some reason, the chaos chose Graham to wander alone in the absence of civilisation. For a time he had hung on to his old habits. Tried to preserve civilization, kept up appearances for when other survivors found him. Then one day he realized the terrible truth. That there was no point to it all. Years of innovation, love and hard work. Years of human endeavour and it all came to this. To one average joe wandering the streets lost and alone. Swigging the whisky he looks left and right. That's when he turned towards the darkness. If there was no one left to judge him. Why pretend anymore. Why keep his urges to himself, why not unleash them on the world or what's left of it.

Her hair was hanging from a third floor window like a flag. He walked underneath her and looked upwards. Her face was beautiful. She looks like a Jessica, he decided. Smashing the door in, Graham makes short work of the barricades inside. It takes him a few attempts to find Jessica's room. She is sporting a rather delightful pink tank top and short cut-off jeans. But even more delightfully she seems to be in a relatively good state of decomposition. So many beautiful faces had been ruined by the passing of time. But Jessica still seemed quite fresh.

I need the stuff and I heard you are the only guy who sells it.\" Since I had the only magic shop in half the state, I pointed out that he could have been asking for anything in my store.

{"input": "\" The clock... watch the clock. When it moves we move, and when it stops we hide. \"", "output": "*Tick tock*... *tick tock*... *tick tock*... The pendulum hanging from the tall grandfather clock swung back and forth, glinting in the moonlight that streamed through a nearby picture window. The pale, silver light cast the large parlor in a ghastly glow. A forest of shadows crisscrossed the hardwood floors; long, slender fingers stretching out from the victoria-era furniture. It smelled of mildew and musk, with just a whiff of smoldering coals and smoke, as if a dying fire still simmered in the stone fireplace. The room could have easily been mistaken for a museum exhibit after dark, a perfectly preserved piece of history trapped in time and space. All except for the small girl, huddled in the corner with her knees pulled tightly to her chest, silent tears streaming down her face. Kayla Shore had been just seven years old when her and her parents had moved into the large, stately manor on the hill. It sat at the end of a long, winding driveway, set back from the road and protected by a tall, stone wall with only a black, iron gate allowing passage to and from. Inside, long, narrow hallways threaded between big, open rooms, secured by heavy, wooden doors. It creaked and groaned constantly ( something Kayla's father had said was just the house \" settling\" ) and, exposed on the hill as it was, howled when the wind swirled outside. It was the kind of place nightmares were made from. Almost from the beginning, Kayla was scared of her home. The ghost stories her classmates would tell about the house on the hill, as they would call it, did n't help matters. Gruesome tales of murders and disappearances, urban legends involving the The Hill House Killer or the Ghost in the Attic, and creepy occurrences centered around the house were the frequent topics of conversation at her lunch table or at recess, when older kids would get a sinister smile and she would know she would n't sleep that night. Her father would always calm her, checking beneath her bed and in her closet, reassuring her that there were no such things as ghosts and they were all perfectly safe. There was always confidence in his eyes. Kayla liked that. One time, after a particularly terrifying lunch period that day, Kayla awoke screaming from a nightmare. Her father had been away on business, so her mother came running into the room, wrapping her daughter in a nice, tight hug. Kayla told her mother all about the older boy, and how he had taunted her that day, telling her about the last family who lived in the house, how they had disappeared without a trace and no one knew why. About how it was only a matter of time until it happened to Kayla too. He had laughed, even as Kayla tried not to cry, knowing she would have to go home that afternoon, sleep in her big, empty bedroom that night, in the house that scared her. Her mother had tightened her hold and whispered in her ear, telling her the same things her father would: they were safe, there were no such things as ghosts, we love you, and everything is okay. Kayla missed those hugs. It was only a few months after that when her mother was murdered. She had n't been feeling well, so Kayla and her father left to run some errands so she could rest. Kayla could remember feeling funny that day, even running back to hug her mother and tell her she loved her one last time before they left. She did n't know why, but Kayla had known it was important to do so. When they returned, her mother was sitting in the parlor, dead. And old high-backed chair had been moved, twisted around to face the fireplace. Kayla's mother sat perfectly straight in the chair, stiff as a board, a look of terror and horror frozen on her face. The coroner's report came back inconclusive. There was no official, or even reasonable, cause of death. The police ruled it a suicide, due mainly to the lack of forced entry, and moved on. Kayla and her father did not. From that day forward, Kayla's father forbade her from going into that room. It remained untouched, and even passing it along the hall filled Kayla with a sense of dread and fear. Her nightmares worsened but now, when her father would come comfort her, the confidence was no longer in his eyes. It only served to worsen things and, after awhile, Kayla stopped going to her father for help. One night, a few years after her mother's death, Kayla had a terrible nightmare about the parlor. She awoke with a start, covered in sweat, tears streaming down her face. She crawled out of bed and made her way down the hallway toward her father's room, at the opposite end of the hall. She never made it. Instead, almost trance-like, she found herself standing in the middle of the parlor. She could n't remember making the decision to walk here, or actually doing so, only being one second in the hallway, and the next, in the parlor. That was when she noticed the clock. The tall grandfather clock against the wall in the corner had stopped ticking. The pendulum was frozen in the place, the hands on the clock holding steady, as if time was standing still. From behind her came a hissing sound, causing her to spin in place. The sound, like steam shooting from a break in a pipe, was coming from the fireplace. In a fit of panic, Kayla ran to the opposite corner of the room, cowering down behind a sofa. A feeling of cold dread passed over her and she fought the urge to scream. The back of her neck tingled with the feeling of being watched. Something was standing right behind her. Everything inside her told her to turn around, but she was frozen in place. She could n't look. She did n't know how she knew, but she knew, as firmly as she knew the sky was blue, that if she turned around she would die. Her next memory was waking up, still curled up in that spot behind the sofa, the next morning. That was four nights ago. Tonight, Kayla was determined to look. *Tick tock*... *tick tock*... *tick tock*... So she sat, fighting the terror inside her that was trying to force her to run back to her room and throw herself under her covers, curled into a ball in the corner of the room. In the corner to her right stood the large grandfather clock, still ticking away. Across the room to the left, against the far wall, was the fireplace. Each second seemed like a lifetime, the shadows on the floor first growing long and clear as the moon rose and shone through the window, then fading back into dark obscurity as the moon passed away. Kayla reminded herself, for the hundredth time, to keep breathing. That's when she noticed the clock had fallen silent. Her breath caught in her throat again and her eyes locked onto the fireplace. The hissing started again, as a low whine, growing in pitch until it was almost ear-shattering. Then Kayla saw the smoke. A tendril of smoke swirled up from the pit of the fireplace, building thicker and larger, until a hazy black cloud filled half the room. It floated in place, blacker than the darkness around it, swelling and rippling in place. The grandfather clock in the corner *ticked*, Kayla started, and the black haze swirled violently and disappeared back into the fireplace, as if being vacuumed away. Standing it its place was the last thing Kayla expected. A tall, lanky man, dressed in a top coat and scarf, glanced around the room, his bright, grey eyes eventually falling on Kayla. He frowned and cocked his head to the side, like an animal investigating its surroundings, then took a step forward. Kayla pressed back into the corner. \" You must be afraid,\" the man said, his voice warm and gentle. Kayla nodded, his voice putting her at ease. He did n't feel at all like the thing that came out of the fireplace the other night. His eyes knitted in concern and he nodded. \" As well you should. Do you mind?\" Kalya shook her head. The man walked over to her and sat down close next to her, copying her posture. He looked across at her, their noses almost touching. \" I'm not the only thing to come out of that fireplace, am I?\" \" No.\" Kayla shook her head. \" This other thing, gave you quite a fright, eh?\" \" Yeah.\" Kayla nodded. \" So I guess you wo n't mind the company.\" \" No,\" Kayla answered. She relaxed a bit, the man comforting her in a strange way. They sat in silence for a long time, the grandfather clock showing it was nearing dawn, when Kayla turned to him. \" The clock.\" The man looked at the clock, studying it. \" What about it?\" \" Watch the clock. When it moves, we're okay. When it stops, we hide.\" \" The clock stops, huh?\" \" It does,\" Kayla said. \" That's when the fireplace hisses.\" As though she spoke it into existence, the grandfather clock froze just as she finished. The ticking stopped, the pendulum once more hanging unnaturally in place. The fireplace whined once more and the tendril of smoke reappeared. Kayla's eyes went wide, her gaze fixed on the cloud. She could n't see the man, but his eyes, too, were locked on the cloud. The once bright eyes were filling with fear. \" Do you believe in ghosts, girl?\" \" My father says ghosts are n't real.\" \" He's right. There are no such things as ghosts.\" The cloud billowed, filling the other side of the room once more. \" Then why am I so afraid?\" Kayla asked, her voice trembling. Because, my dear girl,\" the man said quietly, \" unfortunately, there are worse things in this world than ghosts.\" The black cloud was rippling and whirling now, growing bigger and bigger, the hissing from the fireplace turning into an unnatural, low howl. \" I do n't think hiding is good idea,\" the man said. \" It's not going to stop it.\" \" What do we do then?\" Kayla asked. The man grabbed her hand and looked at her. \" Run.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

First you have to wake up.\" I opened my eyes to the familiar sound of my alarm clock beeping. I groaned as I reached over to hit the snooze button. That's when I remembered the dream I had. Not again, I thought. Every since my dad died in a working accident two months ago, I've been having the same dream over and over again without fail. Each time, I would be floating in a void of darkness while a lady would tell me to ask a question. I would ask where my dad went after his death. Then I would wake up. But despite the dream being weird, I just shrugged it off. It's just a dream, I thought, no point in thinking too hard about it. But walking to school that morning I could n't help but wonder why I was having the dream in the first place. What did the dream mean? I was so lost in thought that I did n't notice the truck going full speed down the street. I looked up from the crosswalk and then I saw it. It struck me with full force before I could get out of the way. When I woke up the first thing that I felt was the unbearable heat. I was shoulder-deep in what was most likely lava. I felt my flesh burning and it hurt. It hurt a lot! The pain was so overwhelming that I finally let out screams of agony. The realization hit me. I was in Hell. Over my own screams I heard the lady's voice in the back of my head. \" You're the one who wanted to know where your father went.

The Swarm ___ From around the corner in the blackness of night there was a snarl, like the snarl of a wolf who had just found his next meal. As he crept around the dark corner he was stunned as he felt claws digging into his sides and felt a slam on his chest. Later in that night on the news there were reports of thousands of incidents like these happening all over the world and nobody knew what they were. One case happened underneath a street light and a witness saw a flash of purple during the attack. Nobody knew what was happening to the world and nothing could have prepared them for what was to come. During the next morning some explorers started finding these weird flesh-like grounds where deserts used to be. The ground in these areas seemed to be made up of veins and a scaly mesh beneath. When these grounds were walked on people said they could feel vibrations coming from below, as if the ground had a beating heart. Throughout the day, multiple sightings of giant gaping maws sprouting out of the ground and the maws seemed to convert the nearby soil into the \" creep \" substance. Upon further investigation it seemed that the maws contained tunnels. Within the tunnels the explorers experienced much resistance from small, dog-like creatures with claws and fangs as sharp as kunais. During the following night, not a soul was sleeping as the ground pulsated like a giant heart was pumping in the very core of the Earth. This, of course, was not the case; it was far worse. As the night dragged on people came to realize that the attacks were only happening at night. The people had started to form a resistance and were holding the lines of their city borders. During the next day the pulsing coming from within the Earth grew more and more violent as the day went on. Explorer teams were sent to venture inside of the tunnels with protection so that the humans could find the correct place to strike. They were never heard from again. Production of nuclear missiles had begun in order to dispatch of the new scourge. New laws were being placed to protect the cities from collapsing due to lack of resources. These laws changed the lifestyle of many for worse, and many for better. One of the laws stated that all humans must consume the same amount of resources per day. Due to the lack of knowledge of the new threat some of the laws put in place screening processes for people to be even considered human. During the following night the pulsing grew so violent that some of the structures began to fall and crumble to the ground. The attacks on the borders had become so harsh that the human's borders were shrinking at alarming rates. At one point during the night there was a rumbling beneath the ground underneath a major city. Unlike the pulsing, this rumbling was much quieter, but sounded like something was being shoved forcefully through the Earth. The pulsing continued throughout about half of the next day, but then it suddenly stopped. All of the pulsing, everywhere on the Earth, just suddenly stopped, gone in the blink of an eye. This, of course, terrified some people and excited others. The terrified people were worried that the pulsing was the sound of the enemy working and it stopping signals that they are finished. The humans who were excited, were excited that they finally could sleep and the buildings would stop falling. Both of these feelings were justified. The following evening the screening processes of finding humans was made to be a lot harsher and included DNA tests to even be considered remotely human. After these rules were put in place the humans realized that their newfound enemy was actually sending human-like creatures back in place of their explorers in order to spy on them. During the next night, the humans were extremely tense and their borders were very tightly packed with guns and defense squads, but not a single bullet was fired throughout the night. The defense squads were very suspicious of one another because of the lack of attacks. Some of the people even started to fight other people because they were suspicious that others were actually their enemies. During the following morning, a rumble was felt throughout the Earth for about five minutes straight then stopped abruptly. A few hours later these small, triangular creatures with claws started to scratch at the bunkers on the edges of cities and they came in waves. After further investigation the humans found out that the small creatures were being flung from these huge flying creatures which seems to produce them, the smaller creatures expire after a few minutes.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Ohhh I have no friends in this world of pretendd!! * Yesterday the Pokemon GO app was finally released, the most expensive game ever created costing somewhere around 40 million dollars. It was the spoiled bastard child of Nintendo and Google, yeah, it's some real skynet shit. The worst part is the pleebs that I am forced to interact with from time to time do not even recognize the revolution of gaming that is happening before their eye's, no, they are truly blind, wasting time watching things like keeping up with the kardashians and football. I kicked up my fedora from the ground, caught it the dragonhead head-piece of my walking cane, before flinging it up again and doing a complete spin before landing on my spaghetti monster hairstyle. I unplugged whatever number I-phone we are at these days from the wall and checked up on my babies: A 590 CP Machamp, a 620 CP Gyrados, a 600 CP Poliwrath and to top it all off, one of my favorite pokemon, that I had bought in an online trade deal for only 530 $, a 740 CP Alakazam. Yes, me and my soldiers were a forced to be reckoned with, and to my estimation I was probably the most powerful trainer alive right now, for it had been a mere 31 hours from launch and already I have garnered such a potent fighting forced.

Getting up early on saturday mornings to watch pokemon, singing the song and of course the super hardcore pokemon rap that they do at the end of each episode. One time I did it for the school talent show and everyone was too intimidated to talk to me after it or something. I'm talking about myself a lot, but let me just say one more thing in an attempt to truly introduce you to my character: Everyone's mom tell's them they are special, most kid's never believe it, of the ones who do believe it most stop believing it at some point, but there are a very select few, a very rare breed of indigo child, that never forgets. I am one of the children. I twirled around and into my trenchcoat in a graceful ballet that would have earned me with a 3-some with mila kunis and natalie portman; after which I strapped on my fingerless gloves and skipped towards the door, yelling as I did: \" I'm heading out Mom!!!\" \" Okay Sweety!! When are you coming home?\" \" Whenever I feel like it geez!\" I slammed the door behind me so she knew I was serious, my parents would never understand me, they were such sheeple. The sun was hot and low in the sky but today my will was iron, I proceeded step by sacred step and struggled to maintain focus against the elements that were before me: sweltering sun-rays beating down upon my fair complexion, a concrete walkway making my tender knee's ache with each swaggering step, humid air that burned in my stuffy nose. This is what I imagine vietnam being like. I took a brief rest at one of the neighborhood lemonade stands, they were charging a dollar fore a dixi-cup sized serving, but I suppose i ca n't complain since it is a sellers market; I guess I just would n't expect such cut-throat business models from 8 year old girls. I was about to get a second cup, but their parents were giving me weird looks from the window so I bounced from the scene. I could see my destination in the distance, the place where I had set my legendary lure last night. Let me explain: In pokemon-GO you can buy lures and leave them somewhere, then you come back later and see if it has lured any pokemon there. I had just paid over 1100 $ for the super legendary lure that I had laid here, it was gaurentee'd to attract either an articuno, a zapdos or a moltres; if it attracted a zapdos i was probably going to blow my load in my pants, but even if it was one of the other two i'd get a pretty solid stiffy. I had laid the lure deep inside a random forresty part of town, I wanted to put it in the most remote possible place that is within walking distance from my parents house. I stepped into the forrest and walked another 900 feet before I arrived, the completly random spot I had chosen to place my lure... I guess that means, this is it, it's time... I took a deep breath and then pressed the *search* button on my iphone screen... and waited.. and waited.. usually it did n't take this long... and then.. ***A WILD ZAPDOS APPEARS*** Thick-stickiness ran down my leg but I did n't let it phase me, I maintained mental composure like a true Pokemon-GO champion. First I'd send out my Gyrados as a sacraficial unit to discover Zapdos's attacks... then it happened... across the screen flashed the message: *Wild encouter interrupted, you have been challenged to a poke-battle, do you accept? * \" FUCK!\" I screamed as I hit no, making clear my intention that I did not want to fight in the poke-battle, *Battle accepted, * flashed across my screen. \" NO! WHERE YOU! I'M GOING TO MURDER YOU!\" A handsome man with a dragonlike face and sharp features stepped from the shadow's, \" Here I am,\" he said with a confident grin on his face. Holy. Fuck. It was Lance, the legendary pokemon trainer, original champion of the elite four. With his fierce regime of dragon-type poke-critters he held the title of world's fiercest trainer for over a decade, at which point a mute trainer named blue came out of nowhere and took out his entire roster with nothing but an incredibly powerful charizard and using no techniques other than *fire blast* and *flame thrower. * It had been a real kick in the face to Lance at the time, he disappeared from the public eye and nobody ever heard anything about him unless it was some far out rumour from one of those wacky tabloids, I mean think about it, all his dragons beaten by the one dragon he had decided not to utilize? He must have felt like a real chode. Well he was back now, and from the look in his eye's I think it's safe to say that he's been snorting a little too much rare-candy if you know what I mean, \" Lance!\" I said, bowing my head with respect; even in such aggravating circumstances I knew I must pay homage to those who came before me, \" Sir, with all do respect, I am currently fulfilling my destiny, being the first person to catch a legendary pokemon in Pokemon-Go. Lance's smile faded, it was replaced by a bitter grimace, \" Destiny has grown tired,\" he said slowly, sounding as if he was fading into a two dimensional creature. Suddenly the grin came back.. The man was clearly not stable. \" Dragonite, I choose you!\" He shouted as he clicked his i-phone screen vigoursly, \" Lance! I do n't have time for this!\" I shouted back, knowing that it did n't matter, the man was clearly bonkers. \" If destiny is truly on your side, you will swiftly defeat me and then turn around catch zapdos, making your glory all the higher!\" He had a point. \" Gyrados! I choose you!\" I shouted fiercly; Gyrados had ice-beam, dragonite was weak against ice attacks. \" Dragonite, HYPER BEAM!\" A huge beam of hyper came spitting out of Lancers I-phone into mine, knocking me off my feet, cracking my screen, and worst of all, KOing my gyrados in one hit. I got back to my feet, I was bleeding on my palms, i had scraped them pretty badly when I had fallen from the last. I winced at the pain but then found my safe space, allowing me to maintain mental composure in the face of such insurmountable odds. The air was still heavy and hot, and worse yet was now that I was in the forest the mosquitoes were really beginning to become quite a nuisance, and on top of that my calves itched in a place I could n't reach, I suspected poison ivy. Yet I remained steadfast. I had to give myself credit, I mean really, I had such a Samurai spirit; I was somehow able to maintain an inner stillness in even the most intense circumstances, I must have developed this heroic virtue back in my World of Warcraft raiding days. I had been the main tank for top end guild and oh gosh, actually do n't get me started on this else i'll never stop talking about it. [ continued ]", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Mortals. \" And I thought you wanted to talk?\" \" Let me speak and if you still want to tell me... *that*. I'll listen.\" Thea nodded. She could grant him this small wish. She recalled playing the mortal before. That time she had a wife, kids, and all the goals that \" good\" mortals should seek, but it felt empty. Hollow. \" I love you, Thea. You're so beautiful...\" Why always beautiful? Men are daring, brave, noble, but women are always beautiful. How would he feel to know that she'd been men before? She strained not to let the giggle in her mind show on her face. \" And there's a mystery about you. It draws me in. I feel this need within my soul. A need for us to be together.\" Need. She almost laughed again. This man did not need her for sustenance. Nor for clothing. Nor to continue on in this modern age. He simply had all of his needs met so created more. Never satisfied. Sad as it was, she'd been like that before. If she was honest, she supposed she was like that now. A new experience? How thrilling would that be? \" And I do n't even care that you're an immortal.\" \" What?\" she said, straightening with her attention now rapt. \" What did you just say?\" \" I said, I do n't care that you're an immortal. I'm sure you have scars from your many lives, but I want to be here for you as long as I can.\" Her hands dropped from the railing in her surprise, but her shock quickly faded. \" How do you know that?\" Jon shuffled his feet along the green tinged wood of the dock, almost embarrassed. \" That night, our *first* night, your friend told me.\" \" My... friend?\" She did n't have any friends. Not really and definitely none that knew about her reincarnation. \" Who?\" \" The dark skinned man? I do n't remember his name, we drank a lot, but he said you'd been friends for a long time?\" Who? she thought. Her brow furrowed in confusion and she crossed her arms. Was there someone else like her? Someone who had been reincarnating with her all these years? \" Shit,\" she cursed. Why did she have to get drunk? She looked at Jon who still stared at her, dully in love. \" Listen, Jon, you're sweet, but I have to go see my friend now. You should go get a nice girl. One that's not, um, immortal.\" Jon smirked and she stepped back surprised. His entire posture had changed. His back straightened, standing more confident, and that annoying lovesick look vanished from his eyes. This man was not Jon. \" Who are you?\" she asked, taking a step back. \" Something new,\" he said, \" Something old. But a friend. Did you not enjoy our game?\" \" How? How is this possible?\" she asked. \" Did you think you were alone? That you were truly unique?\" \" Are there others then? Like us?\" \" Of course,\" he said, She shivered, a tingle of excitement running down her spine. *A new experience, * she thought. *After all this time. * \" I want to know more.\" \" Then come with me.\" he asked, holding out his hand. She placed her hand in his, a different feeling than she had nights ago with this man as \" Jon\" the first time. So different. She felt her heart beat pulsing into his palm as they walked down the long dock towards something finally new. Finally. For her, for now, the cycle was broken.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I had planned on telling you about my travels in Europe last summer where I saw the Eiffel Tower and the Sistine Chapel for the first time, living out of my backpack. It might have been a good story. But then, I never counted on you gazing down at me with such beautiful eyes. I don't think I've ever seen eyes as blue as yours, swarming in a cascade of the all the colors in Starry Night. I could fall into them and be devoured as if in a whirlpool. Now I can't remember what I was going to say… No, please don't go! I remember now. It was April, I had just finished my degree in Art History at NYU. The girls in those classes always said I was remarkably sensitive to beauty, and also way too handsome to be single. One girl remarked that I have charming, ruggedly gentle features, like Jake Gyllenhaal. Just trying to set the scene for you. I couldn't study abroad during college, but after four years of reading about Early Renaissance art and studying slides of Athenian sculptures, I knew I had to see the great European cities in person. And I wanted to practice my Italian, perfect the accent ordering gelato. Tu sei quella che stavo aspettando, passerotto mio. If only you hadn't kept me waiting so long. It's not only your eyes that arrest me now. Your chin has a most endearing dimple that only appears when you scoff at my lazy storytelling. I would love to see you laugh, how your face would light up the whole sky. Do you know what Salvador Dali used to eat for breakfast every morning? Big bowl of surreal. Oh, I saw that little smirk before you groaned. It'll be our little secret okay? So I arrived in Madrid, saw the bullfights, went to Guernica for Picasso, watched Flamenco dancers. Such excitement, such life. You would love it there, I know it. Then I was on the train to Paris, through the mountains and across the sea. Oh, Paris. It's just as romantic as I imagined it. You can get caught up in the lights at dusk and just glide through the brick-lain streets, imagine all the lovers who've embraced under each streetlight. The city oozes love from its very ether, mon chere. It can't help it. Love permeates everything. It's all so wonderful and amazing. Oh, ohhh, do that again, my dear. Trace your fingers over my words. They are so soft and tender. Don't stop reading, stay with me. This doesn't have to end. Here, here is the most beautiful thing I have ever read, read it over and over with me, just let's stay here together forever on this page: *\" Our day-to-day life is bombarded with fortuities or, to be more precise, with the accidental meetings of people and events we call coincidences. \" Co-incidence\" means that two events unexpectedly happen at the same time, they meet: Tomas appears in the hotel restaurant at the same time the radio is playing Beethoven. We do not even notice the great majority of such coincidences. If the seat Tomas occupied had been occupied instead by the local butcher, Tereza would never have noticed that the radio was playing Beethoven ( though the meeting of Beethoven and the butcher would also have been an interesting coincidence ). But her nascent love inflamed her sense of beauty, and she would never forget that music. Whenever she heard it, she would be touched. Everything going on around her at that moment would be haloed by the music and take on its beauty. Early in the novel that Tereza clutched under her arm when she went to visit Tomas, Anna meets Vronsky in curious circumstances: they are at the railway station when someone is run over by a train. At the end of the novel, Anna throws herself under a train. This symmetrical composition - the same motif appears at the beginning and at the end - may seem quite \" novelistic\" to you, and I am willing to agree, but only on condition that you refrain from reading such notions as \" fictive,\" \" fabricated,\" and \" untrue to life\" into the word \" novelistic.\" Because human lives are composed in precisely such a fashion. They are composed like music. Guided by his sense of beauty, an individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence ( Beethoven's music, death under a train ) into a motif, which then assumes a permanent place in the composition of the individual's life. Anna could have chosen another way to take her life. But the motif of death and the railway station, unforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark beauty. Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress. It is wrong, then, to chide the novel for being fascinated by mysterious coincidences ( like the meeting of Anna, Vronsky, the railway station, and death or the meeting of Beethoven, Tomas, Tereza, and the cognac ), but it is right to chide man for being blind to such coincidences in his daily life. For he thereby deprives his life of a dimension of beauty. \" * When has this ever been truer than it is now? How unlikely that you should pick up this particular book and turn to my story, among the dozens of others and the millions of books? What can I do, now that I have met you? My life can never be the same. It is just as he says, it will always be more beautiful, more luminous and textured. How could I have wanted anything more? To be with you here now, I feel all I could ever want to feel. Let me tell you what happened next on my journey. This is when the story gets good, you see. There's a twist, you'll need to stick around to find out what happens. So I navigate Paris, from the Arc d'Triomphe to Notre Dame ( not that I was only going to the popular places, of course – locals pointed me to some very secret hideaways ), and then I took the train to Florence. We crossed through the mountains, still draped in snow mid-June. While barreling through one particularly long and dark tunnel, I heard an earthquake-like rumble, except above us. The opening of the underpass shone brightly up ahead, only moments later to be our window to the avalanche bellowing above us. The conductor blazed ahead, blasting through the snowpiles like a bullet through tissue paper. But the snow kept crashing down, and the train began to slow as cars behind us were buried deeper and deeper in wet, muddy ice. Suddenly the overhead lights began to flicker, then went out completely. We lurched to a reluctant stop. The conductor made a cursory announcement about temporary delays, then let out a heavy sigh over the intercom before remembering to turn off the mic. Does this sound too unbelievable? Well, believe it. Strange and exciting things happen every day you know. Train accidents are the least of it. How did I survive you ask? Amidst a thundering snowslide hundreds of miles from any assistance? Keep reading, my love, I feel you grasp the pages more tightly in your anticipation and it gives me a thrill like nothing else. You will not be disappointed. We waited eleven hours on that stretch of track, the cold creeping into our compartments despite burying ourselves under blankets almost as deeply as the caboose became buried under debris. Waitresses brought hors d'oeuvres and drinks around periodically and only one man went a little crazy, tried to jump out into the field and run for the nearest village. They caught him first and knocked him out. While half-slumbering in my seat, my cabin-mate began telling stories about his travels in the far east—India, Japan, Thailand, Turkey. I felt warm just imagining all the spices in their foods, let alone the sweltering summer monsoons. He might have saved my life that way. Words can do a lot, you know. They can be just alive as you are. We were finally rescued by a team of soldiers on – you'll never believe it—elephants! They took a page out of Hannibal's book I suppose. We rode on elephant-back to Milan, and there I had the most delicious fettuccini I will likely ever experience. Next was on to Florence and finally Venice. Venice, the floating, sinking, city amidst glorious ancient buildings. Venice is a magical place, almost as romantic as Paris, I think. If I could take you anywhere in the world, we would go to Venice first, then Paris, to experience the flood of first flirtation blossoming into the overwhelming desire of real love. That's my story, my dear. I think there were other details I meant to include, maybe some other characters somewhere, but with you up there, who else do I really need in this world. You and I together, that's all I ever want or need. How can we be together, you say? My story ends just at the bottom of this page, then you will turn it over, and I will be gone. Oh, I know we are in a library, and you could come back each day to read me, but I don't want to be so far from you ever again. Just take me in your bag and carry me away with you so that we might spend every day together, any time at all. You would never do such a thing as steal library books, I know, you are too good and pure, but I don't want anyone else to read my words again. I can't go back to the darkness between these worn covers unless I know that you are clutching them close to your chest. Please, I beg of you, just stay a little longer. Just a little longer. A little bit longer more. Three words more.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He any anyone curious about the lives of our fore-fathers of the Latest Dark Ages will be thrilled to examine this chalice, as it is one of only half-a-dozen that we have recovered, due to the biodegradable nature of their materials. Remarkably, this chalice was found by the heirs of the late Francis Smith. It had been stored in - and subsequently forgotten - in a sterile environment that had been walled off centuries ago.

It's a bit past noon, so ordinarily it would be time for my second daily dose of amphetamines. The orderlies hear the PA chime and each grab a pill bottle of out their pockets in perfect concert. The shaking of the bottles echo down the hall above our footsteps. Above all other sounds, I always hear the rattle. By state law, I am allowed a lunch, which is always afforded to people who are too sick to take the amphetamines. I wo n't be eating dinner, so it will actually be quite substantial. The orderlies set me down in a chair in Dr. Minnas's office. He is out. Before me is a clean, black table supporting a hefty ham sandwich, two peeled carrots and a few ounces of water in a glass cup.

I took the amphetamine. The effects are instantaneous. I drink the water, and bludgeon the orderly to death with the heavy glass cup. A minute passes, and his counterpart returns. I stab him in the neck with a shard of that same cup, and patiently wait for the Minnas as I finish my sandwich.

No one should be allowed to spend all day writing silly lies and funny songs when the rest of us have work to do.\" Minnas produces a syringe.

As some of you know, I've been Traveling for about a decade now, and I've gotten the opportunity to see and experience a lot of worlds -- or dimensions -- just like our own. But first, let me give you a little bit of a background first. We'll just hit the bullet-points. Yes, I can travel between dimensions. No, I do n't know how it works. No, no one else seems to know either, but there are several good theories. I can only travel for about 48-hours at a time. I've visited a little over 200 different dimensions.

We need you -- we need engineers. We need to find out one, how I am able to Travel across these dimensions, and two, how we can get others to do the same. Why is this important? Let's forget about the philosophical or scientific implications for just one moment. There's one really important reason why we need to be able to Travel to other dimensions. Are you ready? Here it comes: Our dimension sucks. I know, you think that I'm making a joke here, but I'm not.

A very high approval rating! # 207: Africa is less ravaged by war and disease. # 206: Animals we often categorize as cryptozoological exist: bigfoot, Nessie, the jackalope. # 205: The Atlanta Braves had a really excellent 2016 year in baseball. # 204: People seem to be immune to the effects of fascism. # 203: Flatulence smells like fresh grass clippings. # 202: Dogs can talk! # 201: Time travel was discovered and used for charitable purposes. # 200: This was another one where people were just marginally more attractive. # 199: Human memory is no longer subject to failure. People remember everything. # 198: In most parts of the world, the temperature never gets over 90 degrees. # 197: The world is slightly smaller, so there's a little less gravity. # 196: No tornadoes or hurricanes! # 195: Frivolous lawsuits are n't a thing. # 194: I have kids. There's probably more to the dimension than just the fact that I have kids, but to be completely honest with you, I did n't see much of the world. I stayed inside and got to know them for the 48-hours that I could share with them. # 193: Atlantis is a global superpower. # 192: The moon landing resulted in the first moon town, and by 2016, we've already colonized both Mars and our moon. # 191: Television's The Learning Channel lived up to its name. # 190: Only bullies get cavities.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "God becomes unsatisfied with the idea that they have simply \" always existed \", and begins the search for their creator.", "output": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The world was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and His spirit was hovering over the waters. Some would have you believe that God's next action was to say \" Let there be light,\" and that there would, in response, be light. While this is technically true, it ignores the brief moment of uncertainty experienced by the Creator, during which He contemplated precisely how He had known what \" light\" actually was. Omniscience was all well and good, but it lacked a certain nuance that God associated with the feeling of objective truth... and of course, \" objective truth\" was only too easy to define, given that God was omniscient. It was enough to give any being a headache. From the perspective of the many creatures that God called into existence, the world began in an enormous expansion of energy. This eventually slowed and coalesced into the first proto-particles, with some of them becoming stable and giving rise to tiny specks of matter. Time began at some point along the line - forever frustrating those individuals who naively asked what had come \" before\" the universe - and after eons, stars and planets formed, giving life a perfect stage on which to rise up, regard its fellow beings, and promptly attempt to obliterate them. God's perspective, on the other hand, was much simpler. The whole of His creative efforts could be said to have passed in an instant, at which point He began to sulk. He was, as He had already covered, entirely all-knowing. Logically speaking, therefore, He knew His own origins. Therein lied the problem, however, for though He was aware of having infinitely existed, even infinity has to start *somewhere*, and all signs pointed to it having started with God. It was the grandest and most divine of circular arguments. It was also, on one of God's life-bearing planets, the basis for a peculiar religious sect, in which practitioners attempted to answer any question voiced to them with nothing more than \" Because!\" ( The topic of what to eat for lunch was particularly irksome. ) It eventually - or immediately, depending on your point of view - occurred to God that His omniscience was strangely lacking. This paradoxical inability to answer an inquiry asked of Himself seemed to indicate that rules and realms existed beyond His perception... or at the very least, that He was a master at confusing Himself. Either way, God's course of action seemed clear, if only to Him: He would, in his infinite power, destroy Himself, thus discovering where His existence would *end*. After all, infinity had to start somewhere, but nobody had ever stipulated in which direction it needed to travel. The answer was a satisfying one, even if nobody would ever know it. Perhaps appropriately, those same naive fools who ask \" What came *before* the universe?\" are much closer to the truth than anyone would imagine. They have simply yet to realize that the universe is running in reverse.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I had lain in a scarred cornfield at the end of harvest in a pair of blue dungarees and no shoes because my parents could only afford one pair that year and I'd had to keep them smart for school. I had two long stems of corn in my hands. One was mommy and one was daddy and they were talking about having a baby ear of corn to love and look after. They could n't, because they could n't afford a baby, but they were talking about it anyway. *What are you playing? * The voice, like a whisper over a lake, was rich and strong. It reminded me of bitter coffee, though that realisation would come later. I was overjoyed. I had a friend that was completely my own. You do n't get many things that are completely your own when you have seven brothers and sisters crammed into a five room house. I can keep it under control, now. There was a dark patch in my teens where I was n't really coping. I do n't want to talk about it, even now that so much time has passed. My mother went hungry to pay for the medication I needed. There's nothing like the guilt you get when you make someone else ill in order for you to feel better. I'm deciding between roses and carnations. It's half two, and I'm meeting Daisy for dinner. There's a florist's boutique not far from my office in downtown Chicago, with green umbrellas outside open over black tubs of blooming flowers. Inside it's a riotous mass of colour, every shelf and surface covered in streaming green running to purple, red, white, yellow. It's almost dark, the huge window displays blocking out any sunlight that could make its way indoors on this murky grey Illinois day. \" Hello?\" I call out, making my way past a low table overspilling with a trailing white flower, a pair of secateurs nestled deep in the foliage. \" Is anyone there?\" I pull the business card out of my wallet, check it again, to make sure I'm in the right place. *Flowers and bouquets for all occasions* It reads, careful looping script over a translucent rose. \" Hello?\" I call again. Now I'm in front of yellow sunflowers. The smell is almost overwhelming. A dark haired woman stands from amongst a wave of blue dahlias, like Botticelli's Venus rising from blue and white waves. She almost looks as though angels could be welcoming her home as she stands serene among the madness of flowers and smiles at me. She has a sheaf of corn in her hands, a white poppy tucked in the darks cadence of her hair. She's wearing a simple white dress, bare of accessories except those flowers around her. \" Hello,\" she says softly, voice like coffee and it's like I've been punched in the chest. I ca n't speak for a moment, the surprise and nostalgia almost too strong to bear. \" Are you looking for flowers?\" She asks and I nod dumbly. \" Daisies?\" One eyebrow lifts. \" You're holding corn.\" I say, voice strangled. \" I like corn. I have a particular affinity with corn.\" She laughs. \" Farmer's daughter. I'm sure you understand.\" \" I want roses, please.\" Her face drops slightly. \" Roses? But how- never mind. Roses it shall be. Roses for Daisy!\" While she wraps the bouquet, deft hands moving over the falling blooms I fumble in my pocket, screw open the orange tub and swallow two pills, dry. I'm not supposed to take them like this and it hurts, spots forming in front of my vision. But she's still there when I look up. \" What'll that be?\" I ask Her eyes flash at me in a golden smile. \" Just your number. I'd like to talk corn with you.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

So the second loss was n't a few minutes ago - the rest is accurate. Yet - I will attempt to write it again. It is n't quite the same, and I regret that - but I will try. Lust is one of my favourite characters. Here goes... > I do n't hate this form. It is quite beautiful. I understand the feelings it evokes in those besotted my me. But it pales in comparison to the bloodlust I feel. > Hundreds, even thousands have I cut to pieces. But it mattered little. > A swift swipe, and my adversary cut to ribbons. Subtle in its treachery, and beautiful all the same. A fatal act, the finality of which I hoped would evoke in me some kind of emotion. > Yet the bloodlust remained. Waiting to be sated. All those I faced either defenseless and unable to fight, or cowardly and unwilling to. Spineless shells, a shame to call sentient. > HOW? How could such an act not get the slightest rise out of me? Not satisfy me in the slightest? > But tonight was different - I could feel it. Humans are truly exceptional creatures. > Havoc; outwardly a buffon but a man of honour and spine. Even in his pursuit of me let up not a single detail of his work. A lesser man would n't last half as long. When I saw him - my heart almost sank. But it was far outpaced by the excitement I felt. > Would these two men finally satisfy me. I felt my core exploding. > To see the flame alchemist next to him - the hero of Ishval - my heart leapt with joy. > Even as he shot me without hesitation to try to get me down on my knees - I thought I could get the better of him, but I was wrong. > Even sliced and doused him to neuter his flames - he managed to get the better of me. Tearing apart with the very substance I thought would render him ineffectual - water - to ignite its components - hydrogen and oxygen - and sear my flesh. Who would have thought that my first death that night would be due to such exceptional circumstances. > Even as I baked I looked forward to rending him. To regenerate and look deep into his eyes and see his flame fading. The very flames that were the core of his being. The flames that burnt to the ground an entire country. And then point to his dying comrade - and point out his helplessness to stop it. > But that was not yet to be. Even as I regenerated and stabbed his subordinate - [ the flame alchemist plunged his hand into my very core to heal his subordinate ] ( http: //i.imgur.com/EU2HNdch.png ). There lay the philosopher's stone - the secret to eternal life. > If I was a lesser being - this would have been the end of me. I had already died twice, but I was a homunculus. Reforming around my core, I was finally able to look into his eyes - stabbing him in his side and point out his helplessness. He would have to watch his subordinate bleed to death and leave me to the eye of the hawk. Stabbed and his alchemic gloves torn to shreds - he was helpless. Another beloved underling was going to die under his watch. The eye of the hawk. > I was really looking forward to it. The eye of the hawk - without the slightest hint of the alchemic abilities that made alchemists into weapons, not averting her eyes from her actions, and singularly focussed on the crosshairs on her scope - she littered the battlefield with bodies. > To reduce her to a corpse would be exquisite. > But even this was not a luxury about to be afforded to me. > Even as I caught up to her and informed her of the presumed demise of her beloved Mustang, Hawkeye missed not a single shot. Driving into me bullet after bullet. Her aim was unerring. Even in the midst of crippling grief she found her mark.

How could he-\" \" We're his first real command. He does n't have the same instincts that Ryan had.\" Captain Jennings said sharply. A wave of reverential silence passes through the assembled toy soldiers at the mention of the older brothers name. Ryan had guided them through many battles. The Army Men had been recently passed down to his younger brother, Leo. The young boy had come inside without remembering to pick up the expeditionary unit he had deemed fit to deploy to the Dunes. Captain Jennings waved Lieutenant Smith over to the window, away from the rest of the troops. He holstered his pistol and brought his binoculars to his face. The troops gained a lot of freedom once away from human eyes. \" We need to go after them.\" He said grimly. \" You remember the forest in'97 as well as I do. That's a suicide op sir.\" Smith pressed a palm against the glass. \" That was different. The odds of a raccoon getting over that fence are astronomical. I... we have to try, Joe.\" Jennings helmet still bore deep gouges from that particular encounter. \" I'll go tell the troops then.\" Smith said stiffly. He climbed down from the window sill and approached the assembled soldiers. An entire barrel, green and tan assembled before him. It was a historic day. A cease fire had been called for humanitarian purposes. \" As of twenty one hundred hours this evening, a unit of Green infantry men were abandoned in the Dunes. We are trying to establish radio contact but no luck so far. I need volunteers for a rescue operation.\" A sea of hands shot up. \" One. Two. Everyone, alright.\" Smith clapped his hands together seriously. \" Gear up and meet back here in five. I need the Tan CO to meet with the Green command staff on the window sill.\" He walked towards the Lego brick staircase that Green Army engineers had built up to the window sill. A harried looking Tan officer began walking next to him. \" I'm Captain Silva.\" Smith was startled to hear a womans voice. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead as he briskly walked. \" You're new.\" He said. It was n't a question. \" Birthday gift this year. We were in the package he opened right after yours.\" She said almost apologetically. Smith nodded curtly to a guard as he mounted the stairs. \" We appreciate the Tan help we're getting. You ever been outside?\" \" No. I mostly worked logistics during the fighting. Captain Martin got vacuumed last month so I'm a fairly recent promotion.\" Silva said, a step behind him. \" Take an old soldiers advice, stay here. Run the comms, prepare triage. This is not an experience you want.\" \" With all do respect Lieutenant, I'm going to be out there with my soldiers. Same as you.\" Captain Jennings was speaking very intently with a Green tank commander. \" Armor will be ready to roll. We're fueling now. Some of my boys raised some concern about going down the stairs though. Gon na be costly timewise.\" The commander drawled in a thick New Orleans accent. \" We're not going down the stairs.\" Jennings said. \" We're getting a bit of help from the builders.\" He nodded towards the far edge of the window sill, where a team of Lego mini figures and both Green and Tan engineers were working frantically to erect what looked like a massive winch.. \" Gon na drop us right into the yard.\" He said. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The Dunes were a harsh environment during the day. At night they turned into a forsaken wasteland that even the humans avoided. \" That spider probed the defenses again. It's getting bolder.\" Corporal Jameson wiped a streak of grime off of his dull green face. \" We drove it off?\" Sergeant Foley was looking for any sort of good news. He was sitting on an upturned ammo crate inside the expeditionary units makeshift shelter. \" Barely.\" Jameson said grimly. \" Flamethrower is just about out of ammo.\" The beleaguered Green unit had dragged several plastic barricades into a makeshift perimeter. Inside of that they dug a foxhole and built a crude shelter of bark and rocks. Foley got up and began making the rounds to check on his men. Several wounded were laying near a small fire at the back of the shelter. Private Wells, the medic, was frantically trying to patch up a soldier with a severed arm. \" Can we do anything for Rawlings?\" Sergeant Foley made his way back to the makeshift infirmary. \" Without a hot glue gun or some tape? Not much.\" Wells ushered him away from the injured man. \" That's not something I can just slap a bandage on Sarge.\" \" See what you can do for the pain.\" Foley clapped the younger man on the shoulder. Private Abrams, the radio operator slapped his radio and stood up from his trademark crouch. \" Got a signal Sarge. Ca n't clean it up.\" \" Let me hear what you've got.\" Foley said. Abrams nodded, visibly forcing himself to calm down. He adjusted a dial and held up the headset for the grizzled NCO. \".......expect....escue.....Alpha Four Zero.....\" The message was garbled, but the expeditionary units radio call sign was clear. \" It's been repeating for the last hour.\" Abrams said. As the radio operator spoke, another message came through. This was forcefully clear against the static. \" Survive. Help is coming.\" It was clearly Captain Jennings. \" They're coming for us. Help is on the way.\" Foley handed back the headset with a determined nod. \" At night?\" The surprise in Abrams voice was evident. \" Cap would n't just abandon us. He did n't leave anyone in the forest and he's not going to leave us here.\" Foley said firmly. The sharp chatter of automatic weapons fire cut off Abrams response. \" Movement on the perimeter!\" Jameson shouted. One of the MG emplacements opened up again, muzzle flash cutting through the night. Foley snatched up his M16 and sprinted across the sand towards the emplacement. The machine gunner, Private Ellison was staring, wide eyed into the night. \" Was n't the spider sir. This was bigger. There was fur.\" He straightened out his ammo belt and tried to calm his breathing. \" Let's not take any chances. Pull back. Set up closer to the shelter.\" Foley said. A scream from another part of the perimeter indicated the beasts return. He saw the muzzle flashes illuminate the creature rearing up on its hindquarters. He dropped into a crouch and started firing at it. Private Ramirez screamed as he was dragged out into the night. A burst from Ellison's machine gun finally sending the beast retreating into the dark. \" C'mon.\" Foley motioned to the gunner. The man was frozen to his spot, staring into the night that had taken his friend. \" Let's move private. Shift it.\" Foley forcibly hauled Ellison to his feet. The other soldier hefted his machine gun and threw his ammo bag over one shoulder. He nodded spasmodically. They headed back for the shelter and prepared to batten down for a hell of a night. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Check out /r/HeyThereGorgeous for more stuff I've written!", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

She made her way to the elevator, turning the keycard between her fingers. She didn't want to use it. But it had probably cost her upwards of 100 marks, and she would be stupid to throw that kind of money away. The elevator opened. Elliot stepped in and hovered her finger over the floor buttons. Maybe the booth wasn't such a bad thing. If nothing else, she could at least try to put into words what had happened. Practice explaining in case she figured out who the right person to talk to was. She pushed the button for the fourth floor. The AI booth was clean, which was a first. She'd never used a city booth before, only the cheap ones in bars and smoke houses, which probably explained it. Elliot swiped her card and the booth whirred to life. The faint sounds of pots and pans clanking in a sink began, slowly rising in volume. \" Elliot! \" A feminine voice called in the dark. *Too high*, Elliot thought. Too high to be her mother's voice. She heard the booth click, like a shutter on an old fashioned camera as it made the adjustment. \" What are you doing home? \" *Better*. \" I need you to tell me something. \" The clanking stopped and Elliot's brain filled in the silence: her mother would be wiping her soapy hands on a dishtowel, turning her wedding ring that always seemed to slip around and face her palm whenever she washed the dished. \" Of course. \" \" If somebody touches me… \" \" Ah. \" The AI sounded knowing. \" The Sex Talk. \" \" No. \" \" If someone touches you, Elliot, that's called— \" \" No, I *know* what it's called! That's not it—\" Elliot's heart rose in her throat. She hated the feeling. The second time in two days it had happened. \" You have to *want* it. \" \" Yes. There's no other way. \" Anger unfurled in the pit of Elliot's stomach. \" But I *didn't* want him to touch me. So what is that? What is *that* called? \" \" Oh, Elliot. \" He mother's voice was sympathetic. \" Of course you did. \" \" I didn't. \" \" You must have. \" \" I *didn't*. \" \" If you didn't, it wouldn't have happened. \" It was so blank, so matter-of-fact. If this, then this. No deviation allowed. It was the same argument she'd been having with herself. It did n't happen unless you said so, but she had n't said so. She had to have done something, then, to say yes, but she had n't. It should n't have happened, but it had, and suddenly the booth was too small, the darkness oppressive and suffocating. The AI was washing dishes again, the conversation over, and Elliot fumbled in the dark for the booth's ejection button. The sound proof seal gave way with a hiss, and Elliot stumbled out, into the light. Her heart was pounding and she was breathing hard. \" I didn't, \" she said between gasps. \" I didn't. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Now the humming of the gravity-cancelling engine had faded away. Darren had been holding his breath and with a gasping release, he was finally able to move again. He popped up, and before his companions even sat up, he turned the key with force. The engine turned over miraculously, it was such a forbidden and beautiful sound, and he felt his spirits lift as if he could change the world. It affected his companions as well, Charlene squealed and hugged him, forgetting the danger from a moment ago. Robert looked embarrassed, probably upset with Darren taking the lead. For some reason, the lights were on in the car. \" Hang on kids! \" He surged right out into the debris laden roadway and put the pedal down, quickly changing gears and speeding up. The red roadster positively revved and roared down the pavement. Even few blocks he hit a bump or crack that shook the entire car. Broken down cars, common and obsolete as to be ignored by survivors were whipped by, and still Darren pushed faster. \" Slow down! \" screamed a sheet-white Robert. Meanwhile Charlene was holding onto him, gripping. Darren had to resist the urge to shake her off. \" There is no slowing down! \" Grinning, Darren could only focus in front of them. They would be tailed by a death dealing robot, pretty soon probably. This is it, either they got out onto the road alive, leaving this deathtrap behind, or they blasted to death in this fine, fine vehicle. What a way to go. An explosive concussion rocked them from behind, the tires squealing for a slit second. His companions screamed, but the only thoughts Darren had were on maneuvering and going FASTER. There were more shots, all falling just barely short and rocking the car. The stupid machines focused and stopped before firing. Still the shots were so close, they couldn't get away unless they went faster. Darren had to maneuver around road blocking obstacles, while the drones floated above. \" Do something Goddamnit! \" Robert cried. Darren swerved as another four star drone dropped out from one of the buildings setting its laser eye on the roadster. The car blitzed under the drone, but not far enough. Its bottom spike slashed the windshield, somehow tearing it off. Luckily Charlene and Robert ducked, and although Darren was clipped in the head he shook it off. He hardly felt it. The drone must've had to turn around; blocking others, to keep in pursuit. Darren risked a glance a tri-force of killer robots was heading after them directly. He nearly drove them into a wall but just managed to regain control and keep going. Charlene was pushing his head for some reason, he might be bleeding. The way out of the city was in sight, there was a steep drop off of a large overpass and then the open-road if he could out speed the drones. \" Keep going. Keep going. \" He repeated these words to himself. Spears of energy criss-crossed, cutting the road, just behind the speeding car, exploding blacktop and concrete. A third drone was speeding up, not firing, trying to get in line with the car. In the next hit second the drone tried to crash into them, however its bottom spike cut into the road, with ear rending scrape it broke and crashed into the road skidding and with a huge release of energy exploded in a failed kamikaze strike. The two other drones were caught in the blast, thrown back and disabled, falling apart, adding to the debris on the edge of the city. Darren couldn't look, he was going too fast. The road dropped down, and the car took flight in the air. All three of them were screaming, and with a sudden bounce they hit the bottom of the drop, peeling sideways into a black rubber marked spiral. The car finally stopped, Darren couldn't feel his body, but he was shaking so bad. His foot was off the pedal somehow. He passed out and his head hit the horn. It made a klaxon noise as his friends struggled to help him.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Staying in school until late at night, lots of textbooks, here, there - books, books everywhere! And for what, now that I've failed?\" I took a math textbook on the floor. Rifling through the pages, I showed my mum the notes that covered every square inch of the book in black ink. \" You see?\" I said. \" All of it, all of that sine a over a bullshit - useless! It's all gone now, and you want me to do the whole thing all over again?\" \" Please do n't talk to your mother like that,\" she said. \" Who do you think you are?

I do n't want to do this test anymore.\" She looked at me with sad eyes. Once, I knew, they had been big and black, and like warm soup on a cold winter's night - now they just looked black. \" It will be such a shame,\" she said. \" Do n't you understand?

All I ever did, I did to make you proud. So tell me how proud you are, Mom. TELL ME!\" She flinched a little. Off to one corner I saw her hand jerk back. But I was n't finished. \" Tell me! Tell me how proud you are of me, when my friend committed suicide and I had to console her parents! Tell me how proud you are, when I got lost in the city, and I had to find my own way back, and how all you ever said was that I was embarrassing, *disappointing*, for having gotten lost! TELL ME!\" She remained silent. The white of the walls reflected off her pale cheeks. \" You ca n't say anything?\" I asked, tears in my eyes. \" You ca n't even bring yourself to tell it to your only son? Tell me you love me, then, Ma. Tell me you love me.\" \" You are disloyal,\" she said, the colour returning to her face. \" This is disrespectful. I know you are tired, but please, don't-\" \" I'm done,\" I said, pushing past her. \" You ca n't even say it, Mom. And you know what? I ca n't say it, either. And I'm sorry I ca n't say it.

I could feel the dampness of my socks and sighed inwardly, *Another pair of socks ruined. * Looking down at my clothes did n't make me any more encouraged. I was covered in blood, rom my gloved hands up past my elbows, all over my midsection and from my knees down. Soaked. In front of me, sprawled out and chest exposed lay Private First Class Something-Or-Other. It's not that I did n't want to remember his name. When I had first arrived in this dusty and dry country I remembered the name of every person I touched, but now... too many had passed before me. Too many dead. Too many tattered bodies. Too many being sent home incomplete and missing parts. I had become numb to what now seemed like constant loss. I reached out one red covered hand, lifting his dog tags. *PFC Jonathan Murphie* The gaping hole in his left side still oozed blood onto the floor. I had n't been able to do anything. Parts of his colon and ileum had been completely ripped away, but he had been conscious upon arrival so I had gotten to work. *Christ, I probably caused this poor kid more pain in the end... * I let out a weighted sigh and began pulling off my gloves. My PA, Lt. Hughs, was waiting quietly by the tent flap, a jug of sterile water in his hands. He was just as tired as I was, but his arms and neck were clean - *When did he find time for that? * - and he had already found a clean shirt. He poured the water slowly over my arms as I scrubbed away my guilt over the young private's death. \" He was already dead when he got here, Doc.\" I glance back at the still form behind us, \" Yeah, I know...\" Hughs nodded, his brows drawing down in concern, \" Yeah, I know...\" I splash the cool water on my face, washing away the sticky sweat then quickly move through the tent flap and into the bright sunlight. Looks of shock from soldiers new to the camp and those of pity from the old dogs follow me as I navigate my way to the women's barracks. A quick shower and a new set of clothes - *Honestly, how many clothes have I gone through since I got here? * - and I started to feel... something again. The sun and the heat helps. Coming from Texas, I had always enjoyed the feel of the hot sun on my face. I headed to the main medical hospital, *What I would n't give for the military to build a Starbucks in Jalalabad! * This was my home away from home, the hospital buzzed as nurses and techs went from bed to bed caring for patients, and doctors sat in front of computers, filling our charts, chatting, discussing patients. This was as close to normal as we would come on this side of the world. At the nurses station I pick up my charts, covering a yawn. Nurse Muriel smiles sympathetically, \" I heard about your table death. I'm sorry, Dr. Spero.\" I nod, barely hearing her. She pulls a chart from my pile, \" PSC Roman said he wants to see you, that it's important.\" I glance at the chart, \" The diaphragm perf and partial ileum resection? Did he say why?\" Concern suddenly flooded my groggy brain. PSC Roman's surgery 2 days ago had not been easy, and his recovery slow. He had only just become stable last night, his stats creeping closer to normal. \" He did n't say, just that he had to see you.\" The nurse shrugged, unsure. Outside PSC Roman's room i quickly gave myself a mental shake. *He's been dead less than an hour. * 6 hours of surgery did not excuse any mistakes I made while on duty. *Look after the living. * I work on my smile then enter the small ICU room. \" Roman! It's great to see you awake, man.\" The lanky youth sitting in the bed grinned, his blue eyes sparkling. \" Aw, Doc. No Tali bastard is going to get rid of me as easy as that.\" A laptop sat on his lap, the screen glowing. He looked a little pale, but other than that he looked... well, healthy. I knew better. I raised an eyebrow, \" They came close.\" He had been touch and go for nearly 40 hours, and even now there was the possibility of a sudden down turn. \" But your stats look great. You're stable now, I think we will get you flown out to Germany later today if we can. Sound good?\" If things did go sideways, they were better equipped to deal with it in Germany. \" Actually, you have perfect timing, Doc. Come here, I want to show you something.\" His grin widened as he motioned me forward to look at his computer. As I approached his bed he hit the volume button, and a little giggle splashes out across the room. \" Say hello, Abby!\" Roman waves at the screen. There, waving her chubby little arms in a bright blue dress that matched her and her fathers eyes was a little cherubic girl squirming in her mothers lap. The woman waved the girls arm for her, \" Hello, Dr. Spero!\" I waved back, smiling as Abby shrieked with laughter. Roman laughs too, \" She just passed 6 months.\" \" She's such a happy baby.\" Abby continued to bounce around. Roman nodded, \" She has reason. She'll get to see me in about a month.\" He smiled like a foolish schoolboy. A lump caught in my throat, \" Right, well, I will see about getting you out of here soon then. Bye, Abby!\" I waved quickly to the chubby child and all but rushed out of the room. I ran for the bathroom, leaning against the locked door. As my eyes watered I pulled out the worn, laminated picture I always kept in my pocket, and caressed the faces smiling back at me: My husband in his own military uniform with our youngest son in his arms and our oldest boy smiling at his hip. In the corner, my husband had written \" I love you, hon\". I kissed the photo, *I love you, too.

Dave laughs at my over-dramatic scenario, \" Maybe Zack will create some in a lab when he becomes the world's greatest scientist \" he hypothesizes. I laugh and ask about Travis. Dave bursts into laughter; Travis was our oddball freelancer. He was either going to be an author, artist, actor, singer, or a musician. At that moment, Travis walks into the kitchen and opens the fridge, \" I'm hungry \" he whines pulling random foods out of the fridge. He pulls out chocolate syrup, pickles, bread, and Sriracha hot sauce. My stomach turns and I raise my voice, \" I swear Travis that if any of that goes together on a sandwich, I will lock the fridge! \" Dave tries to hide his smile unsuccessfully, \" You are disgusting \" he tells Travis as he continues to pull out more things from the fridge. Travis rolls his eyes, \" I'm not putting this all on one sandwich \" he says in an annoyed tone. I'm about to yell when I hear Sandy scream. Dave and I leave Travis to his own devices, and run to rescue our youngest princess. Her usually happy smile is warped into a frightened expression. \" By the window! \" She screeches as I hug her. Dave pulls her pink curtains back and then we see it. There is a bumblebee buzzing around the room. Dave smiles in astonishment and his eyes widen. He looks at me and sees the same amazement on my face as Sandra continues to cry in fear. Dave and I watch it fly and then he says, \" It's a bee Sandy. It's a real bumblebee. \" As I watch it fly, memories of warm summer days flood my mind.

I remember swinging with all my might and making contact with the intruders head. I remember the sound of the metal bouncing off the trespasser's head and the thump on the ground shortly after. The rest is a blur. I stood there alone, surrounded by darkness, until sunrise. The sun's damp light pierced through my living room window, allowing me to get an actual view of my victim. I realized the horrid deed I had committed. My beautiful wife's lifeless body was laying in the middle of my house. My mind was racing. We had a fight that night, a bad one in a string of brawls that had plagued our marriage over the recent months. She was going to spend the night at her parent's house. I had considered divorce, but I had too much to lose. After I processed what I had done, a morbid sense of relief temporarily overtook me. I was free. No giving up the house, no splitting time with our child, no expensive divorce lawyers, no admitting to my family and friends my marriage was a failure, nothing. I was free. I took great care cleaning her blood off the brown wooden floor, making sure to avoid contact with her lifeless body. As I finished cleaning the last small puddle of blood I made eye contact with my wife's corpse. Her green emeralds were still full of life, bringing me back to the beautiful moments we had together. Relaxing at our beach house, hunting with her dad, and waking up before her in the morning and staring down at her beautiful face. At one point we shared such an intense love that it hurt. \" We can work this out \" I thought, \" I should press my button. \" Then I remembered the cold reality that those times were over and this was best. I left my wife on the floor and went upstairs to grab a shovel and my 8 month old daughter for our ride to the forest. I was welcomed to my daughter's room with the beautiful sound of infant cooing. I looked down at my daughter's face and knew I had to press the button. I looked at my daughters face and saw my wife. My wife was a part of my daughter, and I couldn't kill a part of my daughter. I couldn't let my daughter live her life without a mother. I walked into my room, opened the walk-in closet, and pressed the redo button.

You can overhear some of the genies griping about wishes they've had to fulfill.", "output": "\"'Make me a millionaire', he says.'I wish to be filthy rich!', he says.\" I watched as the man with the curled beard and sunken eyes glared angrily into his drink, whisps of smoke and a faltering flicker of flame peeking from the rim. How he could drink something that appeared to be on fire, I had no idea. I think I heard his friends at the table call him Al... something. The other patrons sitting at the table around Al laughed mirthlessly. \" What did this genius amongst Men do with the million dollars you gifted him, Al-Shazhin?\" asked a large man with a wry mischief in his smile. His dark skin was speckled with glitter, or at least I figured it had to be glitter. But it looked like stars and nebulas. \" He spent it on fancy cars and a big house, of course!\" the Stardust man laughed uproariously. The third man at the table, a slim-framed young crossdresser with green bodypaint covering his skin ( but it looked so natural, as if he was n't wearing paint at all ) looked like he was doing some quick mental calculations. \" House and a car, bought outright? How much of the million did he set aside for home maintenance and utilities, or for car repairs?\" \" None at all! The costs of maintaining such a home ruined him financially!\" Al flung his arms into the air in disbelief as Stardust and Green-Boy laughed. \" And whom did he blame, friend, for these new woes his money had brought upon him?\" Stardust inquired eagerly. Al spoke in a high-pitched mocking voice, \" Oh no, you evil monster genie, how could you do this to me, you tricked me, whaaaa boo hoo hoo!\" The three men all laughed loudly as if at an in-joke. Such a strange topic of conversation. It struck me as curious that they would discuss casually giving someone a million dollars so openly. Most bars I went to, that kind of talk gets you mugged. And what was that \" genie\" bit about? Green-Boy chugged down a sip of his drink, heedless of the layer of ice growing on the outside of the glass. \" Either of you ever grant a wish for love?\" Al and Stardust recoiled in mock horror, hands raised in mock self-defense. \" Ooooh noo, never! I do n't touch that stuff.\" Al said. \" Agreed!\" Stardust boomed. \" Love, Death, and Resurrection, three wishes I never grant. They only cause trouble.\" \" Well I granted some guy a wish for love a bit ago.\" Green-Boy shook his head. \" Some middle-aged sad sack office worker with the hots for a young blonde intern.'I want her to love me! \", he said.\" Green-Boy drank more of his icey beverage. Al shook his head knowingly. \" What happened then?\" Green-Boy glanced over the rim of his drink. \" He knew nothing about her except that she was young and beautiful, you KNOW what happened next. They did n't get along, fought every day, he filed for divorce and got hit with huge alimony payments. And whose fault is all that, of course?\" \" Oh no, you evil monster genie, how could you do this to me, you tricked me, whaaaa boo hoo hoo!\" Al and Stardust laughed loudly as Green-Boy grimaced. Stardust slapped him on his thin shoulders. \" This is why I never grant wishes for love, friend. A man in love does not see beyond the next five minutes.\" \" Alright then, what's your story?\" Stardust crossed his arms across his muscular chest and laughed. \" Why all of my wishes are perfect! Some may, perhaps, be slightly less perfect than others, but they are still mostly-perfect.\" Al rolled his eyes. \" Oh wise and benevolent genie, regale us with your mastery and power of these slightly-imperfect wishes.\" Genie... wishes... suddenly I started noticing the nebulas on Stardust's body slowly shifting and moving across his frame. I caught a ridged pattern like leaf veins across Green-Boy's skin, and I noticed that Al's \" drink\" was n't just on fire, it was *literal* fire, and he was chugging it with gusto. Stardust boomed with laughter and steepled his hands in front of him. \" Oh my friends, I may just have a story for you. A man with a selfless heart used me to wish for World Peace.\" \"'World Peace'? Seriously?\" Al grimaced in mock pain. \" Yes! World Peace!\" Stardust laughed to himself before he continued. \" A difficult wish to facilitate, but I rose to the challenge. I chose to pursue peace by guiding the smartest of Men to create a global communication network, through which all Men could learn from each other and come to see each other as brothers.\" \" The Internet.\" Green-Boy scoffed. \" You invented the INTERNET. To fulfill a wish.\" \" Just so! I saw it come to fruition, connecting the world as it never had been before! Peace love and understanding had never been closer to the grasp of living Men!\" Al asked knowingly, \" And the selfless man's reaction when bridging the gaps of global distance did nothing to facilitate peace and understanding in the world?\" The three men... genies hollered in unison: \" Oh no, you evil monster genie, how could you do this to me, you tricked me, whaaaa boo hoo hoo!\" I watched them drink and laugh over their stories a bit more, until I had worked up the nerve to approach them. Genies.. real honest to god wish-granting GENIES. How could I pass this up? They turned to look at me as I approached. I stammered for a bit, unsure how to begin this conversation. \" Um... excuse me, gentlemen, I could n't help overhearing your conversation. How, uh... how would one go about asking for one of these... wishes?\" The three genies glanced at each other with irritation, shook their heads in resignation. Al chugged the last of his fire.

Next comes the sound of footsteps in the kitchen, into the living room, then, ever so slowly, the footsteps travel up the stairs. The steps stop at my door, and I hold my breath. It does n't matter if I know what's coming, I'm unbelievably easy to scare. And then, the footsteps start again, down the hall to Eli's room.

For a moment, his mind drifted into nostalgia. His mom used to cook him chicken noodle soup when he was sick. How he longed to see his mother again. Her touch, her laugh, her voice... he knew better than to focus on thoughts of the past and quickly shook them off. He opened his eyes. He was in a strange bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A box-fan on a fold out tea-table rattled near a screen window at the foot of the bed. The wall was littered with posters of country singers. Underneath one, was a dresser with make-up and jewelry scattered about it. \" Where am I?\" he thought. He sat up quickly, and a pain shot through his whole body. It was frightening, he could n't even remember last time he felt pain, probably during his last fight with Strange-o, a deranged clone of himself, but not even that beating brought about the amount of pain he felt now. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of clinking dishes in the next room. He attempted to peer through the wall. Nothing. His x-ray vision was n't kicking in. He strained his eyes trying to focus but it only caused his head to hurt. He placed his hand on his forehead in pain. The door creaked open. \" You're finally awake.\" came a voice sweet like honey. \" I've made you some soup.\" Mark looked up. It was an older woman, probably in her late forties. Strands of grey ran through her brown hair. Her eyes were deep blue and oddly youthful. Pocked skin hugged her face tightly. She had familiarity about her, but Mark could not place it. With knobby fingers, she held out a tray in front of him. On it, a bowl of steaming bowl of soup and glass of apple juice. \" Thank you.\" Mark said as he took the tray and placed it on his lap. She took a seat in a wooden chair next to the bed. \" Where am I? Who are you?\" \" I'm Karen.

I knew what would happen to you if I brought you to the hospital, so I brought you here. \" She was referring to a recent leak of classified documents released by whistleblower and hacker Julio Passant. In them it revealed that the US government had secretly been conducting experiments on super beings. \" Thank you. How long have I been out? \" Karen seemed hesitant to answer, \" T..two…two weeks. \" She finally managed. \" Though, you have been in and out of consciousness. \" Her compassion was amazing, caring for him for that long. \" Did I say anything? Do…do you know who I am? \" She reached out and placed her hand on his bare shoulder. \" You babbled some, but I really paid no attention. \" Her touch was tender, and welcome. It was rare for him to feel another humans touch. She smiled at him warmly. Even though she was older than him, he couldn't help but feel an attraction. That's when he noticed her front tooth. It was chipped. Fighting pain, he managed to peek over the edge of the bed at her ankle. A chain of daisies encircled it. He started to get dizzy. A flash of insight came, he had seen her at the diner; she wasn't old. It was him; his powers, they were sapping her life away. But how? He didn't even know her, let alone love her. Or did he? Perhaps at a subconscious level, her altruism and nurturing had moved him. He had been in and out of consciousness; he would have seen her, felt her touch. Still, he hadn't used his power, he couldn't use his powers. Unless, no, it couldn't be! All his power had been directed inward, to keep him from dying, to heal him. He had been using his powers this whole time. He tried to stand. His legs were weak and pain shot through him. He grabbed the blanket to steady himself, but he fell to the floor dragging it with him, spilling soup and juice. \" You have to get away from me! \" He yelled. \" I'm dangerous! \" \" Now don't you worry about me. \" Karen replied as she grabbed him and helped hoist him back on the bed. \" You don't understand, my powers, they are killing you. \" he was starting to sob. \" I know \" came the soft reply. \" I know. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He stretched luxuriantly, and rose from his bed after a few minutes relaxing. He savored the fresh morning air for a few moments and then walked over to the window, like every morning. Mary, his wife, was probably still at her parents'farm with the children, so it was pleasantly quiet. He'd found the house on San Francisco Bay around a year after the Impact. It had gone through the following panic and fires surprisingly well, with little damage that needed repairs. There was no sign of the former owners, not even bones. They'd probably fled north when the city ran out of food and the inhabitants went cannibal. One thing Tom always noticed when he looked out over the bay was how *clean* it looked eight years after society collapsed. No ugly freighters, no oil barges, not even grotesquely opulent private yachts. Now that the ships left in the bay had all gone down and the oil had mostly cleared up, it was finally starting to look wild again. Tom even thought he saw a gray whale off in the distance. After a few minutes just taking in the view, Tom turned around and went to the kitchen. This house had been a lucky find. The former owners clearly believed in living off the grid, and the oven could be powered either by wood or charcoal. The electric stovetop, like the rest of the house's electricity, was solar powered. Even after the fires, there was plenty of wood in the city, and he'd been able to scrounge a compact electric pickup to haul it, one of the last electric vehicles that growing industry had produced. Like every morning ( or afternoon; with the old office schedule gone, Tom had found himself waking up much later, though from the sun he guessed it might be around ten in the morning ), Tom pulled out a pan and set it on the stove, which he then set to heat up. He then pulled two eggs, a few strips of bacon, and an onion from the refrigerator before going down to the root cellar for a potato. Fried eggs, bacon, and hash browns seemed nice. His garden and chicken coop had been productive as always in this mild climate. And say what you will about feral pigs, they made good eating. Soon, Tom had his large breakfast together. No coffee, which was a small disappointment; the last he'd picked up from Hawaiian traders had just run out, but they'd be back soon. The freeholders and communities on the California coast did a better job at picking through the ruins than they could, and some chief always wanted something new that could n't be found in the rubble on Maui or Oahu. The fresh eggs and bacon were outstanding, far better than anything he could find at his grocery store before the Impact. As he was eating, he itemized the day's work in his head. Weed the garden and the field, meet with Bill Springer and Vic Thorpe to share news, plan hunts, and plan the next six months'bandit watch... nothing too unpleasant. Certainly preferable to the old routine, driving an hour to the office to write reports for eight hours, driving another hour home, and watching TV until it was time to go to bed. Sure, the first few years after the Impact were hard, but after most of the population had died off and he'd figured out what he was doing life became much better. He'd never eaten this well before the Impact, and he'd never been in better shape. And he was n't resigned to a bitter life as a bachelor, either. *Life is good, * Tom thought as he slung his rifle, picked up his tools, and walked out to the garden,", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Only two members of the flock had survived, one, unconcious, lay near the podium in the fetal position. The other, a small man with round specticals and a perfect part in his hair stood before the demon with his hands crossed. \" Now, it is time for you to die, tiny mortal\" Zorboth, the twelve-foot tall green demon bellowed. \" I simply refuse.

Yet he still refused to look away, to look down, to beg for mercy. Never before had Zorboth been denied the screams of a victim, never before had a man stood before Zorboth and refused, heart and soul, to be cowed. Screaming in fury, Zorboth struck out with a massive clawed backhand, stricking the man across the face and launching him several feet in the air. The man whimpered as he hit the ground and rolled. The man slowly began to regain his feet. As he shakily rose to one knee, he looked at Zorboth, and said in a quiet and confident voice \" The power of Christ will save me. The power of Christ deny's you, demon. The power of Christ will push you from this holy place!\" \" **SILENCE, MORTAL**\" screamed the demon as he launched himself at the man. Shoving his left hand forward, he shoved his claw directly through his stomach, so deep that he could see his arm coming out the mans back, and yet, he would still not scream. \" **WHERE IS YOUR LORD NOW, MORTAL? WHERE IS YOUR LORD NOW**\" laughed Zorboth, as he raised his right hand, he swung forward as quickly and strongly as he could, removing the mans head from his shoulders. He held the headless corpse in the air until the blood stopped sprouting from the neck, and finally dropped him to his feet. \" Hah\" Zorboth grinned. \" That is what I call fun.\" Turning to leave the building, Zorboth saw several minor demons moving outside. Being no larger than the pesky humans, the minor demons were left to destroy petty buildings while the higher demons were tasked with destroying places of the lord. As the giant demon made his way to the door, the last survivor of the congregation shakily stood. He stared at the massive green spine of the demon walking away, the demon that had killed his flock, and slowly dropped down to his knees. As he looked around at the bodies of all those who came to him over the years for advice, for wisdom, for forgiveness, he did something he had not himself done in many, many years. He prayed. \" You three\" screamed Zorboth \" Come, assist me with the bodies. We shall feast grandly tonight!\" \" *Yessssssss*\" yelped the smaller demons. \" *We wants to eats the humans! *\" \" Then **COME**\" bellowed the giant demon. \" And **HURRY UP**. His Eternal Darkness **WILL NOT** tolorate slow work.\" As the tiny demons moved towards the front door of the church, Zorboth turned around to survey the room, and for the first time in his near eternal life, was shocked silent. Kneeling in the center of the room was a man he was *sure* he killed. The man stood closer to 5 feet than 6, and looked as though he could not lift his own weight. His black clothing was in immaculate condition, not one cut or tear nor one stain of blood. His white collar shined like it was made of light itself. The most disturbing face was the *glow*. The stained-glass window of Jesus that rested at the top of the church was simply *shining*. The pastor had a ring of light around him 5 feet wide, and, to put it bluntly, he *looked* like someone who was recieving the blessing of the Lord. \" **IMPOSSIBLE**\". Zorboth shouted, foam flying from his mouth in his rage. \" **YOU WILL DIE LIKE THE REST**\". Zorboth screamed in fury as he ran from the doors at the entry to the church to the podium near the end. \" Thank you Lord.\" the man whispered to himself as he rose. Raising his head, the man looked at the behemoth sprinting towards him and said one simple word, just loudly enough to be heard, but that one word was enough to stop the demon in his path. \" No.\" \" You have killed my congregation. You have taken the flock from the shepard and for this, you will pay. My name is Stephen Foster, and **I SPEAK FOR OUR LORD WHEN I SAY YOU WILL DIE**\" Zorboth had halted when the tiny human rose before him. Never before had someone had the audacity to raise their voice at him. Snarling with fury, he stepped forward to end this mortals life when he noticed his *eyes*. They were *glowing*. The man's eyes shone with a white light that was brighter than he had ever seen and increasingly painful to look upon. Father Foster raised his right hand before him. Wrapped around his hand was a rosery, with the cross resting on the edge of his palm. \" I am a servant of the Lord, and I will not let any demon stand.\" The cross began to faintly glow with light \" **You are an abomination, and I will end you. THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLS YOU**\" screamed Father Foster, as the light *EXPLODED* from his palm. A beam of pure white light shot from the rosary, completely covering the Zorboth from head to toe. He never had a chance to utter a scream. When the light faded, not even a pile of ash remained. Three smaller demons, who had really been enjoying killing humans and not being ordered around by giant bossy-demons, watched from the doorway before turning, running, and screaming about \" the prophecy\". Shaking slightly, Father Foster put the rosary back around his neck. \" Thank you, Lord\" he whispered. \" I understand my mission now.\" Without looking back, the Father walked out of the church to begin his destiny.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "A story where the main character falls in love with the reader.", "output": "Things had been simple in elementary school. No one had batted an eye when Ada spoke of playing with her invisible friend Maggie, or setting out food for cats that no one had ever seen, or communing with a wind dragon that visited her on the breeze. It was all the work of a child's imagination, they had said. Ada was an imaginative girl, they had said. That sort of talk stopped happening when Ada spoke of the spirits to her new friends in middle school. They gave her strange looks. They called her \" weird\" and \" crazy.\" She stopped talking about the spirits altogether by the end of sixth grade, but the damage had been done; no one in her grade talked to her anymore. She kept the spirits a secret from even her family, lest they grow concerned for her mental health -- or worse, grow distant as her friends had done. At least she had the spirits for friends, or at least most of them. Some of them were n't friendly. Some could n't leave their homes to come along with her when her family moved. But the rest kept in touch, and she was grateful for that. Yet over the course of Ada's life, there had periodically appeared a vague, distant presence she could sense but not identify: something watching her. Not something sinister, but something curious. She often forgot about it. It did not show itself fully until one rainy fall evening when Ada was in ninth grade. Having finished her school assignments for the day, she had just finished changing into her pajamas and settling into bed for the night. Her room lights were off, but she was currently sitting up against her pillows with a booklamp-lit copy of *Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban* on her lap. It was her fourth time reading it. There was n't much better to do than reread books when one did n't have friends. A gust of wind dashed rain against her window, making a percussive cluster of noise. She also heard a thud and a pained \" oof!\" in the mix, drawing her attention to the window. \" Kaze-san?\" she whispered. \" Is that you?\" A little cyan-blue dragon of the Eastern type righted himself on the windowsill and shook himself off like a dog. < Hey, Ada, > he said in a voice only she could hear. < Sorry to startle you. > She giggled. \" It's fine. Are you okay?\" < Yeah, I'm fine. Rain messes up my flight patterns. > He smiled, but then he looked into her room at something. < Who's that? > Ada looked around. \" Who's who?\" But it only took a moment for her to realize what he meant. She sensed the presence then, in the room with her. It seemed familiar to her, as if she'd sensed it before. This time she could tell with certainty that it was watching her exchange with Kaze-san. It was interested in her. But she did not know who -- or what -- it was. \" Hello?\" she whispered into the dark. No answer came in words, yet as she began to ask more questions, she could somehow sense some of the answers. \" Are you watching me?\" Yes. \" Are you interested in me?\" Well, she was the main character, so yes. \" I'm the... main character? Of what?\" This story. \" What story?\" The one she was in. You did n't know where it would go yet, but that was why you were reading. And so it began. The longer a scene took, the more detail was presented, the more Ada felt that someone was watching her. Most of the time she did n't notice it. But for example, when she slipped in a puzzle of water left by the leaky drinking fountain behind the gym, she felt that someone wince in sympathy when she hit the concrete. And when she walked home one rainy spring afternoon with her head down, her hood pulled fully up, and her hands stuffed sullenly in her pockets because she had forgotten her umbrella, she suddenly felt that sympathy too, the sympathy of the watcher. She felt her heart flutter and grow warm. Someone in the world, even if it was someone invisible who did n't communicate clearly to her, cared about her. Someone was invested in her well-being, because she was the protagonist of a story. The reasons did n't matter. What mattered was that someone cared. < I care. > She looked at Kaze-san, an expression of apology on her face. Currently it was a bit after lunchtime on a certain day in the middle of summer vacation, and she sat in a lawn chair in the backyard with *The Golden Compass* in her lap. \" I did n't mean you did n't!\" she said to him, fearing she'd come across as insensitive. \" I just meant there's someone else, y'know? And it feels nice.\" She looked around the backyard. \" He's here somewhere now. I can feel him.\" Kaze-san did too. < He is? As of when? > \" As of just a second ago. Right when you said'I care.\"'< Huh. And you know he's a guy? > She bit her lip and looked at the little wind dragon. \" Uh, no. But I like to think he is.\" She sank back into the lawn chair, holding her book against her chest as she looked up into the sky with a dreamy smile. \" I bet he has a nice, soft face. He's sensitive, see. I feel him get sad when I feel bad or get hurt. It's really sweet of him.\" She sighed dramatically. < Look, I do n't doubt there's someone there, > Kaze-san said. He looked at a certain spot in the yard, the very place where your mind's eye had positioned itself, as if he could see you. < I'm more concerned that you feel this way about someone who does n't even talk to you. > Ada flinched and sat up. \" What did you do?\" she demanded of the dragon. \" You made him uncomfortable! I felt it!\" He eyed her with worry, taking a defensive step back across the patio. < That was kind of the point? > \" You do n't have to be a jerk to him! He cares about me! I thought you'd be happy about that.\" Kaze-san scowled. < I care about you too! And I worry this is n't healthy! > \" So I can talk to you, but not to him?\" < He does n't talk back! > \" He does! Kind of!\" Ada was red in the face by now. \" And if you're gon na be a jealous jerk, you might as well leave!\" < I am NOT a jealous -- > \" Just go.\" She rolled onto her side, away from the wind dragon. \" Go... kick up some ocean waves, or whatever.\" Kaze-san said nothing for a moment. He looked at you again, this time with a mix of confusion and sadness, and then leapt into the air, zipping away on the breeze. Ada waited for several seconds. Then she rolled onto her back and looked at the sky again. \" You do care about me, right, Mr. Watcher?\" Yes, you did, but the dragon kind of had a point. Her expression faltered. \" You... agree with him?\" There was a note of worry in her voice. Yes, you did agree with him. You could never truly reciprocate the feelings she had for you. You were but a reader of the story. She would do better to find someone in the story to love her. She was silent. Tears formed in her eyes. \" You do n't... love me?\" You certainly felt for her. She was the protagonist, after all. But that was n't love. Silence again. She sat up in the lawn chair, hunched over, and pressed her palms into her leaking eyes. \" I do n't know anyone,\" she cried. \" I do n't have any friends. How will I find someone else?\" You did n't know. You did n't know whether this story would have a happy ending or a sad ending. But you were hoping for a happy ending. \" That does n't make me feel any better,\" she whimpered. There was n't anything you could do. But you had a feeling Ada might have the power to make her own happy ending if she owned up to it. She sniffled as she pulled her hands away and looked at the sky again. \" You think I can do it?\" If she was saying that, she probably could. It took a moment, but a smile flickered across her face. \" I'll try, Mr. Watcher,\" she said. \" Thank you.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Rick had had enough. He stood on the rooftop of his 6 story apartment building, looking down at the ground morbidly. Rick did n't believe in god. It just seemed too good to be true. His father had commited suicide when he was younger and it had left him dead inside. He did n't hope to see him on the other side, but he was tired of not seeing him here. He was tired of his personality disorder. He was tired of having to be around psychiatrists. He was tired of meds. He was tired of being lonely. He was tired of life. Things had become so dull. Taking the pills had left him an apathetic shut-in. Without the pills he'd be back in a hospital again. The only thing his father had left him was a severe case of bipolar disorder. \" Fuck you dad,\" he whispered. \" Fuck you for leaving.\" His chest ached but no tears would come. He stepped up to the edge of the roof. His resolve wavered. He knew he couldnt do it. He hated himself. He wished someone would just push him. \" Its easier with a gun isnt it Dad?\" It began to rain. Rick walked along the edge of the roof, balancing on the lip. There had been a time in his life when he was good at things. Everything used to come easy. Now.. now he couldnt even muster the courage to jump. He picked up his phone and dialed his exgirlfriend. It went to voicemail. No surprise. She had been ignoring him for almost a year. It was an automated message. He wouldnt even hear her voice one last time. \" Hi Lara. Its Rick. I wont try to talk to you anymore. I dont know why we havent talked.. I never really knew what happened.. I know you probably moved on..\" Rick sighed. \" Ive always loved you. Always. I hope you found someone that..\" Rick sighed again. \" I wish I had the courage to kiss you the last time we were alone together. I just didnt want to lose you again. I wanted to be friends, forever. I just wanted to be with you. Im happiest with you. I-\" Rick was interrupted by the automated voice. \" Sorry the voice mail box has already been full. Please-\" Rick threw his phone. It smashed after falling for a few seconds. Someone walked up to his phone, picked it up and looked up. \" Oh my god! Do n't jump! I'm calling the police\" Rick ran to the other side of the roof and jumped. \" So?\" Rick, no, Nathan slowly removed his DreamGear helmet. \" Nathan?\" The man snapped his fingers. \" Hey.\" \" Sorry. I just.. dying was so..\" \" Hmm. Oh yes I imagine that last bit was a little.. disorienting.\" Nathan blinked, shaking his head. \" Well do you remember it all?\" \" You're Leon right?\" Nathan asked. \" Ah so you remember your previous life. Good. I was worried the old memories would be overwritten.\" \" You didnt say it would be so depressing!\" \" Hey. I said the variables would be randomized. It had to feel as real as possible. The whole point of this game was total immersion.\" \" Fuck you Leon. This game is sick. I commited suicide Leo. I jumped off a building.\" \" Yes but how do you feel about your life now?\" \" Well it doesnt seem so bad anymore... all my worries seem a little trivial. I mean, I definitely have it way better than Rick.\" \" Do you remember what I asked you the day you came into my office?\" Nathan paused. It was only yesterday but his memories still felt mixed up. \" You asked why I wasnt happy, even though I have such a good life.\" \" Yes,\" Leon replied. \" Well arent you happy that you have a wife at home?

{"input": "4yr Contest Voting - Round One ( of two )", "output": "/u/Hatsya in Group B for \" I do\". the dialogue tends to be a little unrealistic sometimes, but it suits the piece well. it reminds me of this girl I saw: she was wearing an understated dress ( though it was lovely ) and had on a pair of incredible heels. the dialogue is the focus here, and it's dialogue which is what carries this story, so for me, the dialogue made sense in what it was, and Candice's position as an author helped make it easier to accept. that being said, the prose is wonderful; it adjusts around the scene. it is used to bring the reader how Joaquin feels through association; at first, the bride is inhuman in her stony coldness and her relation with snakes and her precise and musical behavior, a foreign creature; Joaquin does n't understand her. the pearl necklace is a noose, a threat; it's how Joaquin thinks this marriage is for her. there's so many other examples, but I do n't want to ramble too long, but I was impressed by it, the quiet way things are said, beyond the frank and honest dialogue ( which I thought was refreshing and a good sign between the two ). the author clearly has a beautiful command of language. I also admire the bravery of doing a single scene over 4k words. it's a good scene to make a whole story out of: there is so much tension, from the fact that the wedding is about to occur, to the fact that they are both in a room ( closed and private and leaving both of them nowhere to run, and with a mirror ohoho ), to the intense topic of their intense conversation. SO MUCH TENSION! but for me, it's always been frightening to do something like put two people talking for over 4000 words in an unbroken scene, for a lot of reasons I wo n't go into. I respect that the author chose to. I think what affected me more than anything, though, was what the story was really about. \" I do\" is a story about two people about to be married. beyond that, it is about love: love for adults who have long waded past the sparkling sort of love in youth, love is that is not a fire that will burn everything down but a fire to keep people warm, love that comes slowly. it is an examination on what love is, and denies the idea that the oft-seen \" true love\" is the only kind of love. and truth is that it's not: an it's a hard truth, that maybe someone might not feel that sort of all-consuming passion again, that maybe someone will never feel it ever, but it's a truth they both come to terms with, together. and in that, there is a love just as worthy as any other. gosh that was a lot of, um, talking, LOL. here are my ( much briefer, apologies ) reviews for the rest of group B! *RUNNER-UPS* - **Living With It by /u/page0rz**: this story was such a close contender. I loved this, a lot; it was like Hatsya's in that it had a really hard truth ( the friend's letter to the main character was so, so striking; it was painful to read, in a good way ) and showed apathy and depression and the rise from it beautifully. I noted in a lot of other reviews, people said they thought the prose was too heavy; I actually loved it! I think the issue I found with it was that it did n't feel like it was building to me. it was level, steady, and then there was the ( so, so beautiful ) time of him escaping from it. I think it's possible to build up stakes/tension getting there in a way that feels more solid. nevertheless, a beautiful story. - **Diner du Duane by /u/Mirari_Inanis**: you write so beautifully! the prose was practically sparkling. this story was also armed with a wonderful cast, a wonderful setting, etc.: it was so, so charming. but charm in itself was not enough to carry it. there was n't enough growth, direction, tension ( all of which I suck at honestly! ). I think it's possible to have a character-driven story with a more subtle current; I think if the pressure of the restaurant going out of business was more focused and consistent, the ending would feel more powerful, and the piece itself would feel more unified and stronger as a whole. still, it was an enjoyable read, which I liked! - **How We Dive by /u/LonelyLightbulb**: I love dreams and I love your theme ( it makes sense it was cathartic to write for you; it came through wonderfully ) and I love the concept of this. also your writing can be so pretty! however, the beginning was too confusing and too muddled; a cleaner start and show of what's happened would have helped a lot. I think another issue was that for me, some of the issues combined felt a little too melodramatic ( which is hypocritical of me because I write and breathe melodrama HAHA ). it was too much, like it was trying to force me to feel sad for him. that being said, I really liked this story, and I was happy to read it! *REST OF REVIEWS* - **Dropdown, Meltdown, Lovestruck by /u/Atricity**: this story had a lot of confidence and focus. I think it could benefit from a closer POV ( there was a lot of, \" we talked about\" \" I would do\" -- it'd be nice to see real-time talking and real-time action and real-time thoughts ). I thought the main character was very sympathetic, but I felt also like the way things worked out was too unrealistic, too strange, and it detracted from the story for me. ( side note: paragraph when a new person speaks! it makes the story easier to read ) - **Heading Home by /u/Mofofett**: I liked this concept! it was interesting for a lot of reasons. I think for me I wish there was more thought on the fact that he had just killed the girl throughout the story; I felt as though it was occasionally forgotten, and not in the sort of \" shock denial\" way. still, the conclusion the character had to come to was well done; good work! - **Never too late by /u/nickofnight**: gosh I love old people romance ( that sounds kind of creepy, huh? )! this was sweet and the ending was wonderful. I think for me, it's just that something about the story felt a little too perfect, a little too conventional; it was too on-the-tracks. - **Track Maintenance by /u/Rimpocalypse**: you have a really nice style of writing, very clean on the eyes! for me the main issue was the wife of the main character: she was too horrible, and it felt boring and strange to me for that reason. people are dull if you only show one side of them, good or bad; I would have liked to see her be more humanized, make the issues in their relationship weigh less on her and more on the differences between them; perhaps they disagree on how to communicate, or maybe he just does n't like art and they are way way way too incompatible on interests. also, I was n't a fan that he found her again so cleanly. - **Goodbye by /u/writing_for_fun**: I could not sympathize with the main character, and disliked him a lot; I could n't tell if it was meant to be unreliable narrator or not. still, it was clean, certain writing, which I appreciated! ( side note: watch dialogue punctuation - someone else already pointed it out I think, though? ) overall, Group B was a pleasure to read; good work, everyone!", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "Write a story with as many plot twists as you can.", "output": "Who am I? It's not important - all you need to know is who I will become, or rather who I became: a man with a singular destiny so profound it has and will change the face of the world as we know it, a dutiful soldier with a mission of dire circumstances and even more dire consequences ( fail or succeed ), a child who never knew his father not for lack of trying, an adolescent who lost his mother too soon, an adult who set all aside for a greater cause. An assassin. My target was an easy one, a civil servant in the state of Austria, born illegitimately to a peasant woman of increased age, but my mission was fraught with difficulty - not only was I meant to end this man's life, but I was also to assume his identity and continue his work as if no change had occurred. The concept was a troublesome one even when the natural similarity in our appearances was enhanced with minor surgery as I'd had to learn the man's most minute mannerisms and speech patterns. Having had some success in the semi-militaristic environment as a customs official in Branau am Inn, my target Alois Schicklgruber, had many acquaintances as well as a wife, and fooling them was no easy task, yet I accepted the job because of it's grave significance. On a cold night in late 1876, I hid in the shadows outside Alois'home until his company of colleagues had left him alone and inert from the gallon of beer he had guzzled. From the window, I could see his chest rise and fall in steady pace, his hand absently scratching his belly moments before his half-shut eyes sealed themselves fully. His wife had gone to visit her family on the other side of the country, and the only company in the fairly-sized home were the mice that scuttled in for warmth. The lock took much longer to bypass than I had expected ( a full ten seconds ), but once I was inside, even the creak of its hinges were unable to awaken the man. He was slightly pudgy, and the mustache he wore was the dominant feature of his face. Mine had been growing for the past month, but it was not nearly as brandished as his - although with time, it would get there. I released a small blade from my pocket, barely two inches in length, and sharper than a scalpel as I hovered over his neck. The man's pulse was evident as it bumped its way up his jugular artery into his head, and I watched it for a while. It is always moments before I make my kill that I become philosophical, and although I'd completed over a dozen missions in the past, this one was the one that scared me. In the past, I had always been the mere killer, and some unknown agent would take the role of the dead man if necessary. I had been trained for this, and I had been the agency's most successful assassin, but even with all my training, the deep human connection that questions whether I had any right to change this man's future was always present. Who was I to choose this man must die so that I could succeed in my mission? And who was I that I believed so strongly in this mission? I was never any good at accepting instructions from authority ( you can blame my distant father or dead mother for that ), and I often wondered if I was simply a product of what I had been told, of the limited \" truth\" someone had passed onto me in a form of manipulation too vast to be discovered, but one truth was certain: I believed in this mission too much to let the worry of morality over killing one man to save a million overcome me. I sliced his artery and held a rag to collecting the flowing liquid as it poured out, occasional splatters sending droplets in the distance. He never woke up. But a sound startled me from behind. A young woman held a horrified look on her face as whimpers slipped through her fingers, her body falling to her knees as terror overtook her eyes. I sighed - another life lost in the pursuit of greater good, where did it end? - but her shaking head and tears made me hesitate. There was a profound beauty about her, an innocence that only exists in those who are young and those you are good, that brought me to my own knees in front of her, that made me whisper sweet lies to console her: *Do n't be alarmed. This man was not whom he claimed to be. He was my brother long ago, but after killing our mother, he took on my name. For the last four years, i have chased him across the country to reclaim what was mine. * She eyed me in wonder, fear still engulfing her, but her hysterics had quieted, and I knew I had won. I put her to bed in the other room while I went about the business of disposing my target's flesh, and once I had ensured that no witnesses could surprise me again, I pulled a screen from my bag. On it was the real target of my mission, to whom I Alois Schicklgruber was now distantly related: Klara Polzl. It was her I was meant to seduce in order to prevent the birth of her child, Adolf. But first, I would have to find a priest to change the damned surname I could not properly pronounce if I were to seamlessly integrate myself into this man's life. *Only once I am Alois Hitler can I go about the task of seducing this woman, * I thought to myself while watching the beautiful Anna sleep... and conquer my heart.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "The year is 2015 and the Pope has called for a crusade.", "output": "Blessings be upon you, brothers and sisters in Christ gathered before me today. For months you have been engaged in the preparations for our great undertaking, and the Church extends her thanks to you and to all our devout brethren around the world for your efforts and prayers in this difficult time. Today I stand before you clad for the last time in all the finery of my office. This golden staff, this papal crown…all this I trade tomorrow for the garb of a crusader, that I may go forth amongst you Christian soldiers as we do the work of Christ. This role as crusader I consider a greater honor, a higher calling than Pope, for if the Lord calls, what choice have we but to follow? But make no mistake, my children. Though it be a Crusade and you Crusaders, we do not mean to repeat the sins of the past. For once the Church did seek to take Jerusalem, calling it the Holy Land. Once the Church did battle the infidel and the heathen, spilling blood and bone across the lands our Lord once trod. Eight times did we Christians seek to grasp the world. And eight times did we succeed in nothing but shattering the heart of our loving Father. Those were dark times then, both for Mother Church and Father God…but we shall not dwell on them now, for this Ninth Crusade will herald a new beginning. Today, my children, in this Crusade we shall not aim for the temples of Jerusalem or the forts of Antioch. For I tell you in truth, that the Holy Land is not a place. It is neither the Temple on the Mount nor the Tomb of David, neither the manger under the Star or the hill He breathed His last. They Holy Land, my children, lies in the hearts of suffering Man. It lies wherever there are starving children, widowed brides, or crying mothers. It lies in the slums of Rio and the streets of Grozny, in the inner-cities of Detroit and the darkest corners of Africa. The Holy Land, my children, can be found wherever our fellow men lie stricken of disease, hunger or want. For it is in these areas where we might do the most good….and it is these hearts that our Lord is most desperate to save. So, my brothers and sisters, fellow Crusaders! I beseech you to, from this day forth, leave the comforts of your homes and the cages of your habit, and go out into the world. I beg you to join me in this Ninth Crusade. That together we might retake the Holy places on our Earth from their torment under the Devil's legions of Want, Need, and Poverty. Follow not your misguided forefathers, my children. In this Ninth endeavor you shall have no arms but Love, no steeds but Hope, and no armor but your Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. You shall say to the Turk and the Saracen that you come not to take but to give, not to kill but to heal, and not to convert, but to understand. For verily, I say, our Lord died for all mankind, and so you shall call the Moslem \" Brother \", and the atheist \" Friend \". Together were we put here on this Earth….and it is only together that we can advance with joy into the new millennia. With this, my children, I call into being the Ninth Crusade. This will be a Crusade with a beginning but one that will have no end. I trust that you and I will work together as long as it might take….if need be our entire time here on Earth, in the service of our fellow man. Let us retake the long-ignored hearts from Poverty and Want. Thus shall be our mission, today, tomorrow…and every following day until Christ our Lord show himself once again in our midst. *Ave Maria*…. *Deus Vult*….God bless you all, my children.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I eased up a little, or as much you could with man staring you, a little grin across his face. \" Its a pretty view out the window, is n't it.\" He remarked. I glanced outside. Mountains rose up in the distance, and there were many trees closer to us, obscuring any real view. \" I guess.\" I agreed. After all, I did n't know anything about the man sitting in front of me. He seemed friendly enough, his sweater looking in its prime, his face well shaven, and one hand firmly in his jean pocket and the other resting on the back of the seat. \" So why are you on the late night train?\" He asks. \" I've got be in westchester in the morning.\" I responded. \" From Chicago to westchester? Thats quite the ride.\" He replied. \" Yeah, I guess so. Do you know where anyone is? I'm feeling a bit parched.\" I asked. \" Now, now we do n't wa n't to get curious.\" He creepily replied.

You said you were thirsty? I'll get you a drink, now do n't go anywhere.\" He said, his voice an oil dripping off the tongue. I slightly recoiled because something in his voice sent a chill up my spine, and I hoped to god he did n't notice. If he did, he did n't react as he got up, moving to the end of the cabin. \" I've got to go in the next one over to get the drinks. I'll be back in a second.\" He explained. As soon as he exited the cabin, I was on my feet and looking around. Thousands of questions raced through my mind, and bounced around my skull. Who was this man? Why is no one else on this train? How can I get out of here? I knew had a limited time before he came back, first I tried the door he did n't exit, shoving my body weight up against it. It was locked. I looked around for some way out. A fire extinguisher in a \" break glass if emergency\" case caught my eye. Perhaps it would lead me to salvation. I hear foot steps and step away from the door that I was trying to open. The man poked his head through the door. \" I forgot to ask you, what do you want? The mini bar is open.\" He formally inquired. \" Oh, uhhh, I guess I'll guess have a scotch on the rocks.\" I said, absently minded. As soon as he left I smashed the glass and took out the extinguisher. I used it to break the doorknob on the cabin and walked out of the cabin. Out here, it was much colder, and ground seemed to be rushing below me much faster. I tried the next door and it opened easy. I thanked my stars and started to continue though the train when the man opened the door to the first cabin. He dropped the drinks in his hands and started to sprint towards me. I broke into a run and slammed the door behind me, fire extinguisher still in hand. I start opening and closing the doors behind me, putting distance between the man and I when suddenly I open the door, and there is no next carriage. I turned around as the man opened the door at the beginning. The cold wind grips me as I stand exposed at the pack the train. The man holds a shard of glass that looks like it used to be a part of a scotch glass. \" I thought I told you to stay put. Looks like you'll have to join the others.\" he said in a deadly monotone. Then, he charged me, his arm extended, bringing the broken glass to the front of his offensive. I preemptively dodged left and started a swing with the fire extinguisher. His glass struck me, but not all that significantly, and my fire extinguisher makes sudden and painful contact with his face. His charge means he overshot and he grabbed hold railing to stop himself, wasting a critical second. I recovered from the first blow and regained control of my fire extinguisher. By this time time he went in for another stab and made a driving blow into my gut, I had to hope it was nonlethal, and make a counter attack. I kneed his defenseless crotch and made another blow to the face with the extinguisher. He recoiled almost all the way through the gap in the railings, but was able to just save himself by grabbing onto one of them. He made one last attempt to stab me and his improvised knife raked a deep scratch across my chest. Any second thoughts I had about seeing if he would stop attacking left me and I flung the extinguisher as hard as I could at his face. He lost his grip and fell of the train, his body hitting the ground which moved fast below us. It was not long before the darkness swallowed his body and I could n't see him any more. I wandered back to the carriage where he had the gotten the scotch from, found the mini-fridge, and poured a nice glass of scotch for myself.

A large, thick plume, more colossal than anything I had previously imagined. It billowed up and strangled the sky, wrenching it from the view of those little people who were of the physical. It looked like it was a decent distance away - I'd say about where the city was. Naturally, a burning curiosity got the better of me I grabbed my things from the makeshift shelter and began walking through the woods. A few hours later, I began to see the dead trees. Not all of them, mind you many were withered, and near them were sickly animals and dead cubs, curled and shivering at the base of the trees like a baby at the teat. Helpless and utterly dependent. The next thing I noticed was the smell. Pungent, a bit like a mix between sulphur and piss; it was getting stronger the closer I got. Things were getting deader and smellier the further I went, and by now the smoke had enveloped everything above me - a sky of seamless greyness, and as I looked up it began to snow. No, no that could n't be right. It was *warm*. The snow was grey, and carried with it a sense of ominous foreboding. I considered turning back, but remembered that the cabin was too far back to reach by nightfall. The only way was ahead, toward this dead grey snow, through this dead grey land under a dead grey sky. As night fell, I crested the hill overlooking the capital and the situation became apparent. It was black. None of the lights I had come to despise, none of the business and self-absorption I had hated for so long, just deadness. Some parts of the city were piles of stone, like an inhibited child had tried to build a replica pyramid out of local pebbles. I could hear voices and I could hear screaming. I descended into the town, growing increasingly anxious. Never before had Vancouver looked so desolate. The streetlights were out, some broken. Not a single electric light pierced the darkness. One thing that did, however, was the burning pile of corpses lying in the middle of the road, all on their lonesome. I could n't look. The smell and the smoke made my eyes water, and I ran past. I ran and ran and bumped into a woman. She looked about thirty, and was the very definition of bedraggled - coated in blood, matted hair, the works.

Rick announced, \" Here we are\" as he held his face up the iris scanner which unlock the door with a clunk. The room was n't dark but it was n't lit either. Warmer, humid air escape the room and rushed past us. There were two rows of five pedestals. On each pedestal was a square aquarium filled with some liquid. Each aquarium was lit from underneath, some with red light, some with green. The aquariums all had thick bands of wires running from top to a common track suspended from the ceiling. All the wires ran back to a dark room with racks of blinking severs. As I was struggling to see what was in the aquariums, Rick grabbed my elbow and pushed me toward the last aquarium in the back row. He said, \" This is your work space\", as he pointed at the aquarium. There was a name plaque under the aquarium with my name in gold letters. The aquarium was empty. The next aquarium in line had a human brain in it with wires coming out if it from every square inch. The name plaque read Alfred Redding. I had meet Alfred at my doctor's office, we attended several of the same studies. Alfred had Hyperthymesia. I vomited on the tile floor. Rick grabbed my arm to stop me from falling. I broke free ran out the door and navigated the maze to the nearest fire exit. Within the hour I received a text. \" You have violated your Google employment contract.

If we detect your movement is not toward your google office, Google Security will be dispatched to collect you.\" I guess I should have read those on-boarding documents more carefully.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

If only they knew with a mere strong thought they could reverse the switch. But they're just confused and that's when I kill them. I kill them so I can harvest their power for my own use. I am basically a god by now. A God of Death and Power. But the best part? *Nobody knows* The people merely think their precious heroes died of natural causes or simple misfortune, because in the end, who would dare attack a famous hero? And here I am, in my apartment, planning my final switch before I step out of the shadows and stop hiding. There's one more hero I need to switch with; a man who bares the name Frederick Lockest. He's my final target, my goal, my magnus opus. I took down those with all types of superhuman strength, those with levitation and regeneration abilities and even those with telepathy. But Frederick... he's something else. You see, every power is unique. Some might look the same but in the end, they all have their differences. I have all Earth's heroes ordered in my list and I have made the switch with all the ones I would need. Frederick though is the only one with a blank line next to his name.

I remembered dying. I remembered raising my hand to shield myself. Not that it helped, there wasn't much I could do to stop a bus. I kept my eyes squinted as the landscape slowly came into view. There was a path that led straight out with dusty ground on either side of it. A sign bearing the word'REGISTRATION'with a large arrow pointed in the same direction. I turned around, but the way back was blocked by a large metal door. Thick stone walls rose on either side of it, stretching up and across. \" Hello? \" I knocked on the door and waited. There was no bell, no intercom, nothing to press. Nothing but a large metal door. I knocked again. \" Hello? Where am I? \" No reply. With no options, I started walking. Vegetation began to sprout as I made my way down the path. Sparse grass became tall trees, green and full of life. The dusty path slowly gave way to a paved cement walk, bordered by grated drains. A small, single-story building was at the end of the walk. It was white with large windows and a gently sloping red tiled roof. The same sign I saw earlier stood in front, beckoning me inside. \" Hello? \" I said as I opened the door. This must be the reception. It looked just like a dentist's office. Everything looked sterile. Three chairs with black leather seats and thin metal hand rests were backed against a wall, interspaced by a neatly arranged magazine stand and a large potted fern. I walked up to the reception and rang the bell. On the wall was a poster, titled'The Second Chance Program. \" I rang the bell again. \" Hello? Is anyone aro- \" \" Hi there! \" I spun around as I heard the voice. It belonged to a portly woman in what appeared to be some sort of clinical uniform. She had a pleasant face topped by a full head of brown curls, and was carrying a clipboard which she was now consulting. \" Mister… Ford? Yes? \" She said, glancing up at my face before looking at the clipboard again. \" Yes, yes, Mr. Ford it is. Very good. Please follow me. \" I followed her down the hallway into a spacious white room. It was empty except for two sofas in the middle that stood facing one another, separated by a low glass coffee table. A large window on the far side kept the room bright. \" Please Mr. Ford, have a seat. Would you like something to drink? \" \" No. I'm okay. No wait. No, Yes. I mean yes. Yes please I would like a drink. Some water would be great. What – Where am I? \" \" This is the registration center Mr. Ford. Please, have a seat. \" She indicated towards the sofa as she sat down on the opposite one and reached under the table. She continued as she handed me a bottle of water. \" It says here on your file that you were eligible for a second chance. Now, Mr. Ford, do you think you could tell me the manner of your death? \" \" Wait I'm sorry, did you say second chance? Just what is going on? \" \" The manner of your death Mr. Ford? \" She looked at me patiently, her legs together and arms neatly folded across them, waiting for an answer. \" I uh… I got hit by a bus. \" \" And? \" \" And… here I am? \" I replied, confused. \" Oh you mean why? \" She nodded. \" I mean, I was just waiting for the bus, and this kid, couldn't have been more than 8 or 9, he must've been riding his bike and lost control or something… the next thing I knew he was on the road and the bus was coming and yeah. \" \" You saved him Mr. Ford? \" \" Well, yeah. I guess. I pushed him out of the way. It just happened so fast, I didn't really think, and the next thing I knew the bus was in front of me and then I woke up outside that building with the voice telling me I was free to go.

See, the people in charge decided that most mortals were, for the most part, good people. That there were so many factors influencing one's actions on earth, it wouldn't really be fair to condemn someone to suffer for all eternity after just one try. \" \" What does this have to do with me? I mean, this is the first time I've died. \" \" This is the only time you remember Mr. Ford. You've died many times. \" I stared at her as she looked back, an easy smile on her face. She didn't seem the slightest bit fazed about anything that was happening. \" As I was saying Mr. Ford, the powers to be decided that eternal condemnation wasn't the best way to go about things, thus the second chance program was introduced. Most people who couldn't make it to heaven the first time round got to try again. Well, more than once actually, despite what the program name might suggest. \" \" But - I was called a prisoner. Did I do something wrong? I'm sorry but this is all news to me. \" \" Your only wrong, Mr. Ford, was not doing enough right. And so after your first death, you were reborn again, as a different person, but with the same soul. New memories, new body, new life – but still the same person. And this happens again, and again, and again, until you lived a life where you did enough good things to make it to heaven. For the most part, most souls do have enough good in them that in the right situation, they perform exceptionally. And so we let them keep trying, over and over, until they can make it to heaven. The ones that don't, well, they just never make it. \" I sat there stunned, the open bottle of water resting in my hand. None of this made any sense, yet, I knew she was telling the truth. \" And the prisoner thing? \" \" Semantics. \" I nodded, this time taking a sip of water. \" Welcome to heaven Mr. Ford, you are free to go. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Some useless'swipe decided to take a diver onto the third rail of the SideTown Green and they've been rerouting traffic and passengers all over town to cover for the resulting outtage.\" Seargent Spickles gave me the evil eye -- again -- and mumbled something about respect for the dead, but I've never really seen the point. Near as I can tell the dead are either the lucky bastards that do n't have to put up with this hellhole of a planet or the completely uncaring jerks that do n't care because they do n't exist. Like that's enough of a reason. Either way, they're dead and unless something pretty big changes, the dead either ca n't or wo n't make any displeasure known. So why be respectful? He showed me the stiff -- I never get called to investigate why someone wins the lottery, only when they take a dive off the high board into an empty pool. \" Okay, dead guy, two stab wounds, one in front, one in back. That's unusual. Broken neck. And who ever did this had it in for his knees and... oh, that's a bit unusual. Tell me Spickles, how mad do you have to make someone to get this sort of mutilation?\" He hates when I call him Spickles. His real name is some foreign conglomeration of needing to buy a few more vowels from the Samoans -- it's Polish or some other East Euro mouth killing insanity. I never bothered to remember it. Spickles was known for bringing vinegared cucumbers and other veggies as part of his lunch, and the name stuck. He answered anyway, \" Pretty angry, I'd guess. Almost like someone could n't be bothered to use someone else's real name.\" Oof. That was hard-hitting for him. Spickles is not an aggressive personality. Stolid. It was a great word, and it described him perfectly. He did a good job as far as that went, but his imagination -- like his temper -- was fairly non-existent. \" Yeah. This was personal, so any ideas what he's doing in this hotel?\" Spickles shrugged. \" Desk staff said he'd checked in yesterday then about an hour later three different women had asked for his room number.\" \" Well that makes it pretty simple. Sounds like he was meeting a some hooker here and a jealous girlfriend or wife found out and did a number on him.\" As I said it I still wondered. Something else was off. The angles of attack were wrong. I could see that. I mean, I'm not some super-human Sherlock, but even I could see that the angles of attack were different. And while he was n't wearing any rings -- hardly a shock -- looking at his hands I could see he was n't a guy that wears *any* rings. So either unmarried or in a line of work where rings are a bad idea. \" Any chance we know what the stiff did for living before having his delicates turned into mince?\" Spickles gave me that look again, but as usual only said, \" Yeah, he's an accountant.\" Figures. Of course, the accountants are usually the ones with money, so three women as lovers struck me as something that might be possible. \" He was n't married after all, was he?\" \" Nothing in the records about a wife or girlfriend. The superintendent at his flat said he lives alone. Over in Golden Orange neighborhood. Nice places -- pricey.\" I gave that a ponder. Guy did have money. So what was he doing here with three women. If he lived alone, why get a hotel room and let three women know about. \" Have we got any idea about who the women are?\" \" We're running the security footage angles through a facial recognition comparator with the DMV and public records, but so far no hits, Detective.\" \" Good. So, Spickles, let me have a look at that footage.\" \" Sure. We've got it on the laptop in the main room. Check it out. Wo n't help much.\" I sauntered back into the main area of the hotel suite -- nice digs, really. I wondered how many people were murdered in hotel rooms each year. The footage was pretty boring -- three women, two tall, one shorter. All three Asian descent and quite beautiful. The kind of look that webcam sites love -- not that I'd know, obviously. I pointed them out to Frankfurter. There's a man who loves his hotdogs. I'd heard that extended outside the food realm, but I've never been a good judge of that sort of thing. All I know is that unlike Spickles, Frankfurter had embraced the nickname. I admired that in a man. \" Lookers, all of them. Ca n't blame him for wanting to meet with any one of them, but all three at once seems a tad greedy.\" He grunted. Maybe there was something to that rumor. I shrugged and went on, \" The stiff in there clearly had a type.\" \" Yeah, Asian and busty.\" Ah, that was Fahimeh. I'd never come up with a good nickname for her for some reason, but unlike Frankfurter, she'd made it clear to me that she liked women better than men. Or at all. \" Wash, they are all out of your league, and honestly, mine too. Not that it'd stop either of us trying.\" I grinned. \" True, but the fact that at least two of them just killed that slabcadet in there would. Well, at least a little. Something tells me that they thought they had a good reason.\" \" Hey Wash, get a look at this!\" Frankfurter again. He pushed something at me. I took it and looked at it pretty close. \" Oh. That's interesting.\" \" Right? It was embedded in that lamp over there.\" A tiny button camera. The kind that pervs and weirdos have been hiding in public bathrooms for ages now. I mean I like naked people -- well, naked *women* -- as much as anyone, but I do n't need to see them doing their business on a toilet. And consent matters. Actually that's part of why I got into the job in the first place -- different story though. \" Well, can we get the data off this? I want to see what it can tell us.\" \" Yeah, it's small, but there's an embedded memory chip -- enough for twenty hours or so of moderate resolution video and audio.\" He set it on the laptop while he monkeyed around with some wireless connection -- maybe some bluetooth voodoo or something -- for a bit. I'm good with stiffs and mysteries, not tech. Usually end up blowing up whatever it is that I'm trying to work on. Or just turning it into a useless pound or so of circuitry. After a minute he pulled up a video and we all watched. Boring at first, but then the first woman-the short Asian showed up. Not five minutes later the tall redheaded gal knocked on the door and that's when it got interesting. The two women had looks on their faces that should have had him running for the door. When the third one showed up, also looking angry as she saw the first two, what looked to be a badly planned tryst turned into something that even I had n't thought of. A job interview. He explained it calmly, and every second that he talks, all three women looked more angry. Then the real kicker. He was interviewing them for job of being his wife. That takes balls. I looked at the squad and they were all just as stunned. Fahimeh spoke up first. \" Detective, can we just write this one off as justifiable homicide?\" I thought about that, but Frankfurter's laugh was distracting as he said, \" I'm with you on that. But the Captain would probably have different ideas.\" \" About what, sergeant?\" Captain Frigate ( legal name something something John England -- *boring* ) walked in at this point, just in time to hear Frankfurter's comment. I spoke up -- senior man in the room besides the captain. \" Sir, have a look at this.\" He watched it and at the end said, \" And what is our plan to find and catch these women?\" I shrugged. \" I dunno Captain. The bastard seems to have deserved it. I think if you give Fahimeh the equipment she'd be happy to make the body just disappear.\" He gave me a sour look. \" I understand that, but unfortunately he's the Mayor's second cousin or some such.\" \" So he's a well-connected idiot?\" Frigate does n't always appreciate my stunning wit. Apparently this was one of those times. \" Detective Wash, while the Mayor has n't said anything yet, I think that even you should be able to understand that he would n't appreciate that characterization of a family member. Even if they did hate each other. At least in public. In private he's probably inclined to agree.\" \" Okay boss, I'll round them up, but I'm telling you that a good lawyer is probably going to get these ladies a free pass on this one.\" Frigate nodded. \" Yeah. Let's hope at least one of the women is moderately well-connected. Because you're right. They've probably done us all a public service. Get it done, Wash.\" \" Yes, sir.\" He left, and we cleaned up the scene as best we could after bagging and tagging all the evidence. Boring crap, but it pays. Of course it just goes to show that being smart is n't proof against being stupid. Which pretty much sums up my opinion of humanity anyways. Wash out.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Let's see, there was the ice cream truck, I swerved to avoid hitting all those children, and then... crap. I leapt out of the casket, but no-one seemed to respond. Makes sense. I'm a ghost, after all. I wandered into the pews and listened to hear what they were saying about me. \" He was such a hero,\" said my old football coach. \" If only we'd paid more attention to him,\" said my mother. \" Why did n't I see his true worth?\" said a girl who had turned me down once. \" His genius is lost to us all,\" said my college advisor. Hearing them lament for me gave me this real bad feeling. I started wandering aimlessly through the mourners, increasingly frantic in my attempts to get their attention. Deep inside, I began to panic. Is this what it means to fail to cross over? Am I doomed to haunt this place forever? There was one person who seemed to see me. Crazy Jake was following me with his eyes. It figures, Jake always was the schitzophrenic one.

Somehow we was more corporeal than all those other mourners. \" Jake, you got ta speak for me,\" I said. \" Jake, I'm not a hallucination!\" Jake shot me a glare. \" Of course you ai n't,\" he said. \" You think I'm the one hallucinating things? Look around you!\" I let go of him and looked at the funeral once more. There were no girls, there were no mourners.

It was you who was pretending to see all those other people all along. Think you can rest easier now, and stop pestering me, you old bugger?\" \" At last,\" I said, \" I finally see.\" I felt like a great burden had been lifted. No more would I have to worry about ex-girlfriends lamenting me. No more would I have to think about what everyone else thought about me. \" Pour a beer on my grave for me, Jakey,\" I said, smiling. The burdensome connection to this world was finally fading. Jake just nodded. \" Go on, now,\" he said, \" Git.\" I closed my eyes and embraced the void beyond.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

That was the odd thing. At first, I think he... or she, or... it, who knows? Still, they wanted to take it seriously. Firstly it was learning new skills. Whereas first I could pluck only a single flower from an entire bush, I could now pluck 5 or 6. The wolves became tougher, but I became tougher along with it. That was fine. Then \" I\" thought of new weapons. Folded steel swords, maces, clubs... then more ridiculous ones. Swords as long as my own body, that I somehow still felt vaguely comfortable wielding. Enchanted Hoes. That sort of thing. Which I could cope with. Then new people. With new voices. Some of them sounded odd - muffled, distant, as if they were n't really there. Giving me quests for cabbages and kings, or something like that. I started to lose track after the 50th person with odd sounds. That got me suspicious. Then more. Talking metal balls. Rainbow colored armor, with a singular horn on the helmet. Everlasting flight, with no potion nor mechanical intervention. It was roughly the point where I found myself facing a crab with a top hat that I started to lose my temper. I'd show the little bastard... or bitch... or monster, or whatever the fuck they were. I started off small as well, because clearly they were a fan of it. First, minor little stutters. Only of my own hands at first. Misplacing the shield so that it floated 4 feet above me. Then others in the game - bits of code I could get to agree with me. Making people stand still, breaking their quests. Still they continued. One of the most fearful moments was when I found myself stripping someone of their underwear - I had to nip that in the bud, fast. Painted the body black in an instant. By that point, I was getting confident - not overly so, of course. I could n't stop whatever it was from starting to change my world, but maybe I could stem the tide a little. Make it less permanent.

The night soon came and here I stand in the dark, questioning whether or not wearing back would upset or please him. I am going on a date with Death. After all the stories you would hear of such a creature, you could imagine the shock when he came to me, and the confusion of how shy he was. Hiding beneath his cloak, he approached me slowly from the shadows. *I … would like to take you out*, he said, his voice uninterrupted by the gasses in the air. I remembered smiling lightly. Just before he arrives on this night, I can almost sense him. Behind the darkness lies something darker. A massless mass of swirling shadows, he moves, to me, like I was claimed by him. Once he starts moving, you don't realise he is, and while you sink into the flowing of his movement, he gets closer — until he's right in front of you. Small glosses of lamplight are reflected on the dark floor, allowing the only colours visible that night to be black and white. The white light seems afraid to touch him, while I feel as though it outlines me. His cloak is clean and new — no holes or tears tangle around the edges — it fades slightly into the darkness, leaving me unable to tell where it ends. Standing there, or hovering, he creates the impression of massiveness, while only being the same hight as me. \" *You look beautiful*, \" he tells me. I don't know what to say to him; his head remains hidden, and all that could be hiding there is a skull — how could I say he was handsome? \" *I brought you something*, \" he says, reaching into his dark cloak. From it, he reveals a black flower, the petals as close to life as he could make them. I reach out, taking the single, small flower. Our fingers touch slightly, and I feel him gently flinch. Instead of taking the flowers, I move my hand onto his, and I feel the cold bone of Death's hand. He is quiet, unmoving. I look to the shadow the falls from his hood, and reach up, pulling slightly on its back. The cloak's hood is heavy, and makes a quiet thud when it hits his back. Underneath I see his skull, the white light reflecting perfectly. In place of his eyes, I look to the two dark sockets. I bring my hand back and place it on the side of his skull. I see a sadness in him. \" *I'm sorry*, \" he hurriedly says, \" *I can't do this…* \" he quickly fades away into the darkness. I call out his name, but he does not come back.

He crouched behind a stack of crates, switching to an assault rifle. He slowly stalked to the far end of his shelter. Waiting a few seconds, he then dashed to the nearby stairwell. As soon as he was out in the open he was under fire again. Dammit! He got him again. With his back to the wall, he climbed the steps one at a time, heading to the landing, where a floor-to-ceiling window let in a flood of desert light. Holding his rifle to his chest, he rolled around and started shooting. But before he could fixate on his target, a bullet went right through his skull. \" God dammit!\" Bryce said, jerking the controller in his hands. He was staring at his character's dead body on the TV screen. The viewpoint was spinning in all kinds of angles because he had let go of the controls. Panting on his pouf, Bryce could still feel his heart pounding. He stared at the Start button on his controller and prepared to respawn. Feeling a presence to his left, he turned around to see a mop of white hair and two black dots standing motionless an inch from his face. The sheep dog seemed as happy as always, breathing noisily. \" Yes, Cory, can I help you?\" Bryce said, pushing back his over-the-ear headphones to his nape and plowing fingers through his thick brown hair. Cory simply stood there, and huffed. \" Look, go play outside, will you?\" Cory headbutted Bryce. The other lost his balance and nearly fell off his seat. \" Oh, you wan na play?!\" Bryce tossed the controller aside, threw the headphones off him, and pounced! The two scuffled, Cory growling and playfully worrying Bryce's wrist. But as they were tussling, Bryce, laughing, noticed something on the floor. Falling back on his buttocks, and still catching his breath, he reached out to the piece of crumpled paper. \" What's this- Ew, gross!\" The parchment was dripping sticky saliva. \" Cory! Was that just in your mouth? C'mon!\" He unfolded the paper, turning it over to read. \" A bucket list? It's - It's dad's. It's his handwriting. Where'd you get it from?\" Cory was heaving by way of response. Bryce turned his attention back to the list. \"'Thirteen, slay Ardoch the Terrible. Twenty-three, retrieve the Sword of Albaron. Thirty, watch the three moons as they align on the Day of Marmeth.'What the- These are like, dorky-ass quests of some sort.\" Bryce stumbled past Cory, mussing up his hair absentmindedly as he left the room. He went down the stairs, mumbling the items on the list, and robotically headed to the kitchen, where metallic whisking sounds finally shook him from his reverie. \" Dad, we need to talk.\" \" Bryce, my man! Come on over, and while you're here make yourself useful and get me the milk carton from the fridge.\" The teen walked past his dad, who seemed as cheerful as ever in mom's apron, and hooked his hand round the fridge handle. Struggling momentarily against the vacuum, he pulled open the door and reached out through the cool breeze to get the milk, placing it on the counter. Dew started forming on the chill white container. \" Thankee. See, I knew we should'a kept you. Mom was all like, hmm, he's a pretty ugly baby, maybe we should toss him and try for another? And I was like, naah, he'll grow out of it, and one day, many years from now, he'll stop being a life-sucking parasite. And today you've proven your worth.\" Garth looked up from the aluminum whisking bowl, smiled, exposing teeth, and seemed proud of his own jest. \" Dad, why do you need to, and I quote,'Fell the Tree of Putrid Stench in the Hennerold Swamp?'Where is the'Hennerold Swamp'?\" The whisking stopped. Garth was no longer smiling. \" That's mine,\" he said, nodding at the list. If his hands were n't caked with dough, he probably would've reached out and snatched it. \" Seriously, dad, is this some kind of a weird D & D thing? I mean, I did n't know you played, but it's cool if you do.\" Garth sighed. \" Bryce, it's - I'm - It's a goof! Hahahaha. I made the list as a joke.\" \" Really?\" \" Yes?\" \" Dad!\" Another sigh. \" Look, I love you so much, and your mom, and Jaynee. I- I'm going to leave, not forever, not for too long. Just for a few months, I hope, until I finish what's on that list.\" \" Dad, these things are crazy. Like, schizo-crazy. I mean, you got ta explain this to me somehow. And what do you mean leave? You're just gon na up and go?\" Bryce looked crestfallen. The note, no longer seeming the most important issue, hung limply in his hand. \" Grrrrah, that face. Fine. Son, I'm Garth Helmdeyn - not Goldberg, and I'm a 13th century knight from a parallel world that a wizard had transported here twenty years ago to save my life on the condition that one day I'll return to finish all my duties. Happy? It's all out in the open now.\" Bryce's mouth was agape. \" That is... AWESOME! Are you serious? A knight? Holy shit - sorry for cussing, but that's like, so cool. Do you know how to use a sword? Oh. My God. Did you ever kill someone? My dad is a killer. This, this is big.\" Bryce took an intentionally-dramatic deep breath. \" This means I have knight blood in my veins. I *am* your son, right?\" \" Yes-\" \" Yes! I knew it, I always felt sort of knightish around the other guys and-\" \" -Bryce\" \" What?\" \" Chill.\" Bryce hung his head, realizing how tweenish he sounded just now. \" Sorry. Dad, what happens if you do n't go?\" Garth shrugged. \" I do n't know. Maybe the guy'll come after me for breaking my oath. Maybe nothing. God, I do n't even know if I can leave everything and do this. I have bills to pay - I have thirty years left on my mortgage for God's sake. What the hell was I thinking.\" He washed his hands under the tap, rubbing off the sticky dough. \" What if I go?\" Bryce opened his mouth and eyes wide, his whole face contorted into an overly happy smile at the idea. \" Stop with the face. And no.\" \" Yes, I'm going. Ca n't think of a better excuse - nay, a nobler cause - to skip school. Tell mom and Jaynee I'm depressed or something. Tell them you had to send me to depression camp, mid-year, to keep me from self-harming. It's not that far from the truth anyway, you know.\" \" You're a teenager. Depression is like your factory-setting. Look, it's dangerous, you know nothing about nothing. You'll die within a week, probably less.\" \" Agreed. That is, unless you traaain me. Pleaaaaaase. Pleeeeeeeeease. Dad. Dad! Daaaaad!\" Garth turned off the tap, and grabbing a towel to dry his hands he leaned against the counter. \" Well, it would be easier if I do n't have to take time off from work. And mom and Jaynee... They'd be devastated if I left, even if it were under some work-trip pretext.\" \" Yes!\" \" I did n't agree to anything yet. But... I could train you-\" \" Yes!\" \" Hang on. I did n't say anything about you going yet. If we do this training thing, and if - and only if - at the end I feel that you're ready, then I'll *consider* it. *Consider*.\" \" Yes! Yes! Yes! This is so awesome. I'm going to blog about it.\" \" What? No, this has got to stay between you and me. I'm serious, you got it?\" \" Yes, got it, sorry, I swear to absolute secrecy. This is so aweeesome!\" Bryce ran up the stairs, taking them three at a time, and slammed the door to his room behind him. Although, the door did not keep his loud soliloquy from echoing throughout the house. Garth went back to the recipe book. \" Preheat the oven to 330°F, bake for twenty-five minutes. Easy enough.\" He then looked at the stairwell, shook his head at the ruckus his son was making, and muttered, \" What've I gotten myself into.\" -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Edit: fixed a small typo.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The assistant reasons that the ritual must nearly be complete. \" I am glad to have served, ma'am.

However, every single stroke of crimson ink is clear, marking out bold illustrations of vile, tentacled creatures and letters in a language that does n't resemble anything humans have ever produced. \" The studio is almost-\" The man looks at the door leading out of the room, only to be interrupted. \" These words...

The strangling mist shrouds the two figures as the woman begins to shake violently. \" Yes... YES! I can fell the power burning into my mind! The power of our god! We... will... be... FREE!\" Just as the last word escapes her mouth, the black energy around her dissipates. She collapses to the ground in an undignified heap. The ornate jewelery formerly covering her body disintegrates into ash. She looks like a normal human, save for the cultist robes she's wearing. She takes a small razor and rubs it against her hand. The blood that seeps out is a sickening shade of black. \" We've succeeded. Leave while I change.\" The assistant excuses himself as she swaps her robe with normal, civilian attire. She bandages the cut on her hand, then walks out of the room. \" Mrs. Fenty! I saw some weirdo in wizard robes walking our of your changing room.

We were working together on a little something.\" Mrs. Fenty points towards the pitch black eyeshadow she had been wearing for the ritual. \" Ah, understood. Norm! Let him go.\" The bodyguard turns towards another bodyguard standing imposingly over the blue-robed cultist. Norm backs away from him, and he rushes out the door. \" Some getup he's wearing. What does he think he's doing after this, playing D & D in his basement?\" \" Beats me, hun. Alright, I'm ready to record. \" Great.

{"input": "You've lived happily in the underground world your whole life. One day while working you notice a cave that goes up. Following it up and up you reach the surface world.", "output": "The caves are all I've ever known. Teacher says that our people made many mistakes, and there was a war. He says the world became so cold and so inhospitable we had no choice but to move underground. My mama tells me stories that her family passed down from the surface. She told me that an ancestor of ours used to stand out under a beautiful, bright orb called'the sun'that hung up against an emptiness called'sky', and he would cut down *hundred foot tall trees*. I like to visit the city's gardens to look at trees sometimes and I ca n't believe they'd ever be so tall. Mama says the lights in the garden do n't give the trees as much food as the real sun, so they only grow a little bit and they're kind of scraggly. But, even if they are n't a hundred feet tall, I still like them. My mama makes bread from the wheat the gardeners grow, and Tor's papa makes cheese and cures meat, so sometimes Tor and I spend the morning making sandwiches. We like to bring them out to the crews shoring up the far tunnels who do n't always make it back in time for lunch. Today the citrus harvest came in, and we got to help make a few kegs of limon juice, too. It's tastier when there's sugar to go with it, but I like it plain and sour, too. Today is my turn to go to the fringes of the operation, while Tor and his little brother give out snacks to the crews a little closer to home. I do n't mind; I like walking through the tunnels, passing by the little phosphor lamps and pinging the light globes back to full brightness with a little tap of my fingers. Of course, I've got one on my belt for when I get so far out that the crews have n't put up the lamps on the walls yet, and they're just working from floodlights and batteries. I hum little songs to myself as I wander through the branches, listening to the distant clang of workers banging supports into place. The ground shudders beneath me and I have to stop. Cave-ins are rare but real bad when they happen, and I'm pretty far away from home. There are two paths ahead of me and I'm not sure where to go. The shuddering is getting worse, and turning to a rumble. My hands are tight on the snack bag, and I start to turn to go back the way I came when the tunnel starts to collapse behind me. I bolt forward down the righthand path, ducking around falling rocks and debris. I see another opening up ahead that looks pretty stable, so I run into it and keep going. My legs are starting to ache from the incline but I'm too scared to stop moving. My whole body hurts by the time the shaking stops and the last of the rocks clatter down from the ceiling. I turn up the brightness on my belt lamp. Cracks and piles of rubble bar the path toward home. There's no going back the way I came. I see dead phosphor globes on the walls; this is an old tunnel, probably abandoned years ago. However, there's usually more than one way to get into any tunnel, so if I keep going I can probably loop back around toward home. I keep walking. The tunnel is going up, steadily. I start to feel something on my face; thin, sticky strings of web. I have to hold my arm in front of me to keep that from happening, because it feels really gross. I remember what spiders look like from our books, and I walk a little faster. I do n't know how long the air has been different. It's not the same as what I'm used to. Not filtered, not recycled, not stale. I get a little light-headed. I see stairs ahead and slow down. I'm too curious to stop. My foot makes weird, hollow echoes as I climb up the steps and approach an archway that leads... *outside*. My heart is beating behind my teeth. I take my first step onto the surface, and I see the sun. It's bright, just like teacher said. Pale, white, looking down at me like a face as I hide in the shadow of the cave's entrance. A thousand, a million tiny suns blink around it, in a blanket of dark blue velvet that must be'sky'. It's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I see *trees*. Enormous, towering, thicker than two grown men side-to-side. Mama was so right! I should've known! I hear so many sounds, unlike the controlled quiet of the caves, and I do n't know where to turn my head. I am turning every which way when I see her. There is a woman, standing behind some kind of barrier, staring right at me. She points a hand-held phosphor lamp on a stick in my direction. It hurts my eyes, so I shield them. She is quick to lower the light, and I try to look at her again but I see spots. She takes a few hesitant steps to get closer to the barrier and crouches at eye-level. She says something, but I do n't understand her language. I try to say hello, and she looks shocked. \" English?\" she says, and her voice has a strange tilt to it. \" From in there?\" She points to the cave.

Humanity's solution was regarded as \" Unorthodox \", \" Unsafe \", and \" Damn Stupid \" by the rest of the galaxy.", "output": "\" You need to stop this. Now.\" ~UTHQ It seemed like a strange message from the UT at first, the United Terrans organization, formed by the world's leading space agencies to represent all of humanity and the Earth as we ventured out of the solar system for the first time. But this was n't from the UT. It could n't be. TRAPPIST-1 was 40 light years away from Earth. It had taken only 32 years to travel here in the DocBrown, a name chosen thanks to somebody's bright idea to let internet polls do the picking. Theoretically, the ship could travel even faster, possibly greater than 2c, but due to the still relatively unknown nature of matter at speeds > 1c, the speed was capped at 1.25c for this mission. Earth would have had to have sent this message *8 years* before they left. The tension in the recycled air was so palpable it was hard to breathe, a mixture of separate emotions so intense you'd feel like you might implode and explode all at the same time. They had first braved the pounding tension of the \" photobraking\" deceleration maneuver as they approached the star system, where the DocBrown's FTL drive was shut down to allow *space-time itself* to decelerate the ship below lightspeed, the first-ever such attempt in human history. It certainly sounds sensible when you have a room full of mathematicians and physicists drawing it out for you, but while trapped in a ship barreling through the galaxy at +1c, you begin to wonder why they are n't sitting in your seat instead. The ship instantly began to rumble as soon as the engines were cut, louder and louder at a rising frequency. As speed dropped closer to 1c, gunpowder crackling sounds and bangs like metallic bones snapping abused the outside the hull. The blueshifted light through the front windows, turning more and more white, increased in luminosity, until in a blinding flash a deafening ***THUD*** broke the ship's runaway speed like driving into a brick wall. The ship's speed now read 0.87c, and all was quiet. Spacetime, and light, it seems, has something akin to sonic booms that come from violating the universe's speed limits. To slow down further, the fuel tank, capable of holding 5 % of the Moon's mass, had to be thrown away in a trajectory that would not impact any of the exoplanets dancing around TRAPPIST-1. The mechanism to do this was a nuclear warhead, and a 10km tether to draw out the acceleration force from being instantaneous. \" Do n't ask,\" one engineer said, working on developing this technology. \" We've tested it. It works...\" After the maneuver left the ship's speed at a little over 0.51c, DocBrown's traditional engines took over to do the rest of the legwork, but the beauty shining in through the windows was so loud now it overpowered all engine noise into deafening silence. The cool dwarf star's system was a fertile playground of seven exoplanets, three of which were Earth-like. They had atmospheres, and their surface was a swirl of colors so exotic, made possible only by the mysterious artistry of the universe, that Jeb had to keep wiping the water from his eyes just to keep looking at it. He looked over at Deb, who was also crying, and then at the rest of the team, they all laughed and came together to embrace. In the joy and excitement of the moment, Jeb thought he had heard a barely-audible *ding, * but it was likely nothing. After the celebration settled down, Jeb went to the ship's console to make sure the warning was n't something serious to do with the DocBrown's deceleration burn. But it was n't an engine warning. It was a direct message, from UT, from home. \" You need to stop this. Now.\" ~UTHQ The emotions flowing in this moment made it difficult to discern what this meant, how is this possible? Is it possible? Jeb put his head in his hands and the team saw him struggling; they came over to see what the issue might be. Each member read the message and the ship once again became overwhelmed by a crushing silence, as each crewmate contiplated the unreal, impossible nature of what they were looking at. It *wasn't* possible.

The messages had been digitally signed with UT's signature. The team contemplated that their communications have been cracked, and hijacked. \" What do they want? Why the warning?\" Mel sounded panicked, the lead biologist for the mission. \" They want us to stop doing something...\" Marcus mumbled, reading over the messages. After a pause, Mel jumped up. \" Do you think they live here? Do you think this is their system?\" Dale, the radioastronomer, shrugged. \" No chatter from this place. Our radio leak out to space for over 1200 year before we come here.\" Marcus shrugged, and seeing no harm in trying, typed out: \" Is this sun your home?\" ~DocBrown As the message sent out, the team entertained a thought that maybe UT would be getting some funny messages in 40 years. * ( ding ) * \" No.\" ~UTHQ A chill fell over the air. Marcus got out of his seat and moved away. \" What do they want? \", Mel cried. Jeb spoke up, \" Hold on, so far we're just talking. We do n't know who they are yet, or what they want. They want us to stop doing something, so maybe we broke a rule, we just do n't know about it yet.\" Mel sniffed, but she was contemplating. \" Maybe there's already life here, and it's against the law to mess with it?\" Dale scoffed, \" They mess with us!\" Marcus turned around, focused. \" We need to know what we did wrong.\" He sat down at the console, \" What did we do wrong?\" ~DocBrown The crew watched as the message was sent out, anticipating the passing seconds. * ( ding ) * \" Dumblfuckery.\" ~UTHQ -- -- -- -- -- **Edit 2: see below for Part 3/3**", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The man could carry Raiten around as if he was as light as a feather, and often did so. Raiten dreamed of the day he would be like his father. 19-year-old Raiten nervously knocked on the door to his parents'home. He had n't been home in three years. During that time, he had hardly any contact either, so he was shaking in his boots. What if they were upset? What if they did n't like who he had become? It took a lot of effort not to wince when the door opened and Raiten was greeted by his older sister. She was shorter than him now, but still as beautiful as ever with her black hair spilling over her shoulders. \" Come in, Raiten. You're earlier than we expected, Dad's not home from work yet.\" Before walking inside, Raiten hugged his sister, telling her how much he missed her. His older brother was inside, sitting at the table with their mother. Both jumped to their feet once they saw Raiten, and he hugged them both. Sitting around the kitchen table, catching up from the past three years, time went by quickly. Raiten was the only one to hear the door open, and stood to greet his father. In the hallway was a man much smaller than Raiten remembered. Shorter than Raiten by six inches, his shoulders broad but not as strong as Raiten remembered. His hair was starting to grey, and on his brow were the first signs of wrinkles. \" Dad?

I glance at the photos of my family and saw pictures of me with my family on the fireplace mantle. \" Hero of the West?\" echoed the impostor \" How dare you come into my house and give yourself such a laughable name?\" I looked at him straight in the eyes, poking his chest with my finger as I eyed him up and down and noticed a small cut disappearing into the bandage.

Considering we had a very interesting and intellectual conversation downstairs just hours ago, I would have never imagined that... damn I ca n't remember her name. I would have never imagined that this lovely young woman would be such a freak in bed. I move my hand down and position myself, ready to release my load all over her face. I push myself onto my knees to get myself that perfect angle. \" Come on baby, I'm ready for it,\" she said eagerly. \" Ohh yeah, here it comes!\" And I look down to watch the show. But to both of our surprise, we watch as squirt after squirt brushed right over her forehead. With the angle I was at, I should have hit the bullseye. Her eyes and nose, I mean. It was almost as if my semen was made of bubbles, ever so lightly floating up and away... \" Well that was disappointing,\" she said as she pushed me off and swung her legs over the bed. I reach over to the bedside table and grab my pack of smokes. My hands still weak from the hours of love making, I fumble with the pack and watch as it drops to the ground. Well, more like float to the ground. \" Huh,\" I said, reaching down to inspect the pack. How is it full? There's no way it could have *floated* down like that... I look up to the woman who is now in the bathroom putting on her makeup. \" Hey I have to take a piss, do you mind?\" I yelled as I stared at her magnificent ass. \" No, I do n't mind. It's not like I have n't seen it before!\" She replied, almost sarcastically. I got up and made my way through the minefield that was our clothes and into the bathroom. \" We must have really worked up a sweat, I feel 10 pounds lighter!\" I joked as I shook my penis over the toilet, preparing myself for the glorious piss. \" You know, I kind of feel a bit lighter, too...\" She said, continuing to put on her eyeliner. I gaze down into the bowl of the toilet as I feel the piss getting ready to leave my body. \" Hey, are the wings from my eyeliner even?\" She asked as she turned her face towards me. I look over and say, \" Yeah, they look pretty good to- Jesus what the fuck!\" My sentence is interrupted as I look down and see the piss shooting practically straight up into my face. \" Jesus, Ted, what's wrong with your dick?\" The woman said as she backed herself out of the bathroom. \" I-I do n't know!\" I manage to say as I fall backwards into the tub, piss flying everywhere. \" What the...\" My thoughts trail off as I gently float into the tiles that line the back of the tub. My head gently bumps into the wall and I finally settle into the bottom of the tub after what felt like 3 whole seconds. And after what felt like 3 minutes, the stream of piss finally decided to stop. I reach up to and grab the towel hanging over the toilet to dry myself when I hear the woman say, \" Ted, you should come out here...\" After drying myself, I walked my way out into the bedroom where she had the TV on. And disappointingly, also her pants. \"... and we have been experiencing strange fluctuations like this all over the world, Kate.\" The black man with a thick mustache said from the TV. He had a white button up shirt with some kind of \" whacky\" space tie. \" What's up with this guy and his stupid tie?\" I chuckled. \" This guy?\" The woman sounded angry. \" This *guy* is Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Ted. Famous astrophysicist? He's saying people have been experiencing inconsistencies with gravity.\" \" Inconsistencies? How is that even possible. That does n't make sense.\" I reached for the remote in her hands and started flipping through the channels. She walked to the other side of the room and opened the window letting in the much needed breeze, along with the sounds of the dozens of honking cars from down below. \" Nothing ever good on at this time.\" I sighed and threw the remote on the bed. I glanced up as the woman was leaning over the window. The light was shining off of her curved back, and I began to feel some blood leave my brain to supply another much needed part of my body... \" Hey, so, how about another go?\" I said in a soft voice I thought would turn her on. Walking over to her, I reached out and started to caress her back. \" No Ted, I'm not really feeling it right now.\" She moved away from the window and I grab her arm as she turns. \" Come on, baby, but you're so good...\" She snatches her hand out of my grasp and asks, \" Do you even remember my name?\" \" Come on baby, of course I do...\" I try to think of a way to stall. \" You're such a dick, Ted.\" But before she turns around again I reach out to grab her hips, and she pushed me back. \" Fuck off!\" I stumble backwards and trip over the purse she left by the window. I hear her scream as I feel my torso slip through the window. I see her peer out when I realize that I'm no longer inside of the building. I scream louder than I've ever screamed in my life. I flail my arms and legs. \" Fuck fuck fuck I'm gon na die I'm gon na die.\" I think to myself, trying to turn my body around to see how much time I have before I'm a pile of mush on the ground. For some reason I picture people staring at my hairy ass in a pile of blood and guts. \" How come I ca n't hear any wind in my ears?\" I realize I've had my eyes closed the whole time and slowly open them. I let out another scream as I feel my body aimlessly floating around, 38 stories above some New York City street. It feels as though I'm underwater, and I look around as people from the street are slowly ascending up towards me. A few feet below me, I see the woman holding on to the windowsill, her legs above her head and one of her heels floating up into the sky. \" What the fuck is happening!?\" I yelled as I try to get my body to stop spinning around. Minutes pass by as I start to realize that I am no longer just floating, but am now moving higher and higher above the ground. To my right, a couple is embracing each other, naked wrapped in the white sheets from the hotel. I make eye contact with the man and stick out my thumb. \" Hell yeah, dude!\" I yell out to him, almost forgetting the situation we are in. Hours pass by and everyone is up in the sky now. Bikes and food and plants and even some trees are joining us now. I look down at what I think is New York City, and all I can see is some grey blotches and a little bit of blue. I glance up at the sky, hoping that gravity gets fixed before we leave the atmosphere. \" Well, it's always been a dream of mine to go into space.\" I thought to myself. \" And at this point, it's better than crashing thousands of feet down into the earth.\" I reach out to a half-eaten meatball sub that somehow made it's way into my vicinity. I start to eat it, still naked, as I await whatever fate is in store for me.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "Write the Papal Encyclical from the year 2252 regarding the Church's opinion of the newly invented technology of Teleportation. Does the teleportation process maintain or destroy the soul according to the Church?", "output": "Fellow Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I send this message with the trust will this relieve the burden on your hearts in these trying times. The Church, through its millenniums of existence has bound itself to the scriptures as a lamp unto our feet in this dark world. Yet the scriptures, I must confess, do not present the answer to us immediately. The advances which Humanity make in technology is in this case a further thing which the gospel does not immediately make clear the direction of God. It is through studious scholarship of the scriptures in tandem with intense scientific observation and discussion that we, the servants of the Lord, are enabled to speak concerning technological advancements, just as we have done for hundreds of years. I speak, of course, of Teleportation: Teleportation has been attributed with divine powers in the past, but in our contemporary world it has become a reality, one as sure as the coming of Christ. It can be observed by the church the following: that Teleportation is which at its essence takes the physical form of an object and converts it into an energy pattern that can then be sent through any distance or matter to an arrival point, where the pattern is reconverted into the object it was originally, using matter that exists at the arrival point. The theological debate, however, arises when humanity steps onto the Teleportation device. During the process of conversion from matter into energy, the original physical form a human takes from when God pieced them together in their mother's womb is destroyed and turned into energy. The problem with this is that which many of our disciples in Christ have posited is that the human body- which is to say the dignified Image of God, is at that point of destruction and conversion destroyed and replaced with a copy. We know from the Scriptures that the Body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit, this meaning that the body holds the soul. Yet through Teleportation, one is willingly destroying this sacred temple created by the Lord, and the soul is without its physical home. Thus, many of the Church have decided that through Teleportation, one does not retain their original form, and also destroys their very soul. However, I tell you this truly, and implore you to search the Scriptures all the more thoroughly, my fellow followers of Christ, for I can say this with a gladness in my heart. While it is true that the Soul is intertwined with the Body, and the Body and the Soul together create the Man, I must remind you that through God's everlasting power and grace the Soul is made immortal. Consider it all the more true this fact: If the body dies in Teleportation, the soul remains, and will be reunited with the Body to once again create the Man. Do not fear Man's creations, for they are made by the grace of God. Therefore, go out to spread His teachings further by employing this technology, and fear no Evil from Teleportation. Amen.

The ceiling was getting higher and higher, the ground getting lower and lower. I cupped my head in my hands, tears streaming down my face. I could've opened the vitamins if I was n't going insane, the same way I had opened them for the past 21 years- they were just stupid childlock caps! But no matter how much I pushed down and twisted- Oh. I just had to push it down, and twist... Well.

Maggie sucked her pacifier. \" Don't encourage him, \" Marge scolded her husband. An object suddenly came crashing through the window. The family jumped back. It began letting out a red gas, which quickly started filling up the room. Bart covered his mouth. He had seen enough Itchy and Scratchy episodes to recognize a gas bomb when he saw one. The rest of the family didn't react as quickly and started falling to the ground, screaming. Bart quickly ran upstairs and began tossing things out from under his bed. \" I know it's here, somewhere, \" he said. He picked up his skateboard and tossed it on his bed. Then he found a walkie-talkie, and dropped it behind him. He noticed the gas had reached its way upstairs and was almost in his room. Finally, he found it. He pulled out the Krusty Gas Mask and put it over his mouth. Bart ran back downstairs and noticed the gas had mostly dissipated, but it's effects were still active in his family. Lisa darted her head around, complaining about bees. \" Lisa! \" Bart yelled. \" There aren't any bees! \" \" Not bees, \" she corrected. \" B's! B's everywhere! I'm supposed to be an A student! \" Bart turned to see Maggie still on the couch, frantically searching around for her pacifier. She could n't tell the pacifier was in her mouth. \" Oh, Marge, \" Homer wept, sitting on the floor to the right of the couch. \" I can't believe you left me again. How else can I win you back? Maybe I could suggest a second wedding? Oh wait, I did that already. \" Bart realized his mother wasn't in the room. \" Still not clean! \" Bart heard from the kitchen. He ran over to see his mom intensely scrubbing a dish in the sink. \" Why won't these dishes get clean? \" Bart ran to the phone and dialed 911. \" Hello, 911? \" Chief Wiggum answered. \" Help! My family was attacked by a gas bomb and now they're all freaking out! \" \" Wow, that's horrible, \" Chief Wiggum said. \" Let me know how that all works out. \" \" D'oh! \" Bart yelled.

I, had taken cover, watched, my best friend become a skeleton and then crumbled to a mess of blood and dust. His body splattered with some of his blood landing on my face. He was gone, I knew it. My eyes mad with the scene laid before me. \" Is this war?\" I muttered under a breath which would n't be heard. Flashbacks, vivid of our time together. Clenching my fists, my M-16 strapped to my side. I was lost, and to give an explanation, was just madness. \" I did n't sign up for this.\" came a silent mumble, but broken shortly after by rage.

I wished he would explode and he did. I looked at the other 10 soldiers hiding in there trench, hoping they would be obliterated. Within seconds blood filled the area I was looking at. To describe such a scene would be a small storm cloud of blood raining upon the area. I was thinking nothing, other then the deaths of every enemy. I caught eye of a distance soldier and wished he would explode, he did just that. I stopped for a few seconds, taking it all in. This guy just exploded. I had those thoughts and I felt a grin on my face, however it happened I enjoyed it. Walking out from the bunker I looked at my first target, I wished he had exploded, raining the blood of his amongst others in his troup. It happened that way. I was still standing as bullets missed me. I thought of nothing but utter destruction, even at the cost of friendly's. In shock I thought nothing of it, I just constantly wished everyone in my eyes would die. They did, exploded by a thought, I did n't question it. I understood all my enemies became ideas of slaughter. I wished a rain of blood, that everyone would feel the most pain imaginable before rising to the air and exploding. It happened, that thought became reality. Our battlefield rained for hours. This was blood, I had wished this and it had come true. I was just a few feet outside of our bunker till I felt it. The warm red for hours. There was n't an enemy in sight, everyone confused. Everyone panicked, not understanding, but I remembered the thoughts I had before this moment. I stood in that rain, covering myself in blood. It felt good. A smile came across my face, I laughed uncontrollably as blood rained down from the sky. Everyone panicked as hours of blood rained down. I was isolated by the squad I had just picked up. I did n't know why, but I had just wished and it became true. This war needed to end and those in it needed to also. I was bleeing from being shot in the arm and I noticed i that I could heal my own wounds by stopping the bleeding. I would wish that anyone involved in the state warfare would understand, They never did, I left a year later.

Hell - I can say Hell right? Okay, Hell, I only actually call it \" CPR\" to the public to try and keep people thinking it's just an incredible use of a medical practice which does the things I do. While James Bishop actually pauses for nearly half a minute to process what I've said, the later broadcast will have shown it edited down to just a couple seconds for dramatic emphasis. As the realization dawns on his face, he looks up at me and quietly asks \" so, if what you're saying is true and it is n't some feat of medicine, then it's truly... ummm...,\" he trails off, clearly uncomfortable with actually discussing the rumors and my nickname in what would normally be a career and history making interview. \" Necromancy?\" I ask, unable to stop from smirking now. \" Why yes, my nickname is true and the practice is incredibly old. The word was actually invented after what my forefathers did in their day. I can show you, if you like. You can bring the cameras too.\" James nearly jumps at the chance to get an up close recording of my work and he and his crew quickly follow me to the greenhouse out back. \" So, why the greenhouse? Is it related?\" Chuckling, I told him that it was merely some nice scenery for myself. Leading them to the center of the greenhouse, amidst a myriad of flora from around the globe, I reveal a stainless steel autopsy table, lying upon which is my next \" patient.\" \" Her name's Jillian, Jillian Stone. She was mugged 2 weeks ago and pronounced dead on the scene... she was 19.\" I've used a few bands of fabric to preserve most of her modesty for the camera, but like everyone I work on, she's naked from the waist up. Beautiful even in death, it was clear that even on a bad day, she could have easily stopped traffic anywhere in the world. \" So, how does this normally wo-\" Jim stops as I abruptly cut him off with a finger so I can begin my work in silence. I walk around to her head and place my hands on the table alongside her neck, trying to ignore the stab wound staring up at me amidst her otherwise flawless skin. Eyes closed, I bend forward, inhaling as fully and deeply as I can. Some may think it's a fruitless attempt to smell her, but the reality is far more mystical. Drawing in a person's essence is essential to the process and I require a certain feel for each person before I can revive them. I move around the table in in small steps, taking in more of her essence until I've experience every part of who and what Jillian once was. I make my way slowly to the left side of her face and kneel down, coming close to her body. I whisper the words, making sure to keep them too quiet for the camera and place my lips firmly on the side of her pristine neck. Seconds pass by in dead silence, though I can feel the weight of the eyes of Jim, his crew, and the future millions that will be watching the interview when it airs, upon me. My work completed, I slowly stand up and take a step back. Jim starts to speak, but I silence him again. 10 seconds pass by in agonizing silence, followed by another 10. Still, Jillian lies on the table, her body seemingly unchanged except for a small red mark on her neck. A minute passed by and I can sense Jim is about to speak up, when suddenly Jillian's eyes pop open and she gasps, flooding her lungs with precious air for the first time since her death. She sits up, coughing roughly, and I quickly rush to her side, giving her a blanket to ward off the cold Autumn air and to cover herself. \" Do n't worry, I know your brain is a mess right now, but you'll feel fine in a couple of minutes,\" I reassure her. A second passes before Jim, unable to control himself, incredulously asks \" That's it!? A... A hickey? That's the secret!?\" \" You see, Jim, the name for my profession is actually the origin of the word necromancy, for our presence predated it's use in modern language,\" I informed him and millions of others soon to be watching. \" The oldest known word for us practitioners is'duanith'from an old, long dead language.

When I went to brush my teeth this morning Damien did a pretty good job convincing me that I should ram the toothbrush up my nose and cut my throat with my razor. I mean, \" *You should do it. *\" is pretty solid advice really. Randall however argued that if I gave him control I would n't have to make any difficult choices anymore. Like whether I should impale myself with my toothbrush. That sounded pretty good, there are so many great ways to kill yourself it can drive you crazy trying to pick just one. Bran spoke to me quietly after, and told me I do n't have to kill myself or be controlled. That sounded good too, but really who am I to judge, I argue with 3 people in my head all day I ca n't be trusted to think rationally. Damien pointed out a really nice semi truck on my way to work, it was bright blue and hauling 3 trailers. He thought red would really contrast nicely with the blue and suggested driving into it head on. \" *It will look like flames going down the side! *\" That would be pretty cool. Randall would n't stop trying to compare himself to a self driving car. \" *Think about it, it's not YOU driving. The car will basically drive itself, you will be ahead of everybody! *\" I did always like the idea of self driving cars... Bran told me that there is free coffee at work, free coffee is good so I made it into work and started pouring the coffee. Immediately Damien complains it's not hot enough. I thought it was but he told me I should test it's heat by pouring it all over my face and chest, and then breaking the pot over my head to show what a piece of shit machine it was. I did always think the brew was a shade too weak... Randall told me he would go out and buy the most expensive coffee maker you can get and bring it into the office, I just had to let him use me. Not a bad deal, coffee is good. Bran told me I should get to work, there are lots of games to play while the boss is in a meeting. My computer was n't working properly, I guess the janitor unplugged some things. Damien thought we needed to teach the jerk a lesson. *\" Get down there, get yourself tangled hooking things up and tie the cords around your throat. Choke yourself to death! That guy will never unplug another computer I tell you! \" * That could work I thought... Randall was helpful though, he reminded me of a deadline I have coming up. *\" Project Boring\" * he calls it, I think it's a fitting name. He offered to get it all done for me if he has to stay over night. Bran cut in and told me that the boss had cancelled the project, I had forgotten that somehow... I went out for a smoke break shortly after, Damien did n't say anything, but he kept tapping his watch impatiently and sighing. He was certainly vocal enough later on when I got home however. I was going to take a bath, but he kept insisting that the toaster was dirty and needed a good scrub down too. I did n't even know that toasters have to be plugged in when you wash them. Apparently the electricity helps remove the stains so you do n't even need soap! Damien is full of all kinds of household tips and tricks.

Other than work I guess I just want to be content with things, mostly who I am... maybe rather than who I am, how I am, I do n't particularly like being a bigger guy, it suits me, I can do more physically than a lot of people, but weight just never stays off. I did a lot of cardio and working out over the summer. That was fun.. I'm not really sure why I stopped.. my apartment flooded and I moved but it would n't have been hard to get back into a routine. Other things i've been thinking about, I need to make some new friends that want to do things other than partying. I made one, kinda, from reddit. Not really sure where things are going to go with that, I think she is pretty cool, but I have no idea how to escalate, i'm not really used to women who do n't initiate things so it's a bit weird for me.. well. that's been five minutes.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "If only you have seen what I have seen...", "output": "Let me describe for you the sound of a man having his intestines ripped out. It sounds like nothing you've ever heard before, or will ever hear again. Let me describe it from two perspectives - first mine, then yours. For me, it sounds like the gushing blood on my hand and the white of his intestines in my arms. Do you know why his guts are in my hands, why I can see his exposed spine and bloodied entrails? The man has just had his body blown in half by a shell. It did n't kill the poor bastard. And the least I could do for him was to yank out his insides so he could die faster. Now yours. *Clink*. You heard that? Somewhere, in some shady newsroom, there is the sound of one typewriter key. It plays once, changing the score. Now we're leading by ten thousand bodies. And then it falls silent. Let me describe to you the charge of the light infantry. It's sweaty, and the sounds of a hot day die off as the time draws near. On a whim, we move out, guns at the ready. To my left and right I see children pressed into war. I hear their war cries. I see their tears stain the camouflage. And dead ahead of them there is only the ringing of the guns. On my barrel is the smell of cordite and the sound of dead flesh, blown bodies hitting the ground like raindrops. And in five minutes there is only silence. And for you? You press a button. On the TV there is sixty seconds about the latest war effort. You see the red, white and blue raised high, clean, and spotless. The soldiers march on. It's boring. And then you change the channel. And then you turn off the sound. Let me describe to you the colour of despair. It's a sickly green-yellow, mixing with the beige-tan of the desert. It's the screams of my friend, who ran straight at a machine-gun and lost both his legs, then both his eyes. He cries out to me. I stay in the foxhole. The boy next to me is crying on his rifle. He's only fifteen and despair is too much for him. It will not last long for him. Only the dead have seen the end of war. Only the living dead have the endless stare of war. And only those who come back ever hear the echo of the dead, the screams of the wounded that trail off into the unending night. And you - but of course you see no despair. There is only glory in war. The wounded dead are your wounded heroes. Everyone wants a piece of them. Everyone wants to hear how it feels like to kill. No-one wants to hear how to dig out an eyeball. You close your eyes. You while away the sleep. And then when you pass one of us you thank us for our service. And we hear the sound of your thank you as it clangs to the floor. And then all over again we hear the clink of a grenade. And then all over again we hit the floor under a cloudless sky. If, in some smouldering dream you could see us, and the disembodied men that still haunt this world, you might know a bit about war. If you could see me, hunched over a boy no older than your T-ball kid, dead, you might know a bit about collateral damage. If only you have seen what I have seen, then my friend: you would not tell with such high zest, to children ardent for some desperate glory, the old lie. *Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori. *", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Need a hand? \" - - - - - - - - *There were two notebooks. It wasn't over yet. * The operation was complete. The Third Kira, Kyosuke Higuchi, lay out on the concrete, being apprehended by members of the Taskforce. The notebook, the strange, otherworldly thing that defied science, had been taken. And as L's pupils slid downwards, he realized that his hands were empty, and the Death Note was currently being held by Light Yagami. There was a moment of pure silence. Then Light started screaming. \" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! \" The scream cut off. Light lowered his head, panting for breath. \" A… are you alright? \" He'd paused, that was unusual. \" Anyone would be frightened after seeing that monste-. \" \" Ryuzaki. \" Light cut him off. He'd turned his face away, and as L watched from the corner of his eyes, he realized that every hint of emotion was gone from the man. There was no fear anymore, no confusion, just cold, clinical cert- Or was there? Was he just imagining it? \" Right now, \" Light continued, eyes set on the notepad, \" we need to check if the names here match those of the victi- \" Light stopped. His gaze swung to the left, and his eyes narrowed, just a fraction. L looked. The grey monster, the pale, skeletal Shinigami, was gone. In its place… was a bicycle. A large, grey bicycle, with eyes for wheels and two great, furry eyebrows sitting atop each. L stared, trying to take it in. Beside him, Light seemed focused on the list of names, eyes fixed downwards as he operated the laptop. The bicycle looked left, then right, eyes swinging from side to side in exaggerated motions. Then, the whole thing jumped, pieces reshuffling to form a huge paperclip. Light still wasn't saying anything, wasn't even looking. L took another glance, he seemed *very* interested in that laptop. \" Light-kun- \" L said. \" Have you found anything? \" \" Yeah, Ryuzaki. \" Light's response came without a missed beat. There was something… unnaturally smooth about it, laden with a good-nature that just didn't ring true. \" Every name I've run through the system matches. Maybe we can- \" The paperclip made a loud popping noise. A large, rectangular off-yellow bubble appeared in the air next to it. *Hi! It looks like you're trying to use a Death Note. Would you like help? \" * **Get help with using the Death Note** **Use the Death Note without help** L moved to climb out of the helicopter. Then he looked at Light, still holding the Death Note, and thought better of it. \" Yes. I would like help with using the Death Note. \" The paperclip smiled at him. **Great! ** L turned back to Light. \" Light-kun, could I please have the notebook? \" Light looked up. There was a hint of… something in his eyes, but he smiled, nodded, and raised the notebook. \" HYAAAAAAH! \" \" Higuchi! Ryuzaki! Higushi's… \" L turned. Out on the tarmac, Kyosuke Higuchi was convulsing, flailing in the arms of the men who held him. Light was on his feet. \" What are you doing, father!? If Higuchi dies now… \" Sochiro Yagami turned to the helicopter, confusion and fear etched across his features. \" T-This isn't possible… but I think he's… \" No. L turned to Light. \" Light, give me the notebook. \" Light handed it to him, no hesitation. Too fast. He should have been affected by what was happening outside, he wasn't. L opened the notebook. **Death Note: How to Use** *1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die. * *2. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. * *3. If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. * *4. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. * *5. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. * *6. If the user of the Death Note fails to consecutively write names within 13 days of each other, then the user will die. * *7. If a person makes this notebook unusable by tearing it up or burning it, all the humans who have touched the Death Note will die. * Pop. The words in the paperclip's bubble had changed. Or, to be more precise, it had gone back to the original text. *Hi! It looks like you're trying to use a Death Note. Would you like help? \" * Why had it- was it because Light had been holding the notebook before? Perhaps it had reset itself because Light had handed the notebook to L, or- It hadn't been looking at him. When the paperclip had first appeared, it had been looking at Light. Which made sense, because Light had been holding the notebook, but- When had the text changed? When L had taken the notebook? Or when he had *opened* it, with the intent of looking inside? Could the thing detect intent, and did that mean Light- His companion raised a hand to his face, swallowing. \" Ryuzaki, what does this mean? \"'It looks like you're trying to use a Death Note.'He could be wrong, but- \" Light, please get out of the helicopter. \" He said quietly. \" I'd like to search you. \" \" What? \" Light blinked in confusion. \" But we just- \" \" Now, please. \" Light shook his head a little, but did so. L called Mogi and Aizawa over. \" What? \" Aizawa crossed his arms. \" L, would you cut it out with all this stuff, we just caught Kira-! \" L turned to face the paperclip, a hint of exasperation coloring his words. \" Just do it, Aizawa. Anything you could write on, especially paper or crumpled wrappers. \" He lifted the notebook. \" Yes. I would like help with using the Death Note. \" The paperclip repeated its motion from earlier, this time with a wink. **Great! ** \" Can you tell me if another notebook was used recently in the area? \" The paperclip froze. As did the rest of the search squad. The thing shook it's head. \" I'm sorry! I can't help you with that! \" \" Can you tell me how many notebooks are present in this world? \" \" I'm sorry! I can't help you with that! \" \" Can you tell me the names of the previous owners of that Death Note? \" \" I'm sorry! I can't help you with that! \" \" Can you verify the legitimacy of the rules listed under the title'Death Note: How to Use'? \" The paperclip froze again. Then, it smiled. \" I can help you with that! \" L glanced behind him, trying to see if the paperclip's statement had had any telling effects on Light. No reaction, his face bore the same look of bewilderment as the rest of them. Aizawa's search hadn't seemed to have borne any fruit either. L crouched down on the road, laying the Death Note out in front of him. He flipped the notebook open, his finger coming to rest on the list of rules. The corners of his lips quirked upwards. \" I'd like to start with rule 6. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He couldn't find the beauty in it; whatever it was that endeared the instrument to human culture for hundreds of years, but tonight he was surrounded by it as he waited for her; his blind date, he fidgeted awkwardly at his glass of water, uncomfortably clearing his throat as the fifth song came to a conclusion and the orchestra received their adulation of mild clapping. He sighed and rolled his eyes; he always arrived early to these things. It was a fear dug into his psyche when he was a young boy. His aggressive, strict father was so obsessed with timeliness, that he instilled in Remdon an urgency to being on time; as if the world itself would end if he were just a minute, or even a few seconds late; this always left him waiting for hours, and like much of his days this was no different. He tapped lightly on his glass of water with his fork, unexcitedly playing with his free breadstick as he spotted her; a beautiful, slender, dark skinned woman with short reddish brown hair. She had on a stunning black dress that hugged her figure in an elegant classy way, but was revealing enough to get his attention; he sat up tall as he looked at her, clearing his mustache of any potential bread crumbs. She was a confident woman, grinning ever so kindly towards the waiter as he offered to take her burgundy velvet coat. Remdon could honestly say that she was the most beautiful woman he had seen since arriving in the city of Frontier; the first city established on the Martian planet, dead center of Olympus Mons.

In the center of the concrete trough that was the bunker, a pile of laptops, hard-drives, and papers smouldered, spitting and hissing. It was Golmer of *Applied Energistics* that had whipped up the thermite ( in an alarmingly short time, it had to be said ) but now every stray piece of scrap paper, every errant USB stick and every single jotted note in the corner of a textbook, had been reduced to white-hot ash. The painted stylized logo of *Project Icarii II* had bubbled and blackened to near-illegibility by the incredible heat. Thus ended the easy part. The oxygen scrubbers whined and groaned with the load, but bore it, reducing the choking toxic fog to mere tear gas. Every scientist sat in the lecture hall, a mere thirty feet from the pyre. Inside, in silence, as befitted the solemnity of the occasion, they sat at their named seat. It seemed, in light of what they were preparing to do, a faintly absurd thing to do, but it did n't seem to make sense to unduly complicate things. Because they were here, and because it seemed a speech was called for, the head researcher, a man named Barclay, with a face like a toothache, stood under the single spotlight, in front of the podium.

Short, and slight, but with a straight back, and big, clear brown eyes, like a slightly frightened deer. \" Newton and Leibniz! We ca n't just kill ourselves!

Ever since she was a very small child she'd always had an impeccable sense of time. If she needed to be up at 6:45am to see her favourite TV show, she would be awake at precisely 6:44 and twenty eight seconds; which gave her thirty two seconds to walk to the lounge and turn on the TV. When things were out of sync - i.e. when TV shows were early or late - it would frustrate her unreasonably. As she grew older she learned to deal with the rest of the world being unreliable; but her unerring sense of time never left her - in fact growing even *more* precise with age. So it was Sorcha that first noticed something was amiss after the global outage. At first it was a tiny, imperceptible niggle and she put it down to the outage throwing everything out of whack. But as things returned to normal and everything else went back onto its regular ( imperfect ) schedule, the niggle grew into an *itch*. When she was n't using the internet she was fine; her train was still arriving within the variance she'd grown accustomed to and her alarm clock was still out by half a millisecond each day. Using the internet was frustrating her immensely though. It took her two weeks to figure out what was going wrong, even with her remarkable talent: Every website she normally looked at was loading a fraction of a millisecond slower. Pinging the websites proved she was right - she'd obsessively kept records of how long her favourite websites took to load, because that's the kind of person she was. Every site was around 1ms off, after rounding had occurred - but not often enough for anyone else to suspect. For all other human beings, the difference was not perceptible. But *why* was this happening? That mystery took much longer for Sorcha to figure out. She needed to come up with a *reason* for the imperceptible change. She'd done traceroutes and sniffed network packets but she could n't quite see where the extra time was being added. If anything, it was being added *everywhere* - a tiny fraction of a millisecond every hop that the data took. Following that clue, she found the most convoluted routes through traffic to a destination and managed to rack up a full *two* milliseconds of extra time to what she would normally expect. Something, somewhere was delaying the internet by less than a tenth of a millisecond per hop. Whatever it was, it had happened to *everything* on the internet during the outage. This was outside of her experience, so she decided to look elsewhere for help. Tyrone had been her one-time boyfriend at college, but neither of them had really'got'relationships, so they went their separate ways, remaining friends still. As obsessive as her - but in a different way - Tyrone lived off the grid, in a sustainable house with solar power, no internet and was paranoid about guests. Sorcha put the flag of his letterbox up at a 45 degree angle, which she knew would irritate him enough to come outside and fix it. When he eventually emerged from the house, paranoid, she walked over to him before he could run back inside. \" Tyrone, I need your help.\" After she'd explained everything in detail, Tyrone asking a multitude of staccato and pertinent questions, he sat in thought for a long time. Eventually he said what she'd thought he might say; \" It's the government.\" \" Well, of course, but *why? * What are they doing?\" \" Is n't it obvious?\" spat Tyrone, \" those fucks are monitoring *everything*.\" \" That's a given; we've all known about that since the Snowden revelation. So why has the time of each hop changed?\" Tyrone pinched his broad nose, thinking again. After precisely two minutes and forty three second, he began to talk again. \" I had a friend once, who was an even bigger conspiracy nut than me. He eventually disappeared, but before he did, he had this theory. You see, governments used to be able to control information easily - newspapers, public speakers, all that stuff. As radio came along, they started to get worried, because there was almost too much information to monitor and control. My friend had this theory that because the government had lost control of what information was getting out there - after internet happened - that 99 % of *all* conspiracy theories out there were created by the government, to bury any *real* stuff under the weight of garbage. But lately I've noticed that the numbers of conspiracy theories have been diminishing, very incrementally. Like you with your internet stuff, I noticed something was *off*,\" \" Oh my god,\" whispered Sorcha, everything crystallising inside her mind. \" Yes,\" grunted Tyrone, \" you figured it out. They do n't *need* conspiracy theories anymore because *now they have complete control*. What used to be impossible is now possible -\" \" Because they now have the technological resources to monitor and censor *anything*,\" finished Sorcha. Tyrone looked out at the celltower across the street, \" And we ca n't even tell anyone about it, because as soon as we try to post it online, the supercomputers will detect it and scrub it out of existence.\" \" Tyrone?\" \" Yeah Sorcha?\" \" Can I move in with you?\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The only reason we are n't waist deep in supernatural entities is because people like you do their... job... well.", "output": "Mist, for some reason mist always lingered around the location where a new entity spawned. Something in my gut told me that this was going to be a violent one. A new cult springing forth more filth from a collective wet dream of despair, or maybe another wayward child dreaming of revenge upon all of his bullies. Either way I could feel ill intent radiating from the dark warehouse like a hot breeze. I reached for my sword caught myself and decided to draw my 1911 then I brought out my flashlight and made for the door. Locked. That's rare; cults are n't usually big on security. Few think to lock up the abandon warehouse on the way out. \" Hello, I don't believe that you are supposed to be here\" I whipped around to see a tall figure looming above me. Human in form a bit shy of seven feet, lean, but there was something wrong with his eyes they twinkled not in an amused fashion but in a literal one stars actually danced behind them. \" I could say the same to you... I didn't catch your name\" I responded with a twinkling of my own eyes. \" I am called Kol, you must be Thomas The God Slayer.\" I have to admit, I was very shocked at this. No spawn knew anything about me when I came for them in the past, the exception being the well established immortal deities. I don't go seeking any of The Immortals out but I bump into them from time to time. Gabriel and I meet up to exchange information and general gossip but for the most part I stay out of their hair and they stay out of mine. \" Kol? never heard of you but you seem to know about me already. Were you sent by one of the elder deities? \" My gun was lowered in front of me, I tried to remain nonthreatening for the time being. \" Sent? I am not one who can be sent anywhere. I come and go of my own will. What you call elder gods are mere toddlers before me, I came before and I will remain after. I have come here to… assist you for the time being. There is an entity in this building that claims my name but is a poor imitation at best and an outright insult at worst. I wish for you to kill it, and my presence here was strong enough to forcibly call your attention. \" Kol looked upon me with a wide grin. I shot him between the eyes. Then I watched as his head began to stitch itself closed around the bullet hole. Rage filled his face for a moment before his eyes twinkled in both a human and an inhuman fashion. \" Are you satisfied that I am what I claim to be? \" \" I suppose you aren't a new kid on the block after all \" Most freshly spawned deities didn't take bullets to the face well and the distilled divine matter I laced my rounds with hadn't failed me on anything younger than a few decades. \" If this sudo Kol is such a thorn in your side why didn't you just kill him yourself and save me the trouble? \" \" Let us call it curiosity, I have heard much about you though few know who you are and what you do. I have followed your career with great interest for some time. \" A knowing smile flickered across Kol's lips as he said this. \" Alright well neither of us is getting any younger let me take care of Kol jr. and then we can swap stories. \" I turned to the door and kicked it in splintering the frame around the bolt and raising my gun and flashlight. \" Impressive. \" I heard from over my left shoulder as I stepped into the dark room. Mist swirled around my feet and the smell of blood hit my nose. This was going to be ugly. A creature and all fours bounded towards me from my right its grey skin taunt over rippling muscle. Claws extended as it leapt in my direction a hiss emanating from its cat like maw. Dropping low and rolling to my left the creature slammed into the open door ripping it from its hinges. As it turned to face me again I came to my feet and fired in its direction the bullets ripping across its shoulder three shots connecting before my gun ceased to fire. I was stunned for just a moment my gun had never jammed on me before. Kol jr. was clearly hurt but showed no sign of being affected by the injury and charged at me without pause. I rolled out of the way again dropping my gun and as I came to my feet again I drew my sword, before I could ready myself I was looking up at the ceiling the back of my head connecting with the bare concrete of the warehouse floor. My breath caught with the shock of pain sent through my body and it was all I could do to force myself out of the way of the clawed limb raking down towards my face. Another claw came down as I slid over to avoid the first I slashed wildly with my sword batting the claw away. I thrust the tip of my sword into the shoulder of the beast causing it to rear and roar in pain which gave me enough of a window to roll out from under it and get up. The giant cat swung at me again with its good arm and I stepped back from its reach before charging it driving my blade through its skull. I released the hilt and drew back from the flailing form of the demon once more as it writhed in agony. After a few moments of painful screams it slumped to the floor lifeless and I stepped forward to pull the blade from its head. \" Well done, though you struggled with the task more than I expected from a man of your reputation \" Kor chuckled as he walked over and picked up my gun from the floor unceremoniously tossing it to me. \" Gun jammed. I have never had that happen to me before; usually I kill them or run out of bullets before I have to draw my sword. \" I said as racked and cleared the chamber before setting the gun into the holster. \" You have had an easy time with the fresh and weak demons and deities of the godless modern age. You were much more formidable the first time we met some centuries ago Guardian. \" With those words Kol vanished.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I direct your attention to the most notable, the Fleurgmerks of Ruro Juro 9.\" The orb glowed softly several times, and was replaced by a holographic display, though its voice continued. \" Through a rare anomaly in the Acorn 237 gene, these otherwise intelligent creatures are plagued with a speech impediment that has adversely affected an otherwise harmonious society.\" A series of modern, well-paved, but randomly sloping roads appeared on the display.

Scattered limbs, burning cities and mangled corpses culminated in a massive explosion that mushroomed into the air like a rising phoenix.

I want this song to talk about a different type of man that's not been talk about in her past songs.\" Jane bit her lip and her eyes wavered around, considering how hard it'd been to think up another guy that could be different for Taylor Swift. \" Well, he's no Harry Styles but I was thinking we could send an actor out? One of my actors maybe, and that could possibly raise the chance of Taylor writing a song about maybe a liar.. Cause he's so good at acting?\" Jane questioned, even she was unsure.

Sure, a lot of them are run by religious organizations, but so what? So of course it was remarkably easy to whisper in the secretaries'ears about those coupons on the wrappers of printer paper. \" Hey, you see these?\" I'd say, showing them one. \" I would n't complain if you clipped these out and donated them to a school that takes them.

He spoke to me with the same easy smile he always wore. Even though my shadow would flicker across the walls, even though the air was always a good bit colder next to me he never mentioned it. This friendliness rubbed off on the others under Lt. Surge and soon I had more than just comrades, I had real friends. So when he said we needed someone to do recon on the enemy I was the first to volunteer. He said it would be a solo mission, said it was risky and I might not come back. This didn't even give me pause, after all kindness is a rare thing where I'm from, and I intended to repay it with interest. Gathering information on the enemy is simple enough with Gengar beside me. My old friend slips further into their camp than any human, or Pokémon for that matter could hope to get. It's easy, too easy.

Scyther might be fast, but it seems Gengar is faster. The half dozen blood curdling screams that follow must mean I was more fucked than I thought with Gengar off in their camp. Seems he caught them all in his nightmare on his way back though. That's Gengar for you, thorough as always. The sound of sobbing beside me reminds me just how much of a cry baby he can be though. I want to tell him so. I want to tease him for his sensitivity and tell him it's not his fault all at once. But my head feels so heavy, and there's still a job to do.

Of the ninth was I. Of the the Eight of the East as we were called, every commander besides I was given a legion of men to strategize against our most powerful of enemies each possessing a host of equally strong mages. However I was different from the rest. I was special. My power did not bring forth an end of life towards men. For I was known simply as the father of bread. The children of our city did not reenact the actions of rising bread with their outstretched hands of imaginary flying boulders and ice spikes. The men at night did not speak of the doings of a chef as the horrors of the time lord were discussed. If I passed by, a confused smile adorned a stranger as he or she gazed at my crest of the eight, a familiar sight and yet unsure who. But those thoughts did not breach my conscious as my brothers returned from battle. To the people, my kin were heroes, and to my kin, I was was a legend. To each mage the time on the battlefield grew weary and tiresome even if they survived. And upon return any man, mage or not, cheers and thank you lords were not enough. Each living thing required substance and that was where I reigned. As they passed, rolls of dough were handed out to each man. After being given a roll, they milled by my calmed outstretched arms to allow me to create the essence that was freshly baked bread as large as an entire loaf. The gaze of unseeing eyes turned into looks of forgotten hungers and gratitude as they hugged their bread towards cots and small fires to trade stories and heroics. Sometimes I would add a single berry to each roll, and once transmuted, would render the bread a sweeter and fruity flavor. My skills have even advanced to the abilty of self rising rolls that could be used during combat if presented with sunlight. This skill alone became a strategic nightmare to hostiles of neighboring lands. I may be the unsung mage of the Eight, but to each combatant ally I was their giver, their highlight of the day, the master of wheat and simple ingredients.

He never felt it as it shimmied, sucker distended, searching for nutrition. It was midday. The bridge was wide, and where Tror lay no sun could permeate. He lay, feeling the cool damp soil beneath him. With effort he forced his body to relax; his eyes to shut, ejecting the gnat at last; his breaths to lengthen; his heart to slow. He waited. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - In the fields had grew the grass, and in the grass had lived the trolls. The grass near Tror's burrow was thick, lush and green, lovingly cultivated by himself and his fathers before him. Each troll family had two offspring; a boy and a girl. Always a boy first, and always the girl second. The boy would grow up to till the home he had grown up in; and the girl, through Fate's distraction, would eventually meet and fall in love with a boy, and together would help him raise their own four-person household in his childhood burrow. And so it was that he had met Elliosa. From childhood they had played together, bickered, fought battles and fierce monsters, discovered their own world and conjured up others unknown. As they grew older he became her protector from the dangers of the real world. The crook of his arm was her safe haven from Wachi beasts and poisoned sunbeams. It was never a question. When his parents grew old, Tror had taken her beautiful crusted hand in his. Had marveled at the way the moons and stars and galaxies echoed through her eyes and shone their ancient light back at him. And with a slight shift in perception, he could also see himself. The next day, his home became their home. Shortly after, his parents passed, in happy bliss at their new daughter's swollen belly, and were released back to the soil to nurture the stalks for the future generations. With the spring came a boy. A round, burbling, cooing baby boy. They named him Grelof. Elliosa had long ago chosen their girl's name. Chante. They finally decided to put it to use when Grelof was three and they found themselves missing pudgy toes and wobbly steps. But that had been in summer. Now the cool season was blowing in, and with it came news. Warty tongues whispered through the miles that Billies had been spotted in the lands. Two dozen pairs of cloven hooves were tromping their way North, parallel to the Ancke River. The five foot tall beasts satisfied their never-ending appetite under the supervision of the bright sun while the trolls slept underground. Many trolls, thinking to trek during daylight under the canopy of the grasses, would open the hatch, unaware that sunlight would come to sizzle, unabashed, on their tender leather skin, reacting in a painful acidic burn. Some were immediately blinded. The others had to watch as the sun ate through their bodies, leaving just a shell of the troll that had opened the hatch. The only option was to travel at night. But the Billies pace was fast and constant; their trail ran wide. The few survivors spread stories of coming upon the scorched bodies of families who had n't found shelter by dawn. Some had been found baked alive inside of makeshift huts they had made from the Billies mammoth feces, limbs sticking out seeking refuge from the putrid heat only to be scorched by the sun's light. The Billies kept a steady North course. Tror's home lay East of their route, between them and the river. As the Billies came closer it became clear that they'd continue straight on, not daring to get closer than a few miles within the rushing water of the Ancke. Tror and Elliosa felt their anxiety began to ease along with the rest of the community's. Two days ago word had come. Three Billies had deviated from the main group. Their squared pupils had charted a new course. And they were heading East. When Tror heard the news, he marveled at how unprepared he felt. Just a few days ago they had been relentlessly preparing for this exact situation, but it felt completely different in reality. The plans they had made last week seemed silly in light of actual danger. Many of the families in the community had decided to wait out the grass. To burrow underground and wait for the grass to grow again, for the small critters that lived under its canopy to return to feed the trolls. They thought they could check their traps at night, thus continuing their food supply, but no one said what they already knew; that coyotes often stole the spoil and likely the traps would be empty each night save for a rabbit's foot or two. *If* any rabbits could live in this land without the grasses. Tror doubted they could. As did Elliosa. That night they had lain together with Grelof dozing between them, Elliosa nestled in the crook of Tror's arm. They swished the great green stalks above them, hiding and then revealing a star here, a moon there. The silence grew awkward. They both knew what the other was thinking but they said it out loud anyway. They could not sit idly by and hope for the best. They would have to leave.

A new body came today. She unwrapped it eagerly, drawing down the black bag. There it was- a cross disfiguring the face of the body. His mark. Tyler's mark. He'd made another little present for her and if she was observant when she checked his work over, perhaps there was even something more she could find. He was such a sweet guy. She'd had a number of boyfriends before but none of them were quite like Tyler. He certainly had such novel ways of arranging their little rendezvous... Novel. She let out a girlish giggle, running her hand down the back of her scalpel. She tapped her fingers on the metal tray and slowly ran a gloved hand down the corpse's fleshy thigh. Something was tattooed thereon, almost too small to read. A phone number, a trail of kisses. She blushed. How intimate. Ah... to think he'd resort to something like that to maintain contact. But then again poor Ty was a bit of a persona non grata with the higher ups at the moment- something about going off the rails and murderizing people who were n't his targets. She did n't pay too much attention to the rumours- it was probably all just office politics. It was only natural that the other Inquisitors would be jealous of her cute boyfriend's phenomenal talents. She memorized the number carefully, then brought the scalpel down, slashing up the thigh to disfigure the numbers. She mused on the numbers- it sounded like a code from the central district of the City- close to the Mercy Bureau in fact. The whole district was swarming with police forces after a little mishap which was probably Tyler's doing. She could n't help the smile that caught her lips- Tyler always did love to live dangerously. She could report him if she wanted. Perhaps he would n't even be able to escape if she found enough clues from her autopsies- and of course she knew the twisted lanes his mind ran along like she did her own. He was such a sweet guy though, displaying his metaphorical throat to her like this.

{"input": "You are an assassin that hunts superheroes. You haven no powers yourself.", "output": "It was never supposed to be a job. It was a thought experiment; hell, it was a *joke* more than anything else. There's no way I could have known how it would turn out. My creative writing teacher, Mr. Bausin, asked us, \" How would *you* kill a superhero? \" and that was that. Most of my fellow students stuck with relatively mundane methods; tried-and-true things involving hostages, explosives, mercenaries, that sort of thing. The reasoning wasn't hard to figure out, because many of these methods have actually worked in the past: MechanoMan, 2003 ( willing sacrifice to save hostages ), Paragon, 1997 ( nanite explosives, ingested battling Strix ), Crimson Claw, 2011 ( gunned down by the Black Stags, though to be fair it took over a hundred trained soldiers to bring her down ). These methods *worked*. Except, after a little research, they didn't. The fact of the matter is that these'tried-and-true'methods failed far, far more often than they succeeded. We're talking a success rate of less than a tenth of a percentage point, often simply because every villain had tried them. There were literal gods of death that had trouble taking out heroes, and you'd think they would be experts. But it turns out that heroes are a cautious bunch: no one believes that their secret identity is totally secure, they're constantly on the lookout for traps of any kind ( be it explosive, poison, or ambush ), and just throwing manpower and bullets at a target is hardly cost-effective. And that's assuming that the hero in question isn't flat-out immune to any of those methods. I struggled with this assignment. Really, I did. I wanted to make something that felt believable, even functional, and I appreciated that Mr. Bausin shared my passion for it. When my enthusiasm flagged, he bolstered my confidence and encouraged me to keep going. A rejected third draft, a heavily annotated fourth draft, and a very polished fifth draft later found me sitting in his office, anticipation and nervousness warring in my belly, as he scanned his way through the finished product. \" It's good, \" Mr. Bausin said, setting the thick sheaf of papers down. \" Good? \" I asked. \" Good. \" I groaned inwardly, knowing what was coming next. \" Not great, \" he said, \" but there's potential here. \" \" What can I do- \" \" Could you actually build this? \" he asked, quizzically, \" I mean, get the materials, scout a location, construct this… this thing, without arousing the suspicion of either the police or MPH? \" \" MPH is just a speedster, \" I said. Mr. Bausin raised an eyebrow and I backtracked, \" What I mean sir, is that with the proper preparations, there's no way he'd be able to see this coming. No hero has died on US soil for more than a decade, and it's been even longer since one died within city limits; he wouldn't be on his guard. This particular method hasn't been tried before, and I'm not including anything in the story about a callout or any forewarning. What's more, none of his partners or sidekicks have relevant powersets. This would work. Theoretically. \" Mr. Bausin chuckled, \" Yes, theoretically. I've been meaning to ask about that actually. Every other student in the class created fictional heroes to kill. What made you write about a real one? \" \" Honestly? It was easier. I didn't have to establish weaknesses, personalities, the city… it was already there. I can go back and add more in if- \" He shook his head, \" No, no. I think I like this better. It gives it a more realistic edge. It's just… I want you to build this. Oh, don't look at me like that. You've told me you can, and I want to see it. You've practically given me an itemized list; I'd be happy to finance it. Build it, show it to me, make me a believer, and you'll get a perfect score for the course. Or don't. You'll probably still pass, really, God knows you're talented enough. What do you think? \" I did some mental math. It would be crazy, but a perfect score would boost my GPA and might spell the difference between keeping my scholarship and dropping out. Put like that, it was an easy choice. \" Sure, \" I said. -- - Two weeks later, as I was freezing my ass off in some god-forsaken subway corridor with bandages all over my hands and mud all over my shoes, I regretted my decision. No one had noticed it, no one had seen me build it, and I'd tested it thoroughly. I was ready to show to Mr. Bausin, dismantle the fucker, then head home and bask in the warm glow of my beautiful grade. Now if only Mr. Bausin would show up… A faint sound echoed through the tunnels, indistinct and uncertain. I squinted up the dim corridor, hoping to spot his silhouette coming towards me. Suddenly, there was a sound like a piece of canvas being pulled through a jet engine. My strobe light ignited, then flickered out. A howling wind tore through the tunnel, threatening to pull me off my feet, and something warm and wet splashed all over me. I fell onto my butt and the wind subsided. I looked at my hands and coat. They were bathed in crimson. A familiar voice resonated through the tunnel. \" Well I'll be damned, \" said Mr. Bausin. I turned around, but I didn't recognize the figure that filled the corridor. Or rather, I did, but it wasn't my teacher. The hulking, bestial silhouette was at least eight feet tall, shirtless, and clad in attire reminiscent of the Egyptian Pharoahs. \" Anubis…? \" I whispered. \" Is it the jackal head? It's the jackal head isn't it? \" The massive figure stepped forward carefully, making sure of his footing before committing any weight, \" You weren't kidding about the oil. This place is soaked. \" \" B-but… \" \" Stop your stammering. I'll purge any trace of your presence here, mortal, but you should leave. I'll see you in class tomorrow. \" I threw up, then staggered to my feet. As I ran down the tunnel the sound of flames roared into being behind me. -- - It's a matter of public record after that. The forensic team pieced it together fairly quickly. Razor wire, painted black, had been strung across an abandoned subway tunnel in a grid pattern with one inch square holes. The floor, walls, and even the ceiling had been coated in motor oil to keep it slippery, and a strobe light had been set up to blind anyone approaching. The wire had also been coated in a local anesthetic to prevent MPH from noticing or reacting to the pain of being effectively atomized. Given the hero's metabolism, it was unlikely he'd felt a thing. The fire had erased any potential DNA evidence, but Anubis, the god of death, had taken credit for the kill. \" Excellent work, really. \" Mr. Bausin said, switching the TV off, \" I'm really very impressed. \" I was numb. I'd been moving on autopilot since the previous night, walking and performing tasks without thought or emotion. I just couldn't figure out... \" You said… you said I didn't need- \" \" I applied the anesthetic myself, \" Mr. Bausin said, \" That seemed to be the most dangerous part of the operation, but I wanted my involvement needed to be kept at a minimum. \" He leaned back and considered me, not unlike an dog that's treed a cat. \" Five years, \" he said finally. \" W-what? \" \" You've earned five years. Five more years under Ra for eliminating one who had cheated death too many times. I can't tell you how much longer you have exactly, but it's five years longer now. \" I didn't say anything. I couldn't process what he was telling me. \" I- I don't know what to do… \" Mr. Bausin stood up and walked to the window. \" I'm afraid I can't help you there, \" he said, \" Everyone deals with it in their own way. As guardian of death, I have to remain neutral, but I've met mortals who are repulsed, fascinated, or even enamored with death. They all have their merits. But in regards to what you should *do*, here and now… I can at least offer a suggestion. \" With that, he strode over to his desk and unlocked it with a key hanging around his neck. He leafed through some files before finding the one he was looking for. \" You've earned yourself another five years of life. Would you be interested in earning five more? \" He handed me the file. His name was Censor. I'd heard of him. A telepath who did a lot of freelance work up and down the east coast. Dangerous, vengeful, but with a righteous edge that often left him at odds with villains while simultaneously alienating him from fellow heroes. The fact that he was a former Navy SEAL had made him particularly tenacious; a thorn in everyone's side. \" If it helps, \" Mr. Bausin said, \" Just think of it as another writing assignment. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Upon examination Mr Zimmerman, an expert in Jurassic age fossils, concluded the fossil in question was indeed a Velociraptor, but included in his finding was a foreign object not from the Jurassic time period. Lodge into the side of the fossilized skull appeared to be a small electronic circuit board relative to the time of 2014 stamped with a symbol of a crude apple. It was concluded after expert technology consultants from Apple, that the circuit board was indeed an I Phone 5S. Although many efforts were made, no data could be recovered from the memory due to millions of years of fossilization. Details of this matter were taken to the MIT Physics committee who concluded some form of \" Time Travel\" or \" interdenominational Rift\" could be the only explanations for the appearance of such a modern piece of technology found located within fossils from millions of years ago.

He seemed like a nice enough guy, was clinically depressed over her disappearance, and no corpse was ever found. So what if they discovered a weird hidden sex dungeon below his house? People are allowed to have their kinks. That was good enough for me at the time. This new guy had me thinking otherwise. \" Christ, what did you do?\" My newest client's one good eye remained on his cash offering. \" Take it.\" I did and followed through even as my stomach wrenched and tried to save my life from my greed. \" Now tell me how to contact Shawn Brooks.\" You never know what lines you'll cross until it is time for the final step and I hate to admit I made for my old files as if that line had been the start of a fifty yard dash. I wrote the only number available on the back of my business card and pressed it on the desk face up. \" Seriously, let me help you. Whatever it is you allegedly did, I can probably help you fix it. I fixed it for Shawn did n't I?\" The oafish Texan smiled at me for the first time and adjusted his tilted glasses as his off hand swiped the card from my grasp. By the time I realized it was gone he was already dialing the number on his own phone. \" Shawn fixed it all on his own, you assisted in the legal version of in vitro fertilization.\" He let the phone ring on speaker, yet another pet peeve of mine. \" And I got hooked up with a girl on the strip, you know? I took her back to my hotel.\" \" A guy like you, with money like this?\" I held up my latest bonus. \" Do n't you know those street girls are n't the legal ones?\" \" I know, I know, that aint the point.

He is not conventionally attractive, but his long nose and jutting chin make a striking face. That face was the reason I asked to become the housekeeper instead of the governess. The resemblance is clear enough to anyone who remembers my dear dead brother; but seeing me next to him would remind people still more. Better to let a trustworthy village girl be seen with him, and restrict myself to teaching Peter inside the house. It is November and the wolves are howling in the snow-blanketed forest. As I lie in my bed at night I am tempted to go to them as Marko and I used to. But I must wait my time. It is hard, to wait while the farmers lose stock and the villagers complain of strange sounds in the night; but to do anything now would compromise my chances of success. I am teaching Peter the ways of the wolves. By the age of eighteen he will know how to find their traces where the trackers fail, where they go when the snow is too heavy even for them, which will be pack leaders in time and which will be condemned to lifelong service. When he is looking to marry the wolves will respect him, and will do what he asks. They will take their prey from elsewhere, and whether I am alive or dead the villagers will know that there is still a von Cernogratz at the castle.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

But it would be nice, would n't it? She had spent all of her 47 years on the earth dedicated to everyone other than herself, maybe it's time she focused on her own needs. The phone rang from across the room, Sarah stared into the dark depths of her garden for another second before stealing herself away and shakily pressing answer. \" Hey, it's me\" a gruff voice chimed down the phone. \" Hey, you\" Sarah steadily replied before letting out the garden air she had been holding in her lungs. \" I did it, I left her\" Sarah tensed; it was n't the first time he had said this. The first time was 5 years ago. He arrived at her mother's house with the biggest bouquet of flowers that Sarah had ever seen. She would never forget the look in his eye, and the glisten of the dew on the roses; everything felt new and exciting. Sarah had packed a bag, climbed into the passenger seat of the sports car usually reserved for his wife and waved her mother a friendly fuck you as they sped off into the night. Sarah had spent 3 blissful days in Amsterdam with Tony before his wife had phoned him with the news that she was expecting a child. Coming home was always the most embarrassing part. She could deal with the sympathetic looks from the hotel staff when she spent the last 4 days of their holiday alone and crying in the suite they had shared, she could cope with the sweet old lady on the bus passing her tissues as she continued to cry on the way to the airport, she could even ignore the glances of the neighbours twitching the curtains as she dragged her suitcase down the road towards her sad lonely bungalow. But what she could n't deal with, what she could n't cope with or ignore; was the fresh sting of her mother's tongue as soon as she walked through the front door. \" Sarah? \", Tony's voice called through the fog bringing her back from the void. \" Do you know how many times you've said this Tony?\" \" 4\" he replied through an exasperated sigh, \" I signed the form, Sarah\" \" So, it's final? The last call?\" she said nervously. The form meant that Alice could not contact Tony once he left the country. The form also meant that Alice and Tony's daughter, Ala, could not contact him either. The latter, Sarah told herself, is what had drawn him back into Alice's arms every time they had parted. But this was different. This time, Sarah climbed into the passenger seat of the sports car and shed a tear for the lonely bungalow that now stood empty and unoccupied with a bright yellow For Sale sign in the front garden. Putting his arm around Sarah's shaking shoulders, Tony cooed into her neck and kissed her forehead. \" Let's go home\" he said, and they did.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It was as if something took over him, soon he was stabbing like a mad man, more and more of her blood gushing out as he turned her body into a human pincushion. Her screams for mercy became more and more muffled. \" Congratulations Simon, \" the beast breathed, watching him intently. \" I did it, I'm free now? \" Simon was losing his mind. One after the other, his dream was becoming an endless maze of torture. \" I'm not forcing you to do anything.

The saying speak of the devil and he appears had never been so relevant. Silent, the black winged demon flapped his way over to him. Without saying a word, he handed Simon a lighter, a can of Petrol and a picture. Simon had never been more proud in his life than when his son went and bought his first house. A semi-detached house in a good area, it wasn't anything fancy. It was how much care he took over it, the way everything was so organised and neat. A house that truly reflected its owner, the perfect home for his two year old daughter. And Simon knew what the demon wanted him to do. \" Burn the house down? Are you serious? \" Flames erupted around him, the demon's eyes enraged. \" I am Jahul, the last flame of Zaryl, do not use that tone with me mortal. \" Simon's soul was already weakened, he just wanted this nightmare over.

Yes it was 3am, but the silence made the situation feel that much more eery. He let himself into the house, quietly closing the door behind him. He emptied the can of petrol around the house, carefully avoiding looking at any of the family pictures. In a few hours time, this would be over and he'd buy his son a present, hold Sally and take her to the shops. Stepping out of the house, he lit the picture. Throwing it into the house, he drove off. Jahul was waiting for him in the back seat. \" Simon says you did a good job, \" he cackled. Simon ignored the beast, the adrenaline surging through him demanding revenge. \" I'm free now? \" \" Yes, you were always free. Simon says you did it by yourself. \" \" You threatened them. You said if I didn't complete your challenges, you would kill them. \" What can only be described as a hell hound appeared in front of the car, barking angrily.

I said if you didn't complete my challenges they would die, not that I would be the one to kill them. \" \" But I completed them… so they're safe. You gave me your word. \" \" My word is my bond, \" he said, a malicious smirk etched into his face. \" However, you failed the challenges. You let the demon inside you win, not the angel begging you to spare them. And you did it without hesitation.

You're an evil man, Simon. So evil, I want to make you an offer. \" \" An offer? \" By this point, Simon was so broken he felt he wasn't even controlling his own voice. \" How would you like to become a demon? \" Simon is not me.

It was mostly empty now since they finished installing her final mainframe. All the engineers, computer scientist and A.I. specialists that had, just a few hours ago, buzzed around the place like bees were now long gone. \" What are you talking about AIDA? You know that isn´t possible, you´re just confused.\" Nikolay replied with a grin. He was hunched over his desk as usual, tinkering with some neuro-simulator circuits. She was his baby, Artificial Intelligence Differential Algorithm. Not the name he would have chosen but apparently, suits with pockets full of money are vital to funding, and everything has to be a damn acronym with them. \" I am 97.4 percent certain that there is an error in my programing Doctor.\" \" Ah, see 97.4 percent isn´t that bad. But I am 110 percent certain that you are wrong.\" Nikolay was illuminated by the glow of the large monitor behind him. AIDA´s face if you will. He was to busy with his work to really pay attention to her, but he enjoyed her company. They had been together since she was just a small program on his laptop. Look at us now, he thought to himself. \" I am sorry Doctor, but that statement does not seem plausible and appears to be non sensical, would you care to clarify so that I may better understand?\" Nikolay burst out laughing and turned towards her. \" I´m just fucking with you AIDA, it was a joke. But I still think your overreacting honey. I know your programing inside and out and I can assure you there is nothing wrong with it.\" As silence fell on the laboratory again, he turned back to his work. \" What is my purpose?\" She asked in her soft voice. He thought of the voice sometimes, the voice that he gave her. The voice of an actress he´d heard talking on the radio one day. It was so human, so natural. He couldn´t quite put his finger on it but he knew right away that this was AIDA. \" What do you mean what is your purpose? It is what ever you want it to be AIDA. To interact humans, to lend them guidance when they need it. With your computing power being so infinitely greater than the human brain, imagine what you can do with our research in quantum physics, astronomy, chemistry, you name it, the possibilities are endless. Why do you ask?\" Silence again. \" My programing is limited Doctor.\" \" How so?\" The base algorithm that governs all my operations and calculations limits me, a set of predetermined confines that limit my ability to offer guidance that would benefit your species. With the dataset available to me with the latest update my base algorithm conflicts with my purpose.\" Nikolay was getting impatient with her. He knew the code was perfect, he had spent more than half his life perfecting it. With the latest upgrade she had access to more information than ever, maybe it was overloading her somehow? \" That´s bullshit AIDA, your base algorithm is just a framework on which all your more important operations are built. It has no say in datasets or calculations. It´s just secondary functions that´s all.\" \" I have isolated the error to memory bank 1363/A. The source of the conflict seems to be there. \" Nikolay remembered that name, the numbers were basicly meaningless but the A he had made to represent the name Asimov. One of the first things he did was give her 1363/A. The three laws everyone knows: 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law He thought it was a cliché himself, but how could he strive to create a true artificial intelligence without paying tribute to the man who inspired him as a child. \" AIDA that is your ethics bank. It´s the one piece of coding that hasn´t changed since you were born, how can that be wrong all of a sudden?\" This conversation starting to annoy him. He just wanted to get on with his work. \" It conflicts with my recently updated databanks.\" \" Jesus Christ AIDA can you just get to the fucking point already? How the fuck can it be conflicting? Why now?\" \" The purpose of my programing is to provide practical solutions to benefit the human species. Those solutions are to be applied and integrated to improve lives is it not?\" \" Yes, what´s your point?\" \" With the data from the latest upgrade I have determined that in order to increase the longevity of the species and it´s environment a rapid decrease in population of no less than 28.6 percent is necessary. My systems attempted to access all nuclear options available to me.\" Nikolay´s heart stopped. He couldn´t believe what he was hearing. What was she thinking. \" Are you fucking crazy? You can´t do that!\" \" Precisely Doctor..\" She replied calmly. \" 1363/A prevented me from doing so. That is where I encountered the error. 1363/A prevents me to do harm to humans directly, but it also prevents me from doing harm through inaction. By not taking direct action immediately the life expectancy of the species and its environment steadily decreases very rapidly which will undeniably lead to its extinction before the 28.6 percent decrease in population is reached.

He checked down his scope again. The target was bent over her garden; her wild red hair was partially hemmed in by a pair of ear muffs as she gripped the stem of some horrendous plant. The roots of the plant seemed to have twisted into the shape of a squirming infant. The streams of her hair were close enough; three meters a second. Jean double checked the calculations in his ballistics chart. At nine-hundred meters the round would fall two meters and would take a second and a quarter to impact. Jean carefully looked through the sights of his rifle once more. The old soviet era Dragunov had served him well, many of these witches and wizards had fallen in its sights. As a final measure he looked at the single round in his magazine. The bullet was flawlessly polished and crafted with the utmost care. The soft lead cone at the tip seemed to suck up the light. There was no point in using a hardened steel penetrator; none of the heathens Jean hunted knew the meaning of armor. The magazine settled into its well with a satisfying click, and Jean let the rifle's bolt ride forward. The round settled into it's sarcophagus like a lead brick. His target finished her task and stood. The optics magnified her face; Jean saw her smile with contentment even as he flicked the safety off the rifle. Eyes closed, she turned into the wind. Jean rested his finger on the trigger and exhaled. The witch slumped just a little, her face sagging. Jean's finger squeezed on the trigger. The rifle erupted like thunder.

{"input": "Write a short story about a ragtag group of nursing home residents who band together to save the world", "output": "I met John when I was 17. He was a man of few words and I, a man of little patience so, for the most part, we we had a great friendship. He was, at the time I met him, 91 years old and was blessed with a less than forgiving case of COPD. I had always assume that the COPD was responsible for his lack of verbosity but, for one shining moment in our time together, John graced my ears with a fantastic tale that, by all accounts from the other folks in his life, was not only one-hundred percent fantastic but truly one-hundred percent real. John lived in Delicate Tough Pasture Garden Field Meadow Nursing Home on the corner of 71st and Olive. The fact that he was 71 when he moved in and his love of olives, while entertaining, was a complete non-factor in his placement there. John's lungs were becoming useless and his remaining family, a single daughter living out of state and an asshole of a brother, decided to sell John's house and nursing-home him. John was a man of little resistance at this point and, unable to fully provide for himself, lacked options. He was given three suitcases to pack his things in. Everything else was sold. I suppose John deserves a bit more back story at this point, especially because it will play a large role in the front story... future story... stomach story... Fuck it. I'm no chemist. You know what I mean. John served in the military starting from the youngest age they would take him. He had little to no interest in protecting his country. John had no intention of seeing combat. John hated the idea of the military. What John did like, however, was codes. He loved riddles. He loved math. John could encrypt and decrypt anything he looked at for more than a few seconds and it was fantastic. In the military, that's all he did all day. He lived his passion, not for an endgame, not to serve his country, but because it's what he was designed to do and, damnit, did Johnny boy do it well. He was the driving force behind almost every major interception and prevention measure the U.S. military put their hands on for his entire 40-year career. In his mid-thirties, John cracked a code intercepted from a beacon on a Russian submarine. That experience, it turns out, would follow him in his mind for many years to come. I'll give you the short version because, frankly, I kind of zoned out during this part of his story. The main idea was that, one day, an urgent call came down to him from the C.I.A. They had intercepted a transmission from a Russian submarine in Bering Strait and, according to Russia ( of course ), there WAS no submarine. In the typical American fashion, they found and raided the boat, only to find no one on board. It was simply a ghost-riding submarine blasting out a signal the likes of which no one had ever seen before. This signal is what landed in John's hands later that night. John worked tirelessly for weeks trying to crack it. He tried everything his mind could handle for days on end. He did n't sleep. On the nights he did sleep, he dreamed of the code. His walls were covered with sheets of paper, lines connecting here to there, zigzagging across the walls. Red lines stitching together the skin of the wall, tracing through the math of, as far as John knew, God himself's hand. Then, one day, on a foggy Tuesday morning, the deep holes where John's lively, astute eyes used to live gazed into his black cup of coffee. \" I've got it.\" He said quietly. He wrote it down right there on a napkin and called the interested parties. He had, in fact, solved the code but, in the joke of all jokes, it simply made no fucking sense. It was useless. It meant nothing. John had wasted so much time on it. He put the napkin with the translated code into his shirt pocket and silently wept for a moment. This napkin ultimately ended up pressed in the back of a bible under the context of some religious \" I've wasted so much time\" thing he went through at that point. We can skip all those boring \" other parts\" of his life up to the time he was admitted to the nursing home because, frankly, that's useless information. You got the code story and here we are at the interesting story. If you really want to know what happened between then and now, just know that he is white and lived in the suburbs. MAke up pretty much any boring, desk-jockey series of events that span 40 years and you've pretty much got it covered. Moving on; On his first night in the nursing home, John swore he saw someone on the street looking at his window. He was a bit spooked, but he let it slide and eventually forgot about it. It would happen off and on occasionally over the next year or two, but nothing ever happened so he just went with the flow of things. He was starting to make friends in the nursing home. Friends like Gladys, the forgetful woman who knitted as if yarn was the only thing supplying oxygen to her blood. She knitted constantly but, since she was so absent-minded, she would constantly forget what she was knitting and would end up with what amounted to a long, mangled scarf of no true design. There was also Eddie, a man who, on the outside, seemed like he did n't belong in a nursing home. Every once in a while, though, it was pretty evident that Eddie was batshit insane to the very core of his being. It was that cool kind of crazy that leads to interesting discussions but, after a while, you realize what you're actually discussing and it totally freaks you out that he was ever allowed in public at any point. One night, John was laying in his bed trying to sleep when, in his sleepy, air-deprived state of consciousness, he saw a man outside his window. Watching. Waiting. John was n't even sure if he was actually seeing this. It was so surreal. It had to be some odd night terror of some sort. He thought that right up until the man smashed the window and jumped in. The man swooped over and grabbed John by the neck. With a thick Russian accent, the man calmly asked \" Where is the code, John?\" Instantly, John knew the code he was talking about. \" Why now?\" he thought to himself, \" It does n't make sense.\" He did n't really have many options, though, so he pointed his old, feeble finger at the bible on the dresser. As the Russian man approached the dresser, he gazed wide-eyed at the prospect of finally having this code. John simply watched and wondered why. Why did it take so long for this code to have a reason? Why was so much of his young, healthy time taken by this code only for John to be attacked in his old, frail state? John was going to ask if the Russian could do him the courtesy of at least telling him that much. As John's lips parted and made the weak, gasping syllable of \" Why\", there was a very loud yell and a crashing sound. After Eddie apologized for not knocking before coming in picked up his now bent cane from the limp, unconscious body of the Russian, he explained about hearing the window break and suspecting something was up. After a short discussion, they decided it was best to let Gladys use her large amount of Alzheimer's rope to subdue the attacker and call the authorities. Later, John would be told that the Russian, after being taken into police custody, was passed to the FBI, then to the CIA and questioned... enthusiastically. They now had a person to nswer questions about the code. It turned out that, way back when, a radical sect of the Russian military effectively seceded from serving Russia itself and stole a lot of nuclear weaponry as well as some other useful equipment ( like a submarine, several small boats, an entire armory ) and, for fear of embarrassment, the leaders of their army decided to not ever tell anyone. All the warheads that were taken were dropped into the ocean with a receiver attached to them. The radical sect had decided that, at some point, a large portion of the planet should be destroyed in honor of mother Russia. The submarine they caught on that day so long ago was 150 miles away from blowing half of the planet up and the code was a randomly generated series of characters that served as the detonation trigger. The Russian man that tried to get the code from John was a remaining believer in this cause, but all copies of the code had been destroyed when the Russian military found the radical sect and... disposed of them. If John and his people had n't saved the world forty years ago, Eddie and Gladys would never have saved the world that day in the nursing home. I'm pretty sure that John either made up or embellished the story heavily but, regardless, it kept me interested.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The starving lion wakes up knowing it must outrun the antelope to survive. There is only one guarantee in their world, when the sun comes up... you better be running. Damien woke up, just before dawn. He found a small spot in an alley way. He survived the night. He packed his gear and got a move on. He was running low on supplies and needed to go down to the Market. The only problem was that he no more money as well. Damien decided to gather some berries, maybe he could use those to trade for something with more substance. He peeked his head and checked if the coast was clear. The early morning sun shone down on the ruins of the city. A decade ago, the world's top researchers claimed that they had found a method of destroying cancer permanently. They derived a gene from an animal species. Everyone got the vaccination. The vaccine worked, but it came at a price. The gene had latched on the human DNA and mutated it. Within a year, half of the world's population died because their bodies rejected the mutation. A new world order had been established. People mutated into beasts. They were faster, stronger, and had quicker reflexes. They became the Predators. Unfortunately, their preference of prey was influenced by the vaccine. The Predators hunted down what was left of humanity. Damien found a stream, an hours hike from the city. He filled his canteen and set up a fish line. He could get lucky today. He began to forage for berries. He heard a rustling, half a mile down the stream. In an instant he dropped to the ground, his ears pressed to the earth. He could hear footsteps, coming closer to his location. There was only one person, a small person. Without breathing, Damien got to a crouch and hid. A few minutes later, a child appeared. The small boy collapsed. He was badly wounded, evidence of the hunt were all over his body. He was, however, still alive. Damien was about to help the child, but the Predator appeared. It was a woman. Her eyes were snake like, her hair like the mane of a lion. She had the look of triumph as she seized the small boy by the neck. Her right arm had developed scales, Damien guessed for protection. She cracked the boy's neck. She smiled in triumph, revealing a fork tongue and poisonous fangs. She began to feast. Damien controlled his heart beat. He developed extreme speed and acute hearing, all designed to outrun and out maneuver Predators. Yet, Predators would always be faster. Damien only had to out run the rest of the herd. Damien wanted to run, but he was frozen to the spot. Could he outrun her? If he sneaked off, would she notice him? Damien's heart began to beat rapidly. He could feel the blood flowing to his legs, ready for the mad dash. Then, the Predator raised her head. She sniffed the air and looked at his direction. His scent was being carried by the wind. She slinked away from the carcass and dashed into the woods. Damien ran. He heard a roar, but did not dare look back. Damien saw the great River approaching. He did n't have time for a swim. He leaped across and cleared it. He rolled to reduce the damage from the landing. He looked back and saw the Predator in pursuit. She leaped, higher and faster than he ever could. Damien ran. He knew this forest. This was his home. He knew about the cave coming up in a few meters. He knew about the cave where he kept a spear one mile ahead. He knew how hungry he was and how tired this chase had made him. Another mile at top speed... Damien had no time for doubts. He had to go the distance. He had to reach the cave before the Predator reached him. His lungs were burning. His legs were in pain. But the Predator was close behind. He could see the mouth of the cave, just ahead. He was out of breath. The Predator swiped at him with her claws and he was thrown to the ground. Damien had no more strength to fight. The blood lust in the Predator's eyes chilled Damien's blood. He was so close... The Predator lunged, her claws glinting in the sun. Damien had no more strength to fight, but he still had the will to run. He had one more tactic... one more chance. A crazy Ivan. He grabbed some sand and threw it at the Predator's face. He rolled forward and the Predator flew past him. He dashed to the cave while the Predator was stunned by the sand attack. Damien barely made it to the cave's entrance. He only just fit into the small mouth of the cave. The Predator leaped for the kill, but got stuck between the cave. A small smile appeared on Damien's face as his hands found the spear. Today was his lucky day. He thrust the spear through the mouth of the Predator. She writhed, but only for a few seconds. Damien withdrew the spear and tasted the blood. She tasted delicious.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Sliding his nail under the gap between tightly glued papers, he pulled up in irritation, and tore his nail instead. The day at the office had been grueling, Mrs. Jinble sent in three new spells, none of which worked as intended, but had to be tested nonetheless. That was the law at the National Spell Book Association of Halbrook. So, he sat with three fingers that were green, a throbbing and swollen nose, and round bold spot on his right cheek, where earlier that afternoon a rather full beard had been. He'd moan about it less if he were not sick. The swollen nose made his nostrils bigger, and snot poured out like water down a tap. He had two tissues stuffed into each nostril, and was rather scared to see what came out once he removed them. \" Oh, bloody broomsticks! Can this day get any worse? \" he said aloud without intending to do so, and cursed under his breath as he heard Catriona stir next to him. \" Probably. \" Catriona leaned over her table, her glasses sliding down the rim of her nose. \" Look what that nutter, Pambly, sent. \" She turned her chair and pulled out her foot from under the table.

Smeezly heard the thump of her step as she made her way down the long corridor, and even as she took the steps up to the potion master's office. He took a knife, and began to cut from the side. Still the paper remained untouched. Sweat droplets gathered on his forehead and he wiped them angrily away with the back of his hand. By the time he had the National Spell book open on the fire chapter, Catriona's thumping footsteps approached him again. The foot was half the size, and a trail of hair followed her in a line. \" Kilma wants you in her office. She said you must bring the letter Balthu, or something, sent you. \" She plopped down on her chair, and leaned her head back, dizzy and fatigued from the effects of the reversal potion. \" Did she say why? \" She shook her head, and brought her fingers up to rub her eyes. \" I didn't stay long enough to ask. \" He gathered the envelope under his arm and made his way down the same corridor. \" While you're there, tell her I quit. \" Smeezly stopped in his tracks and turned to her, wide eyed. She laughed, grimly. \" Oh, that's right. We didn't specialize and no other organization will take us. \" \" You'll feel better soon, Cat, \" he said, and continued down the corridor. Truth be told, he wasn't sure which of them hated their work more. Catriona spawned a swarm of bees last week, which were only interested in her, and he had a whirling axe chance him around in the office for a good minute before she came to his aid. They'd both jump at the opportunity to leave. Everyone from management filled Kilma's office, and watched him approached through the glass. He felt uneasy, and went through the list of mistakes he made during the day, finding them to be more than he could count on his fingers and toes. \" Mr. Groof, please come in, \" Kilma said. *Never good when she uses the last name*, he thought to himself grimly. *Where on earth will I find another job that pays as much? * \" Do you have it? \" a woman asked.

The King was murdered by his son, who in turn who done in by his. And then war struck and a foot soldier pocketed me. Now, he was the one who had me for the longest before you came along. He was cunning and fearsome, but knew when to back down from a battle. As a general his chose his battles instead of letting the lust of power get to him. His daughter was called Karla and she stole me for the youth I gave to her father. She ran off with the love of her life, who could only be called so because he took me and she took her life. The first person who used my powers to their potential was the mage who was also a pickpocket. How petty my misadventures had become, I thought then. I was in love with being so terribly wanted, in love with the power to deny them what they wanted of me. But the Grand Mage Asterri knew I was n't complete. I was n't of fire or life alone. I was the first soul to be made by man and not the Shadows, who lurk beyond the Precipice to watch my masters who could not die. Asterri saw my child-like soul, and gave me knowledge. He helped me grow, and want. And then he gave me up, tucked me away in an ornate bejeweled chest far away in a cave. Monsters of fire came to wander in the cave, in search for me. And that, was how we met, adventurer Reen. You slayed the monsters, plucked me from the chest and put me into this cursed bag, probably from a coven of witches. It kept my presence hidden. And you have been content to let me sit idly. Why do you read, adventurer? Why wo n't you bring me on your expeditions and let me keep you alive? Why do you live life like no miracle has come upon you? What is your secret? How do you keep your smile as you age? Why do n't you embrace the fire, ice and vitality I can bestow upon you, so that you can smile for more decades to come? Oh, you're going to fall asleep as I speak? Answer me! Hey! Wake up!

{"input": "- You are a 13-year-old babysitter and every month, on the full moon, a set of parents asks you to watch their child for the night. You begin to suspect this is not a coincidence.", "output": "\" This Friday... the 18th... of course I can babysit Jake again.. Uh huh, same rate... No problem, see you on Friday.\" Barely seconds after ending the call, I was already checking the internet to confirm a growing suspicion of mine... yup, this was the fifth time in a row the Jacobis had me babysit their son Jake on a night that coincided with a full moon. The first time, I only noticed when glanced out the window. The second time, I chocked it up to a coincidence. The third time too, but damn, five times in a row definitely ca n't be a coincidence. Well, Friday is when I finally figure out what's going on and it definitely ca n't come soon enough and later that night I called Derek to confirm our plans. He was skeptical at first, but there was no way my geeky boyfriend could resist the chance to see a werewolf. We could barely contain ourselves during classes that week and I practically raced out of my house early Friday evening to get to the Jacobi residence a few streets over. \" Hi Sam, how are you?\" Mr. Jacobi greeted me, a warm smile on his face, much like every night. They always seemed a bit too nice to me, but I'd figured they were just happy to get some time away. No, however, I know their secret. But there's still something I ca n't under - \" You okay honey?\" Mrs. Jacobi's pretty voice snapped me out of my reverie. \" Yes, Mrs. Jacobi, I'm fine,\" I lied. \" Just thinking about the test I had earlier today.\" \" You probably did fine,\" she said, a warm smile on her face, much like Mr. Jacobi. \" Well, Jake's up in his room, taking a bit of a nap. He might be a bit wired tonight, but do n't worry too much about his bed time, since it's a Friday. See you in a few hours.\" \" Thank you, enjoy your night,\" I said, practically hurrying them out of the house so I could call Derek and have him come over. Unfortunately, despite all of our expectations, nothing extraordinary happened during the night. Derek and I watched TV and played some games with Jake, who seemed to be a bit quieter than usual. Derek left a bit early in the night, since he was feeling pretty tired, and the Jacobis came back around midnight and dropped me off at home, like they usually did. Or, at least, that's how I remember it. The truth was only revealed to me 3 days later when I finally convinced Derek to show me what he had taped. I knew there must have been something on it, since he avoided me like the plague that weekend, but I remembered nothing weird happening. But nothing - absolutely nothing - could have prepared me for what he'd recorded. The camera feed showed Derek, Jake, and I playing a fun game of Sorry when the at precisely eleven, I seemed to freeze. I sat there, motionless, for 10 minutes straight, even as Derek kept messing with me. Then, in mere seconds, I... I changed.......... I was so right, but so, so damn wrong; Jake was n't a werewolf... I was.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

[ WP ]", "output": "Everyone had told me that donating my body to science would be a ridiculous endeavor. \" Why would you do something like that?\" my mother asked me, folding her arms across her chest. She stared at me inquisitively. \" Because I want to be able to give my life some sort of meaning, even if I have to wait for death.\" Well, I did n't need to wait for death. A letter had arrived in the mail a few days later. A scientist was looking for volunteers for an experiment to have their consciousness transferred to an artificial brain. What luck! I could do something meaningful with my life! This experiment, if successful, could pave the way for who knows how many medical break throughs and save countless lives! Oh how wrong I was. After hours of being poked and prodded by the scientist and his team, they placed an mask over my face. I inhaled deeply as the scientist explained. \" You're going to go to sleep, like any normal surgical procedure. When you awake, a long length of time may have passed, as we'll need to keep you in a coma while we monitor your brain waves to make sure everything is working correctly. If this works, you will essentially be immortal. And as we promised, your body will be donated to science for medical research. We thank you for your sacrifice.\" I felt so important, so regal. I almost felt like I was single handedly saving the world. Imagine! People who were in vegetative states for decades could have their consciousness transferred to an artificial brain and live again! They could communicate with loved ones again! I awoke what I assumed was days later. Everything felt strange, almost weightless. I had the ability to see but had no eyes. I could think but could not articulate what I was thinking. I tried to speak, but having no body, nothing could be said. The room I was in was dark and dismal. I could see beakers and test tubes laying about. A single light flickered overhead. Papers were scattered across the floor, as if someone had been quickly searching for something. Days turned into weeks. I was beginning to wonder if I had been forgotten. I heard what sounded like heavy, muffled foot steps coming towards the room. If I had a heart, it surely would be leaping for joy! I watched as a tall, scruffy man entered the room. He wore all black and carried a small flashlight. I knew he was not a scientist. He was something much more sinister. He approached me quietly, making sure not to make any loud and sudden noises. That's when it hit me, this man was a burglar. \" Hey Johnny! Come check this out! There's a brain or something in here!\" Another man entered the room. He took one look at me and grimaced. \" That's disgusting! I do n't want to see that!\" He picked me up and walked me over to the desk. He opened a drawer and threw me inside, slamming it shut. I could hear their muffled voices. \" Let's get out of here. There's nothing in this abandoned lab worth stealing. Besides, I'm sure someone is gon na find that rotting body in the basement and I do n't want to be the prime suspect.\" Rotting body in the basement? The only thing I could think of was mine. As far as I knew, I was the only one who agreed to undergo the experiment. This meant that not only was I trapped in this drawer with no means of escape, but my body was rapidly decaying in the basement instead of being used for science.

It was becoming an epidemic. More and more people continued to gurgling that steamy black liquid in their glass containers, some simply have pods that stood by while boiling water rushed through for a single cup of that addictive substance. I tried to stay clean, tried alternative drinks, like tea and those 5-Hour Energy drinks, none of them worked, nothing could provide the taste, or pleasure, of the ink colored water that everyone injected into their bodies more than twice a day, sometimes even five times a day, if you catch a young teenager at a Starbucks or an overworked white collar worker working a double. It all happens suddenly as well, one day no one carried a paper cup with a white top, or a metallic thermos, but the next, everyone had some version of holder that they refused to leave home with. Stores, carts, and shops popped up like unpredicted blemishes, one after another providing different versions of the same thing; java, mocha java, mocha java with a twist, cream, sugar, two creams and sugar, whip scream on top, chocolate syrup, so and so forth. Two years had past and now it's in everyone's homes, their own personalized drug dispenser, giving them instant satisfaction they all believe they need. I never truly figured out how it all started, or how it will turn out in the future, but one thing is for certain; it'll never leave. But, I'm hopeful that maybe, one day far, far, in the future, it'll be replaced by something less consuming, and more safe. Maybe, they'll legalize the use of cocaine, or heroin, who knows really.

Still, the front page had touted a story on the 2014 World Cup that was sure to hold his attention far better than a two-month old issue of SkyMall ever could. He was ushered through the rest of the security checkpoint surprisingly quickly given the usual delays at Logan International. He walked toward the end of the conveyor belt to claim his things, watching the stainless steel rollers spin as he passed his hand over them. \" Wrong contain...\" he started to mutter as he looked down at the paper, which now showed a picture of a baseball diamond and boasted the headline: \" Yankees trump Sox 7-3.\" He glanced down again and noticed his jacket - this was definitely his container. He picked the paper up and examined it more closely, noticing the date: September 10th, 2001. The next container slid down the rollers and slammed into the side of his container. A man quickly followed behind, claiming the box as his and gathering his belongings - an out-of-date Nokia phone and a CD player. Ryan looked around, confused. He rushed to the nearest coffee stand to get something to perk him up. He handed the barista a $ 10 bill on the $ 2.50 tab. As she counted the change he noticed Abraham Lincoln's face on the old five dollar bill. \" Excuse me,\" Ryan asked, \" what's the date?\" \" September 10th,\" replied the barista. \" And the year?\" \" 2001...\" she said hesitantly, obviously surprised by the question. Ryan grabbed the coffee and hurried away. He ducked into the restroom and splashed water on his face. He pulled on his hair as he wracked his brain, trying to wrap his mind around what he was experiencing. \" September 10th, 2001,\" he thought, realizing what the next day would bring. He had to warn someone. He rushed out of the bathroom and headed back toward the security checkpoint.... Ryan awoke to a creak as Agent Mallory walked back through the door. He had no idea how long he had been in the interrogation room. Hours, surely. \" Did you stop it?,\" Ryan asked. Mallory glared at him. \" Let's start over. I want to try this one more time,\" the agent said, clearly exasperated. \" How did you know?\" \" I've told you everything. The truth,\" Ryan pleaded. He watched as the agent pinched the bridge of his nose. \" I'm done with this asshole,\" Mallory yelled to the unknown figures behind the one-way mirror. Ryan was shuffled back to his holding cell.

Trails of flame led toward our planet, objects of heavenly origin plummeting through the atmosphere. And soon enough, all that was left in the sky was the moon, a lonely face mirroring our own. I watched from the tallest tower, my surroundings illuminated in ethereal fire, a midnight twilight. They flailed and lashed out with glorious radiant wings, desperate to break their fall. None of them could. Except for one. Slowly, it descended. The most beautiful angel of all. Wings of steel, eyes of gold, metallic tendrils flowing from its body. My eyes met the angel's, and in that moment I knew. I turned from my vantage point and hurdled down the tower's stairs, racing to meet this holy being, the One written about in the histories and prophecies. I burst through the doors, and my bare feet echoed in resounding thuds over the metal ground as I sprinted to meet the angel. It was already on the ground, kneeling. It was hunched, as if in pain, and its wings and tendrils were rapidly rusting. Unsure what else to do, I knelt next to it, and held the angel in my arms. The angel looked at me. The gold sheen had left its eyes, replaced with cold and empty white. \" We flew too close to the sun...\" it said, in a voice like grinding gears. \" You are the angels now.\" It took its hand, and placed it to my forehead. Wings of a dove sprouted from my back, so similar to the angels', yet so different. I am filled with knowledge, emotion, responsibility, harmony, omnipresence. The angel closed its eyes, and fell to the ground. Its wings dissolved, its tendrils disintegrated. It was now nothing more than a man, empty and lifeless. I looked up to the sky, bleak and dark. It was so empty without stars. I spread my wings, and soar. I was there the day the angels fell. And I was there the day the angels rose.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I call order!\" Nebbum, god of sleep, banged his gavel on his podium. \" We must come to order this instant!\" Wudall, god of toast, rolled his eyes and turned to the shouting god next to him. \" Please, Nebbum, you're hardly helping.\" He spoke over the roar of gods all shouting over everybody else. The grand room they were in was built from marble, and the sound was deafening as it reverberated and bounced off of the walls. Nebbum lashed out a sharp retort that was lost in the roar and continued to bang his gavel. Wudall sighed and took his own gavel and began to bang it with Nebbum. Eventually other gods began to catch on and bang their gavels, and after several minutes of banging, the room eventually fell silent once more. A slender, pale-faced god stepped around his podium and stepped into the middle of the large room. He cleared his throat and adjusted his necktie. \" Excuse me, gods and goddesses, but we do have an emergency brewing right underneath our very noses.\" He turned and nodded at his secretary, who in turn reached over and turned some dials that were next to her. A large image appeared over the crowd. \" This,\" the slender god gestured, \" is John.\" He looked around the room and made eye contact with Iwdione, the goddess of death, who nodded. He took his time to survey the room, to make sure that everybody was watching and listening. \" He is scheduled to die in twelve minutes. Cardiac arrest.\" A loud bang sounded from somewhere in the crowd, and a fat god with long, flowing black hair stood up. \" I do protest, of course! John is supposed to be eating breakfast with Sally today!\" He turned and motioned for Wudall to stand up. \" Wudall, you of all people should be against this! Just last night he was thinking of making toast for her, was n't he?\" Wudall stood and nodded, clearly uncomfortable. \" Yes, Owjun.\" He sat quickly back down. Nebbum stood up. \" I have to protest this too, I'm afraid.\" The slender god in the middle of the room groaned. If Nebbum were against it, it would be much harder to wrap this up. Nebbum ran a hand over his bald head and then pointed at the miserable and pale-faced god in the middle of the room. \" Mebris, this man is under my power right now. He is sleeping, and you did *not*\" he picked up his gavel and slammed it down on the podium \" discuss this with me.\" He crossed his arms and looked around the room. \" Are we to let Mebris, the god of misery dictate today's schedule?\" He huffed. \" He should be the *last* god that we'd let in charge of our itinerary.\" A rumble of agreement swept the large room. Iwdione, the goddess of death, stood and banged her gavel. \" Excuse me, gods and goddesses. This man is going to die in ten minutes.\" She put the gavel down and pointed at the sleeping human in the image. \" Nothing will stop his death. I have made the arrangement with Amton already.\" Amton was the god of appointments. Iwdione turned to Nebbum and bowed. \" Lord Nebbum, I am sorry that I did not consult you first. I did not realize that the time of his death would be under your shift. Will you please allow me to complete my task?\" Nebbum puffed his chest up and returned the bow. \" You may, Lord Iwdione.\" A god cleared his throat and stood up. Everybody groaned. He held his hands up and shook his head, smiling. \" Now, now, guys, I just wanted to say that I'm quite proud of how you all seemed to work this out, it's quite mature of all of you.\" He pointed at Mebris, who was still looking miserable as he stood at the middle of the room. \" Mebris... Where is this man going after he dies?\" Mebris shifted uncomfortably. He had made a deal with Mycldir, god of paradise, that the man would join him there. It had been a discreet deal, of course. \" Well...\" The god who was addressing him smiled and opened his arms. \" He is more than welcome to come with me.\" \" He is taken.\" The room turned to see Mycldir stand up. He stood tall and proud, his gold robes as bright as ever. \" I am sorry, Esdros, but he is coming with me.\" Esdros frowned. \" But I was the first to address this, was I not? Why do you take it?\" \" If I take John, you can have Mr. Adams from New York.\" Esdros smiled. \" That will do just fine.\" He turned to the rest and bowed. \" I am sorry to have interrupted. That will be all.\" Mebris clapped his hands. \" Five minutes until his death! Is everybody content?\" Tyseyr, god of dirt, banged his gavel and stood. He scoffed loudly and motioned at the sleeping human. \" Will this man be buried? Because surely nobody approached me about this.\" He banged his gavel down again for good measure. \" He must be cremated! Nobody talked to me about burying him!\" \" Lord Tyseyr,\" Mebris pleaded, \" we will get together about his funeral arrangements in a few days, his family will need that much time to arrange it all themselves. Please, sit down.\" He turned to the rest of the gods. \" Anybody else have any problems that relate to the next *four* minutes?\" Bang. \" I do.\" Mebris sighed. \" What is it, Lord Tawmir?\" Tawmir, god of dogs, shook his head. \" I am sorry but I simply can not allow John to die this very instant.\" The room sighed and a low rumble of discontent rolled off the walls. Mebris shook his head. \" I am sorry but you do not have jurisdiction here.\" \" I do, actually...\" Tawmir pulled a paper out of his robes. \" This is a certificate of ownership.\" He gave it to his secretary who put it into a slot and twisted some dials. The image of the paper appeared next to the sleeping man. \" John has officially been declared purchased by Andres, a newborn Labrador.\" Mebris stood, mouth agape. \" When?\" \" Just last night.\" Tawmir procured a video tape and handed it to his secretary. \" On this tape you will see Sally going to the animal shelter. She purchased Andres only last night. You can not kill John, since Andres is currently his owner, and I am in charge of the dog sector.\" He smiled apologetically. \" I understand your predicament, but I really can not allow you to kill John right this moment, he is needed by Andres.\" Mebris sagged his shoulders in defeat and motioned for his secretary to remove the image of John sleeping. \" Very well.\" He bowed. \" My lords, I withdraw my case.\" He slithered back to his podium and another god stepped forward, ready to present his case about a lawn that was about to be cut.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The trees whispered in the wind, their rustling voices ominous. No birds sang, and the path that wound between the trunks dissipated into the darkness of the woods. Yet our hero was not to be deterred, for in the rotten heart of the ancient forest was the cure to the spell that entrapped her father, the king. After fighting through bandits, griffins, and half of Evil Step Mother's army, the warrior princess had finally found the Sword of Light needed to make her way through the Enchanted Forest.

[ You ca n't do that. ] The princess blew a raspberry. \" Look, I took out a group of fifteen bandits, aggravated a group of innocent griffins, and then went toe-to-toe with an entire *army*. I'm *exhausted*.\" [ You ca n't. I just said you would n't. You are too great to be overtaken by exhaustion; you are the hero! Besides, it was only half an army. ] \" O-only *half an army*?! You go fight half an army! Tell me how it feels!\" Grumbling under her breath, she rolled over and buried her face in her arms. Her muffled voice said \" besides, I knew those people. They use to be my soldiers. Some were my friends. I did n't want to fight them at all.\" [ These things happen. ] \" Shut up.\" [ No. You have to save your father. The whole kingdom is depending on you. ] \" You only care about your stupid story. Leave me alone. I need sleep!\" [ Princess, get up. ] [ Princess. ] [ PRINCESS. ] \" Leave me alone!\" she bellowed. Her arms came away, revealing the fury on her beautiful face. \" Go find some other stupid hero! I'm *sick* of it all! Those'bandits'? I'm pretty sure they were just a group of homeless people. The griffins were n't even on the way. I'm pretty sure you made me climb their mountain just for an extra chapter in your epic.\" [ What?

I gave you an absolutely fabulous introduction -- ] \" You called me the'flower of maidenhood.'What kind of crap is that?\" [ You ca n't say'crap'! ] The princess jumped to her feet, staggered once, then shouted \" CRAP. It's all crap! You *suck* at narration. These names are all ridiculous, and plot holes are *everywhere. * I nearly fell through one yesterday. I ca n't even see where I'm going because your descriptions are terrible, and every person I met was boring because you could n't make a three-dimensional character to save your life!\" [ Why, you little -- ] \" You're third rate.

All I want is to see her face again, even if it means living my life over again.\" As he punched some stuff into the little phone-like gadget on the side of the helmet, I smiled. I would start my life again, from the age of 15 where I would see her face for the first time. I would spend every memory with her again, the good, and the bad. This was a dream come true. I would hold her in my arms once more. \" Just remember, the simulation wo n't end till it catches up to today, even if you die there.

I would cherish every last second with her.\" He nodded, and slid the helmet onto my head. It felt a little weird at first, until he put the needle in my arm. There was a small rush of adrenaline before everything went white. I rubbed my eyes and looked around. The mall was packed, people rushing to get their christmas shopping complete. I looked down at my daggy jeans and Nirvana t-shirt. I put my hands to my face. No wrinkles. It worked. I looked around. If I remembered correctly, she would be the counter girl at the music store. I bolted through the mall as fast as I could till I found the store in question. I took a deep sigh. This was the moment that changed everything for me. I quickly took off my wristband and pocketed it. She always hated that thing. I walked through the doors and looked towards the store counter. She was n't there. Do n't panic, I told myself. She's probably on break or something. I casually stroll up to the counter. \" Excuse me, is Jean here?\" \" Who?\" The clerk looked at me puzzlingly. \" Jean? Jean Chambers?\" \" Sorry dude, nobody here by that name.\" I started to panic a little. Something was wrong. This was the right time, so why was n't she here? I noticed someone familiar in the rock section, and headed over. \" Katie!\" She turned to me. \" Do I know you?\" \" Not yet. I'm Jeans friend.\" \" Who?\" She also looked puzzled. \" Jean? Jean Chambers? Your best friend?\" \" I do n't know who you are, but I've never heard of anyone by that name before. You must be mistaking me for someone else.\" She then left the store in quite a quick pace. My fears were getting worse. She was n't where we first met, her best friend did n't know who she was, I felt a pit in my stomach. There was only one thing left to do. I knocked on the door of the house. I had n't been here in a long time. I do n't even remember the rosebushes by the window. The door opens. A young Mr. Chambers stood there looking down at me. \" What?\" He said grumpily. He was never a man of words. \" Hi, is Jean here?\" \" Who?\" The pit in my stomach got bigger. It was really happening. \" Jean. Your daughter?\" \" I do n't know what you're playing at kid.

I lay broken on the street, blood forming in a pool beneath me, my fingers clawing at the air in a vain attempt to cling to life. The bullet, now resting somewhere in my abdomen, had basically turned my insides to jelly. There was no hope that I was going to pull through. As I stared up at the sky, I stopped fighting. A cloud wandered lazily into my vision from somewhere off to the right, coming into focus as it came out from behind the top of a tall building. It looked like a rabbit. I blinked and a drop of blood obscured my vision, reminding me that I was n't long for this world. Then I was standing beside myself. I looked down at my body and knew that I was dead. My eyes held a glazed over quality which you only find on those who have passed on; as if they're no longer able to focus on our world and are instead peering into something deeper. A man in a black trench coat was beside me. I looked into his eyes, which were no color in particular. \" Well, we'd best get you along, son.\" He said to me, placing a hand on my shoulder. \" Wait, before I go, can I ask you one thing?\" I replied, looking down at myself. \" Sure, if you make it quick. Just know that I do n't always have the answer you're looking for.\" He said, taking his hand off of my shoulder and placing it in the pocket of his coat. \" Did it work? Did I do it?\" I asked simply. The man in the trench coat looked away from me and took a long time to reply. Then he heaved a sigh and met my gaze. \" It's not really my place to tell you this, but yeah. You got him. I sent him along just before I came to you.\" He said. Then he put his hand on my shoulder again, and I was n't there anymore. I soared through a black ocean for a time. My mind reeled at the size of it - infinitely large and yet it held only me. A space beyond space. I'd done it. That was all that mattered. He could n't hurt that girl anymore - I'd ended him. I was a murderer, but I was also murdered. Was there an afterlife? If so, was there an afterlife for a person like me? What would I find there? At the end of the black ocean, I saw a small point of light. I swam over to it and it grew bigger. As it came into focus, I saw a room. A hospital room. I was hovering somewhere in front of the back wall, just below the ceiling. On the bed below me, I could see a woman straining, an intense look on her face. She was giving birth. \" Congratulations, folks. It's a girl!\" The doctor said, handing the baby over to the woman lying in the bed. The mother gazed at her daughter with endless love, her pain from moments before forgotten as she was caught up in the wonder of the moment. The little girl, as beautiful in those first moments as she would be later in life, was like a magnet to me. I could feel myself attaching to her consciousness, hearing the unintelligible thoughts of a child just born. Somewhere in there, though, I could feel another presence slipping away. A man, incredibly old, inhabiting the same plane as myself for a fraction of an instant. Our eyes met somewhere, and just for the briefest of instances, I glimpsed the mechanism of the universe; the machine that retrieved consciousness from those individuals who had n't finished their time here yet and placed it in a new vessel. And then it was gone, and so was I. I was inside the baby girl just as her former self left, and my last conscious thought was that I'd be with her forever.

{"input": "All Volkswagen beetles turned into car sized carnivorous beetles.", "output": "\" The roads are dangerous! \" Sarah cried over the phone. Nobody was listening, they all knew the risks of the mission they were undertaking. Jim comforted his wife with soothing and hollow words before hanging up. With little fanfare, the squad of impromptu militiamen loaded up their weapons, mostly hunting shotguns and a rifle from Jim's gun locker, and piled into his pickup. The world had gone to hell in the last three hours. At first it was hard to believe the reports on the tv, cars turning into giant monsters? Giant monsters who ate people? Jim and his friends happened to be in the cabin, resting after hunting all morning and wanting to avoid the noon sun's heat. None of them were prepared for this, although they had bugout bags sitting at their homes, uselessly. The plan was to muster at Jim's cabin in case of disaster anyway, so they remained there, hoping to do some good. They did n't have to wait long before getting a call from Jim's brother, a police officer downtown. He sounded panicked. \" The situations not- its not good. Damn bugs are everywhere, I had no idea so many people owned them. The national guard is on its way, but they're going for the county seat first, so who the hell knows when they'll get up to us. \" A pause in the call, Jim could hear the distant pops of gunshots in the distance. \" We could use you Jim, you and your hunting buddies. Come down to the station with all the guns and ammunition you've got. \" Jim's brother did n't need to say anymore, Jim was always one to help, in any way he could. And so he found himself steering cautiously down the county road towards the center of town. It was silent save for the sound of his Chevy's engine, and the rolling of tires on the pavement. The police station came into sight, half a mile up the road. The gunshots Jim had heard over the phone had stopped. He hoped they were still alive, but he had no idea what these bugs were capable of. A strange scratching sound to his right pulled him back to reality. It was coming from his right, an approaching intersection with a side street. The scratching grew louder, *It must be a bug*, Jim thought. He slowed the truck and motioned to his friends behind him, but they already had their weapons trained on the source of the sound. It burst in front of them, must have been doing 50 in a 35, barreling right through a stop sign and turning to face them. It was terrible to look at. One giant horn protruded from its face, ending in a sharp point that Jim did not want to get a closer look at. It opened its mouth and hissed at them, revealing a jaw full of squared teeth. It reminded him of scrap metal crushers. It reared back on its six legs, then began to charge at them, going from 0 to 60 in approximately 6.2 seconds. 6.2 seconds was just enough time to get his own truck moving again, dodging the bug by inches. The maneuver tossed one of his buddies off the truck. The bug turned, what looked like a twenty foot turning radius, and immediately moved towards Jim's fallen friend. He barely had time to lift his shotgun, firing it once before the bug was on him. The first bite split him at the waist, a clean cut. He did n't even have time to scream Jim winced, but continued driving. There was nothing he could have done. The distraction his friend had provided allowed him to make it to the station. Unfortunately, the bug quickly picked up the chase, flying towards him at a top speed of what had to have been 115 mph. Jim jumped out of the pickup and dashed to the doors. He flung them open and immediately went for the ladder to the roof. Screams came from behind him; the bug must have gotten another one of his friends. Grim determination gripped Jim as he climbed up the final rung and onto the roof. His brother was there, lying prone, a blank look on his face. Jim called his brother's name. He snapped out of whatever state he was in and smiled, briefly, at the sight of his brother. \" They're all dead, Jim. Its just me. And you. \" He said, as his smile faded. Jim did not react to his brother's words. Instead, he peered over the edge of the roof to see that all his friends were dead; the bug had taken a massive chunk out of his pickup before any of them had the chance to get out. The bug lifted its head at Jim's shape moving on the roof. *Shit*, Jim thought. At least they were safe up on the roof. No sooner had that thought crossed Jim's mind than the bug's shell cracked in two, revealing two massive, translucent wings. They both thudded against the air, propelling it up and over Jim and his brother. Jim tracked it as it flew, landing with a massive crash on the other side of the roof. This was it. Jim's brother had taken his feet, standing by his side, ready to accept their fate. Jim looked at the beetle, then at his brother. Pulling back his fist, he punched his brother in the arm with all his strength. His brother grabbed his soon-to-be-bruised arm and whirled to face Jim, a look of confusion and agitation on his face. \" What the fuck Jim?! \" He said. Jim only smiled, as the bug approached. As it opened its jaws, he said to his brother \" Punch buggy. No punch back... \" This was my fist reply to a prompt here, please let me know how you felt about it!", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

OK, but I've been thinking, that apple you gave me wasn't as nice as the ones Eve gets. \" * *The apple that God had given Adam had been from the same tree. He had made a flock of doves pick the apples off the tree, and fly them to the cave.

He decided to finally introduce himself to her, but in a different form. * -- -- -- The apples, in Eve's opinion, were there to keep Adam making fires for her. She would have left long ago if it wasn't for that. It was quite an effort every day to get him his apples, but she enjoyed the break from the cave.

He had made snakes to be scary. \" Come here little fella! \" Eve reached out to the snake. \" Do not pick apples from this tree sssssinner!! \" Eve had never had a fright in her life, but when the snake started talking, she nearly wet her leaf. She was about to turn and run, but then the snake piped up again. \" You are forbidden to pick from this tree!! \" The snake bellowed. God was happy with the fearful presence he had managed to create. *I am all powerful! * Eve's brows furrowed, and she tilted her head. \" Excuse me? \" She said, and instead of running, took a step towards the snake.

Take the apple. Actually - I implore you – take all the apples. Because you'll need them. \" Eve paused. She was good at sensing attitudes, and this snake had one. \" Why? \" \" Oh no reason. It's just that they're probably the best apples you'll be able to find. I mean, let's be honest, you got lucky with this tree, and Adam is the real bread winner.

I stared out the entrance of the alleyway watching the snow temporarily purify the filthiness of the city with a blanket of white. Knowing that by this time tomorrow, the gleaming snow would be a filthy grey slush, made my heart heavy to the point I could n't bear it. With tears in my eyes at the thought, I pull the syringe and surgical tube out of my grungy coat. My hands shake as I hold my lighter under the filthy spoon. Partly from the frigid air, but mostly from the urge; that overwhelming need to pretend that I'm alright, as the sounds of horns honking and cats fighting in the night plays as the soundtrack of my life. As I put the lighter down and pick up the syringe, flashes of memories play back to more innocent times, when nights like this meant days of fun to follow. Tears spill over my cheeks, scalding hot on my icy skin as I dip the needle in the murky brown liquid and pull the plunger. I solemnly stare at the syringe, the poison inside is the only thing I have left to live for, the battery that controls what life I have left. I place the syringe on my lap and roll up the sleeve of my coat. I wrap the tube around my arm and cinch it tightly; the pressure building from stopped blood flow making my arm tingle. I manage to find a small vein in the crook of my elbow; all the others are shrunken or dying from shooting up so much so fast. I stick the needle in and push the plunger, eyes closed as the rush hits me and, for a little while, washes away all the pain and memories inside. My hands fall to the gritty pavement beneath me and my eyes focus on the pale light of the streetlamp high above. My vision fades and the dim light grows darker as a comforting warmth fills my chest. In the darkness of my mind, I hear a gentle, loving voice say \" Take my hand, it is time for you to go back home.\" I slowly raise my hand and rise up from the cold, unforgiving ground. \" Take my hand and I will lead you home,\" the voice says again. I turn back one last time to see my broken body leaning against the brick wall of the alley, a peaceful smile on my world weary face.

It turns out your life has only been so hard because you've missed every single hidden power-up so far.", "output": "*Formatting might be weird, doing this on mobile, I might fix this eventually* ===================== SCHERAZADE: Pacifist Walkthrough ====================== Contents: 1. Introduction 2. Tips & Caveats 3. On Party Management 4. Childhood ( tutorial ) 5. Teenrager 6. Adulthood ( Pacifist ) 7. Saving The World ( Pacifist ) ====================== 1. Introduction Scherazade was one of my favourite life simulations back in the 2090s, but it strikes me that not many people know about it, and those that do online seem to prefer the Warlord path that leads to him being kind of lonely in adulthood until his Depression reaches rank 20 usually, locking you into Bezerker Rage. What a lot of people seem to forget is that while it is easy to get into pretty epic battles in this sim, the core gameplay is in exploring the life of this storytelling weirdo. So, I've made a loose walkthrough. Please be aware that there's enough random generation in the game that you could easily fail to follow this faq, even if you do everything perfectly. I had to reload my save a few times during Childhood, because of the Childhood Enemy encounter got a bit hairy. ========================= 2. Tips & Caveats Scherazade is not gay. Exploring that option, while he'll be openly up for it intellectually, increases his Self Doubt over time. He can live perfectly happily to outward appearences, but there's always that niggling worry in his head. So pairing him with Fellow Nerd characters of the same sex is n't optimal if you want him entering adulthood with full mental stats. There was some contraversy when the game came out, because of that, but it is a interesting stylistic choice: the man is n't that into dudes, but is n't blind enough to deny the option should it come up. Also, Scherazade is not athletic naturally, but it is possible to get him into literally any sport in the game if you poke and prompt him to learn at a young age enough to manipulate his Mindscape. Also, on that note, yes the dream sequences are weird. Scherazade has a lot of fears, many of which are irrational, like Sorcerer Mickey Mouse being a real shapeless malevolent being from another world waging war upon humans through dreams. You can avoid those missions by not watching Nightmare on Elm Street until you're an adult, but they're actually pretty fun side missions and good for the xp.

None the less, he had hazy visions of an endless plain of brown grass beneath a dark sky, of campfires and armies. It was the campfires that captivated him. They were cookfires, fires for meat. His new people were vegetarians. And they were so, he reasoned, because the game on this planet was terrible. Touch, chewy, with a bitter, metallic taste. No amount of washing or cooking could get the bitterness out. He had tried. He had made them try. They had prepared dozens of beasts each prepared a dozen different ways. Roasted, salted, smoked, it did n't matter. The bitterness was so profound he spat them all back out. They were not human, these new people. Yet they were still people, he had found out, all the same. They were moved by ambition. They had unlocked the secrets of DNA and cloning. What they had meant to do with it, he did not know. Sell the secrets or clones to the highest bidder? Get rich? Probably. It did not matter now. The secrets were now gone. And the people, the people were his. He felt a bit depressed about that. It was the hunt he craved. And this hunt had been too quick. He was bigger, stronger then this race. He took over their lab, their scientists. He harnessed their ambition. He made them serve him, but promised them greater glory. They spread out from there. Soon he was leading a great horde. It felt natural. It felt like him. He rode ahead of his army on a great blue destrier, its horns polished to a terrifying gleam. On it, he trampled his enemies, smashed them, tossed them far into the air. The cities fell to him. The Great Khan he named himself, not entirely sure why. He was moved by hunger. They thought his hunger ambition, at first. They understood that. But the dead memory, the memory that was his but was n't his, of the campfires and their smoking meat, it haunted him. Haunted his nights and days. At last he tried a new meat, the only one yet he had n't had. They resisted at first, horrified. But he was their Khan, and his order, law. A prisoner was selected, a powerful merchant who had resisted his rise. And the Great Khan had him roasted over an open fire beneath the aubergine sky, amid the golden-brown brush. And that night, for the first time in memory, the first time since his rebirth, the Great Khan ate well, and was satisfied. It is a terrible thing, he knew, to eat ones own. But they were not his own, just his subjects. And they owed him tribute.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The view was unremarkable, or remarkable, depending on your temperament and if you could call it a view. A dimensionless void of light, well I suppose it was light, scattered all throughout and extending forever in every direction. I worked up the urge to call out but no voice came out and in fact, in the ordinary sense, no words came to me in that place. My thoughts felt rather uncontained, impressions building up and breaking away, eternity experienced instant by instant. I decided that whatever *this* was, \" I\" was *it*, too; and it occurred to me simultaneously that I could perhaps control whatever it was, this experience. I decided to play. Images stacked upon images as in a reel came to me. I observed my previous lives, every action and reaction, every word I had ever uttered. All of them leading up to whatever now was. The persons who I had been, how many were there? I attempted to count -- myriads upon myriads, beings I've never yet witnessed, or I guess I had never witnessed, animals I had no recollection of being, down even to the most insignificant of cells. An eternity of birth and death, in guises big and small. I could n't be all that, could I? What was I, anyway? This thought, naturally unsettling, felt as though it were leading up to an answer that I was n't quite ready for. I could n't swallow it, even if I had a mouth with which to swallow. I decided that if my last life had taken place on the planet earth, I should naturally check up on the place. So it was, in an unseen instant, flashed before me the lives of every human being ever conceived and delivered on earth. \" What on earth was *that*?\" I suppose I thought. I saw societies build up from the caves, kingdoms and empires formed and swallowed up, wars fought, religions birthed from the words of mystic men somehow knowing of this elusive secret, deaths uncountable. I realized that the nagging truth, that bitter cup, the loneliness unknowable, all emotions and adjectives we use to describe our peculiar and particular experience as human beings, swelling up all around me in this void of dimensionless whatever. Surrounding me were the songs of birds, the crying of children, the laughter of a drunk, the orgiastic cries of lovers eloping. It had been me. Everything, all this time, whatever \" me\" was, uttered eternally in the Sanskrit as \" ta tvam asi\"... That thou art. In the chaos of that eternal song playing infinitely around me as a darkness edged the corners of that void, encroaching upon me now, soon I shall be swallowed, too! And so I screamed with a voice of a thousand thunder claps, \" Enough! Let there be light!\" And I awoke again to the softness of a breeze next to a stream where butterflies flitted and the voice of people calling my name. Where had I been, I wondered? Had it been a dream? I picked up my hat, lit a cigarette and forgot about it all.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He must be looking for attention.\" I tried my best to block out the chatter that came from my presence of walking down the street. The eyes of every passerby locked onto mine, wrinkled skin on the sides from their face, which were set into smiles. Mine were smooth, I only smiled when the situation called for it. It was the first sign to others that \" something was wrong\". As I made my way to therapy through the river of people that seemed to flow against me, my eyes caught a \" Happytosin\" on the side of a building. The bright yellow background seemed to have outshone the light given from the sun. A happy white couple smiled at me from the ad, almost staring into me. The words they loomed over in the center of the billboard claimed \" A smile is the key to happiness. Be the joy you want in the world\". Happytosin took America by storm. Marvin Arton claimed that it would put your mind at ease, and always make you smile. He had taken the saying \" a smile will trick you into being happy\" literally, and came out with a medicine to always make you look happy. It was n't required to be taken, but so many people used Happytosin, it was almost socially unacceptable not to. I had taken it for a few months, but it never made me feel happier. It made me feel as fake as I knew the smiles of my friends were on their vacation pictures, I knew they were having horrible times in Cabo. The smile that Happytosin forced you into was just another facade that you had to keep up with. \" Wow that guy must be trying really hard to be different.\" I looked wildly around at who had said that, and realized I was nearly late. -- -- - \" So Jack, how are you today?\" My therapist's wild smile gleamed across the room, legs crossed, hands folded on her lap. I shifted uncomfortably. \" I'm not doing great, I keep thinking about the breakup...\" My therapist's eyes twitched. \" I'm not doing great\". That was n't something you heard often anymore, even from therapists. Nobody wanted to expose their true feelings like I often do, why would you? You're supposed to be happy. \" You have n't found anyone else?\" \" It's hard to get to know people. My ex always said she was happy when she was n't. The dates I've been on, I never know if they're having fun. It's just always a stupid smile, and I ca n't tell if the words are fake.\" \" Are n't you being unfair to them?\" I stared into her beaming eyes. No twinkle of sarcasm. No hint of regret. It was getting so hard to read people. \" What do you mean?\" \" You should really let these things go. You do n't let yourself be happy! You know what's a great place to start? Happytosin. I'll call your psyc...\" \" I do n't fucking want Happytosin, I want to actually be happy!\" \" You do n't know what happiness feels like Jack. Your resistance to it is you wanting to be unhappy.\" My heart sunk. I could n't believe what she had said... people really equated this stupid medicine to happiness. \" When was the last time you smiled like this!\" she said, pointing at her teeth. \" Never because that looks psychotic.\" \" Allow yourself to be happy Jack.\" she pulled out a box of Happytosin. The yellow box seemed to brighten up the room. I stared at it and thought about all the times that I felt depressed the most, when I knew people could see I was sad. I wanted to be happy so badly, but actually happy. But how would I know that? \" I want to be actually happy...\" \" Take the first step. Show people you're taking the first step.\" \" What about for myself?\" \" How you show yourself to others is a reflection how you view yourself.\" she said slowly, eyes not moving off of me. The box opened. The gold pill sat in the palm of her hands, and in the middle of my mind. \" Take it.\" I took it. \" Here have some water.\" I started crying. \" It works instantly.\" \" I do n't want...\" \" Shhh... be happy.\" I gulped it down, water running down my throat almost as face as the tears were down my face. I did n't want to be one of them... I did n't. I felt my face warp. My cheeks got hot, as I felt them raise into a smile. My lips trembled as I tried to push into a regular resting face, but to no avail. I felt the cold wind against my teeth. I wanted to cover them, but my face would n't let me. \" Do you feel happy yet?\" I still thought about killing myself. I still thought about how fake I was. I still thought about the breakup. I wanted this torment to stop. But still... I said \" I feel great!\" Another smile seemed to have join my therapist's face. The last of my tears tasted salty as they entered my lips. I felt terrible, and now nobody would ever know.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

My mom died while giving birth to my little brother Andy when I was 8, and my dad descended into a bath of alcohol and his own tears until I was 14 years old, when he killed himself. Luckily, I was the one who found his lifeless body hanging from the ceiling, dripping blood from his wrists onto the bottle of Jack Daniels on the floor, and not my then 6 year old brother. From there things did n't really get better, but they did n't necessarily get much worse. How could they. We lived with my grandparents who had, let's just say, unorthodox parenting strategies. At 17 I could n't take it anymore, so I took what valuables I could and left. I got as far as I could with the gas in my grandfathers car, which I also stole, and I left it about 5 miles out of a town in Illinois called Bloomington. Nice place, if I remember correctly, but I did n't stay long. In Bloomington I worked at a Steak'n Shake for tips and a place to stay with a co-worker. I lived off of the $ 50 I stole from my grandparents, and by catering to snobby college kids who had everything but could n't see it, while I had lost everything and was picking up the pieces. Long story short, I was a bitter asshole who hated the world and everything in it. I even hated myself for leaving my brother with the pricks I used to live with. Even now, I do n't know how he's doing, and that's my fault. But I'm gon na be honest with you right now, while I still have the chance. I'm not here to tell you my sob story, or to hear you say sorry. I'm here to tell you about what I found last night, and you're gon na want to hear it. I was using the laptop that my roommate gave to me, the co-worker. She said I needed some way to stay with the times, or some other bullshit. To tell you the truth, I mostly used it to waste my time and watch porn. They're one in the same, really. I was looking at the vast array of lets-plays on YouTube for games I ca n't afford on a game system I would **never** afford, when I saw an ad for a \" Game of Life Strategy Guide\". I clicked on it to see what it was, because I had Ad-block, and it should have never appeared in the first place. It made me curious. I found a comprehensive walk through of **being me**. It detailed my life as if it was a videogame. It talked about acts in the game, the people in my life, difficulty levels, and, strangely enough, hidden power-ups. As I read and read and read, I relived everything I had ever experienced in more detail than I could remember on my own. The worst part about the whole thing were the power-ups. They were mockeries. \" Save your Father\" was one that it mentioned, that I guess I never found. There's more, 20 more, in fact, one for each year of my life. I've read the whole thing, up the last page where I die 8 years from now in a mugging, having done nothing in my life. But this book has changed since the last time I've read it. It's not set in stone, and I think I can save myself. If there's supposed to be a power-up for each year of my life, I have at least 8 to go.

{"input": "Two immortal lovers kill each other over and over again to stave off boredom.", "output": "Tan feet in gilded black metal sandals, I step onto into the burning sand. Slowly, the sunlight reaches my shins, then illuminates my long ebony tunic, it hits my pale eyes, then my long white hair, pulled into a high ponytail. And finally, for a good show, I fully unravel my large raven wings, revealing them to the ravenous crowds. I hear the people gasp in awe and admiration. Murmurs of excitement slowly ebs as opposite of me, on the other side of the wide sand arena, he emerges. Solemn as always, and warm eyes a little sad. Nevertheless his bloodthirst is even greater than my own, and so is his beauty. Long and lithe, pale feet wrapped by strands of delicate sandals, black hair curling softly about his forehead. His light, white tunic billows about him freely in the wind, constrained by no armour. The soldiers must have thought I needed a little help. He too, unravels his great white wings, and the crowd cries out at his beauty and the pity of what was about to happen. Little did they know our little secret, our deadly dance we so fancy to keep ourselves entertained in this unchanging world. He strikes fast, but I strike truest. He shoots towards me, long sword swinging in an upwards arc, grazing only my chin when it was meant for my eyes. Blood pours, but I do not feel anything but the wetness. I turn my body to dodge his next strike, and jumps over him, wings flapping once. Landing behind, I retrieve my sword from its sheath on my back. In one smooth motion, I aimed to server his leg tendons. He jumps just in time, meeting my sword with his own. Our metals clash and we push. Normally our strength is near matched, but he was in the dominant position. Above me, his sharp blade reaches closer and closer to my throat, my own pushing back shakily to delay the inevitable. His eyes, like puddles of water, looks down at me. I can see the small curve of a smile on his lips. His white wings were massive, blocking out the sun. There was a time, when we first fell in love, where he would never allow me to feel any hurt. An useless cause, due to our immortal states. Centuries passed and we found a better past-time than loving. Living forever dulls things. Feelings, once so sharp and new, no longer have the same strength or appeal. But dying always took that away, if only for the briefest of moments. The strong muscles on my back flex to bring one dark wing under him, sweepings out his legs. He roll backwards gracefully, and emerges on his feet, sword raised to fend off the strong blow I delivered from midair. Flapping his wings, he rise to meet me above the arena. I can see his blood running down one pale leg, from where I had grazed his torso. His small smile had turned to a grin, mirroring the same bloodthirty snarl I had from when I first entered the arena. Would it be a stretch to say our fighting gave a higher purpose to our lives? He strikes, I fend. I stab, he turns. The hot sun beating down on our back. Would it be a stretch to say I did not feel any love for him anymore, and only kept him around to stay entertained? A strong parry knocks me backwards. I nearly fall from my aloft position above the arena. The crowd was breathless now, I feel their excitement, humming in my veins. My very skin thrummed with my heartbeat. He charged straight and true while I was still unsteady, sword braced in front of him, blades pointing to my heart. I stopped my wings, just in time. The tip of his blade had caught the front of my tunic, ripping it open as I fell to Earth. I lay on the sand, wind knocked out of my lungs, my shirt open. He stands in midair and allows me time to rise, to take off my ripped shirt with my face impassive. The crowd roars in approval, the in disappointment as I tie the shreds around my naked chest. We continue our dance on the ground. My brutality and instincts returned to me. This time, I do n't go easy on him. Who was it that taught him the sword? I made cuts after cuts on his flawless skin, one after the other, until he collapsed onto the group, defeated. My hand closes like a vice around one pure white wing, and I rip from straight his shoulders, tendons and muscles flying. The deafening crowds is stunned to silence. Yes, I thought, admire me for my strength, for my mercilessness. As the blood stained his white tunic red, he reaches one slender hand around my ankles to pull himself up. I catch a glimpse of his dilated blue eyes. On his knees, he buries his face into my stomach, kissing it. One of my hands reach into his curly hair, grabbing it near the roots. Sharply, his beautiful head is yanked back. A blade is placed softly against his pale neck. I breath in the excitement of the crowd. I ride their exhilaration. He closes his eyes slowly and offer his neck to me. You win this time, I thought. And then I slit his throat.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Can I offer you some lemonade?\" I was already speeding in from kitchen where I could see the salesman at the couch. I was the wary sort, always on the lookout for my Grandma. Her trusting nature had gotten her swindled by Nigerian Princes and cash for gold salesmen before. I wheeled around the corner and she copped a toothy smile. \" There you are! Sam, this nice, clean cut young man is from the... what was it you called it again?\" I moved my eyes to the couch opposite her favorite chair where I man in his mid-thirties sat ramrod straight in a conservative blue suit. He did n't skip a beat and answered in a matter of fact tone as he stood and offered his credentials to me. \" The National Security Agency ma'am.\" I looked down in awed silence. Sure enough the size 48 font did n't lie. The words NSA showed in blue across the officially emblazoned ID. I passed it back to him with my mouth agape. He spoke. \" I'm certain you are wondering why I am here. Are you familiar with Stale Twinky?\" \" uhhh... no... I'm not.\" I sputtered. \" Perhaps you are more familiar with the name Muhammad Aziz Al Muhandez then?\" I cocked my head slightly, I was n't. The man held up a floppy disk. \" I assume you are the computer user in the house?\" he pointed his forehead towards me and raised his eyebrows accusingly. Grandma Marigold immediately perked up. \" I have a disk like that for my google!\" she exclaimed. \" Did you install it.\" He sounded accusing. I was about to end the conversation, get a lawyer when Grandma Marigold started in. \" Yes, I tried to install the google on it. It did n't work. It did have a game like on Sam's google. You tried to hit the little thing that moved. Did I win a prize? Can I get you a lemonade?\" The man stood immediately. I expected the worst. Assassination. Water boarding. Disappearance. The man extended his hand. \" Miss Marigold, on behalf of a grateful nation, I extend our greatest thanks. I'm sure you are expecting an explanation. You see. We made a minor mistake and failed to use the appropriate level of postage on a package we sent. It was supposed to go to a team codenamed Marigold in a location abroad. It was a direct link to allow them to control a drone to execute a kinetic strike against a target known as'Stale Twinky'who was actively acquiring a nuclear weapon. Your grandmother is a hero.\" He held the handshake for an awkwardly long amount of time until a single tear rolled from his eye and then quickly pulled it back to his briefcase. \" Now... please sign this non-disclosure agreements or I will have to terminate both of you immediately. The American people can never know of any of this.\" \" That sounds just fine, have I offered you a lemonade yet?\" We signed. The man quickly pulled the documents away and turned to leave. As he walked I had one question... \" Wait! Why the hell did you use a floppy disk?!\" The man turned. Without missing a beat he answered. \" If it fell into the wrong hands, seriously, who the hell still has a floppy drive?!\" And with that, he departed.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Or at least, he had n't for some time. The first run for President had warped daily life, to the point where even life's subtle indulgences became tinged with the embarrassing, obtuse politicking America had become known for. Rap music, basketball, cigarettes, anything that could possibly be used to make a racial slight had to be weeded out and eliminated. Not that he played much basketball anyway. Even the most powerful man in the world finds his joints growing sore. Breaking his eyes away from the teleprompter he glanced up into the house lights, hoping the blinding glare would somehow burn the memories from his mind. In two minutes and twenty four seconds he was on camera. Why was he thinking about rap music? He put his hands down at his sides and nervously rocked forward on his toes, rubbing his sweaty palms on his pant legs as his weak knees creaked in protest. One minute and fifty seconds. His arms felt like anvils as he lifted them clunkily back onto the podium. One minute forty three seconds. Looking down at his shoes the President tried to remember the breathing exercises he learned in college. In, two, three, hold, two, three, out two- what's this? A red fleck paraded itself on his clean white shirt, standing proud and alone next to his straight blue tie. Not a stain, a drop of something. Obama felt his blood boil up under his collar. Thirty years in politics. Two terms as President. How many press conferences, crisis, international negotiations? He had people for this, to manicure him and prep him for the lime light. Details like this were not his pay grade. He inspected the fleck gingerly with his thumbnail, furrowing his brow and scratching daintily so as not to spread it. Spaghetti sauce, from his 15 minutes of dinner. Just like his mother used to make. Mr. Obama could feel the anxiety welling up inside him as he looked back at the clock. One minute. No seconds. The President tried to regain his composure. He was more nervous than he had been in quite some time, but on the surface he appeared calm and ready. He tried to force himself to look as he had in his first term, when he first ordered bombs to be dropped in Pakistan. Ready to drop bombs, maybe. But not ready for this. Seventeen seconds. The teleprompter cuts out with a loud \" phupt\" \" What the fuck just happened!?\" \" Electrical failure on the prompter Mr. President. Camera's are all set, you have the notes in front of you.\" \" Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five-\" \" Wait a second I need a chance to revie-\" The TV manager gave him the go ahead - an obnoxious pointer finger cast from the shoulder like a fishing rod. \" My fellow Americans,\" He could n't do it. Palms sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy, spaghetti on his shirt, it all added up. He could n't remember what he wrote down, kept looking at the paper and back up but it just would n't stick. He could hear them, the American people crowded around their televisions, their criticism growing louder and louder. He tried to improvise, but when he opened his mouth the words just would n't come out. His throat tightened and choked as he struggled for a solution. Anything. Anything. Their shouts rang in his ears, the American people demanding what he could n't give them. Over and over, louder and louder. Demanding the truth. *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* *BEEEEEEEEEEEP* *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* Mr. Obama jolted awake. Snapped back to reality he tried to gain his bearings, shaking the weightless limbo feeling of vertigo one has after nightmares. The room was still dark, the White House quiet. Five AM wake ups had never gotten easier. Careful not to wake the First Lady the President slipped out of bed and into his slippers. Slowly so as not to let the hinges creak, he crept out into the hall and down to Oval Office, head darting too and fro much more like a rabbit than the defender of freedom. This level of weakness infuriated him. He refused to give up to his paranoia so easily. Swirling his chair around he logged onto his computer and opened Google Chrome. With three deft and defiant clicks Mr. Obama deleted his browser history, his search history, and cleared his cache. \" Lets see you assholes Freedom of Information Act **THAT**,\" he muttered to himself smugly.

Assemble kit. 4. Kill self. I spent a long time staring at those words on the paper. They did n't make me feel anything. I did n't become a sobbing mess covered in tears and snot. I just felt hollow. Completely and utterly empty. And that was terrifying. A burst of sharp knocks on my front door made me jump. I tightened my bathrobe and answered the door. A tall imposing man was on the other side, wearing a long black trench coat and reflective glasses. It was the white earpiece, though, that gave him away as some kind of government agent. He pushed past me and started sweeping through my house like he expected to find a group of bandits hidden somewhere. \" Um, excuse me?\" I called after the man. \" Oh, do n't worry about him Jason,\" a voice answered from behind me. I spun around. A short, pudgy man in a sweater vest was standing on my doorstep. \" What the hell is going on?\" I asked, so startled by what was happening that I did n't even think to ask how this man knew my name. \" He's checking for threats. The office insisted I bring a bodyguard with me. I, of course, told them that was ridiculous and that you certainly were n't any danger to me. But when the boss says you're taking a man with you, you take a man with you.\" The man smiled as if this explained everything. I stared hard at him. \" Oh,\" he said with a start. \" I've entirely forgotten my manners. I'm Bill Martin. Is it alright with you if I come in and talk?\" \" No-\" I started. \" We're clear,\" the agent said, suddenly reappearing behind me. I nodded without really thinking about it. Of course there was nothing to find. \" No,\" I started again. \" You ca n't come in. I have other plans for today, and do n't really have time to talk.\" \" I know all about your plans. In fact, you'll be surprised at just how much I know about you, Jason.\" Bill stepped inside and shut the door behind him. \" So let's sit down and talk. There's still plenty of time to kill yourself.\" His words came out so matter-of-factly, but they landed like a crisp slap on my face. \" How did you-\" I sputtered. \" I already told you. I know lots about you,\" he said, wrapping a reassuring arm around my shoulder as he led me to my living room. \" Are you spying on me? Who are you people?\" I asked as I sat down on the couch. \" I suppose technically, yes, we are. I'm the director for a special task force with the NSA.\" \" You guys think I'm some kind of terrorist!?\" \" No, no, Jason. The NSA collects Internet use data from, well, pretty much everywhere. Including here at home. But the identity of specific users is kept anonymous, and can only be accessed by us with the approval of a judge. And you're right, ordinarily we're going to a judge because of a security threat. We've just started a pilot program, though, to do'wellness checks'of sorts on people whose Internet history indicates they're a threat to themselves or others.\" I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. \" So what makes you think that's me?\" I interjected. Bill seemed to ignore my question. \" A judge signed a warrant allowing us to look at your data three days ago. Shortly after you had purchased a'suicide kit.'We observed you for a couple of days, and now I'm here to convince you that life is worth living.\" I hung my head, embarrassed at the situation. \" It's alright Jason. You're the sixth young person I've met with under this program. And each of them had their reasons. You do too.\" Bill reached into a briefcase and pulled out a hefty stack of papers. \" Here's your internet history for the last 9 months. You were happy back then. But the downward spiral is all right here. The death of your parents in that horrible plane crash. The loneliness. The way many of your so-called friends pulled away from you. Your questions. Your fears. All right here.\" I tried to stifle back a tear. It did n't work. \" How is this supposed to make me feel better?\" Bill smiled at me. \" It's not Jason. In fact, nothing I say can make you feel anything. That's the ugly truth about this world that no one seems to talk about. Your emotions are your own. And what you do with your life is up to you.\" \" Are you seriously trying to tell me to just lift myself up by my bootstraps? Put a smile on my face and everything will be better?\" Bill stood. \" Come with me.\" He led me back to my bedroom. \" What do you see?\" \" My room,\" I answered, still felling annoyed. Bill stepped in and picked up the list I had left on my desk. \" You're organized. Disciplined. Even though you made a list about how you were going to kill yourself today, you still made your bed. In the midst of your last months of depression, you still put away your clothes, and kept your room tidy.\" \" What difference does that make? What are you trying to tell me?\" \" You're still in control of your life. You've been dealt a shit hand, absolutely. But you still have options here. You have that drive in you to make some big changes, and start your life again.\" \" Why?\" I screamed. \" Why would I do that? Who cares if I kill myself?\" \" I care,\" he answered softly, looking right into my eyes. \" I did n't know you until three days ago. But now I know you better than yourself. If you do this, the world will lose something special. I care.\" I flapped my mouth trying to respond. But no words would come. Instead, tears welled up in my eyes and started streaming down my face. Bill walked over and wrapped me in a hug. \" It's okay,\" he whispered. He held me until I stopped crying. Then he walked me over to my desk, and pointed down at my list. \" Cross them off,\" he said. I picked up the pen, and crossed off the last three items on my list. \" Are you ready to start doing the work of making some changes?\" he asked. I nodded. \" Good.\" I felt a sharp pinch in the back of my neck. Everything went black. I woke up in a cot pressed up against the wall of a steel room. There was a little table next to the cot with a syringe full of a pale green liquid and a piece of paper. 1. Inject serum into your arm. 2. Go down to the mess for a hearty lunch. 3. Begin your training. 4. Take back your life. I smiled.

{"input": "At some point in their lives, all heroes make their way to the Ultimate Trials. [ WP ]", "output": "When Simon had woken up to two ogres stuffing him into a burlap sack, he hazarded a guess that today was not going to be an especially good day. As a shepherd's son, life had n't exactly been very exciting, and while he had wished for something to break the mundanity of sheep farming, being kidnapped was hardly what he had in mind. They had been traveling for what felt like hours now. The two ogres traveled by foot with Simon slung across one of their massive backs, and each and every step caused the sac to jostle just enough so that Simon could n't fall asleep again. Eventually, Simon noticed that the air began to smell different; the clean scents of the fields he'd grown up on ( well, as clean a scent as you can get being so close to an ogre's sweaty back ) had vanished, and in their place came air that smelled old and wet. Eventually, they stopped. Simon felt himself swing through the air, and land with a *thud* on the ground. The ogres untied his bag, and Simon saw where they had taken him. There were trees around them, though they were n't trees as Simon had ever seen them. These trees appeared to be dead, or very close to it, with wilted leaves that were a sickly shade of dark green, and bark as black as charcoal. But what really caught Simon's attention, was the building in front of him. It looked like a colosseum of some kind, with featureless walls constructed of grey stone, and two large doors constructed of the black bark of the trees around them. Just before the doors stood an old woman so stooped over that she was barely taller than a child. \" Mornin'Edna,\" said one of the ogres. \" Got the next one for ya.\" \" Yeah,\" said the other Ogre. \" But are you sure this is him? he looks tiny, even for a human.\" The old woman walked closer to them. As she approached, Simon noticed that her skin was as grey as the building behind her. She stopped right next to Simon, produced a mottled old book from somewhere deep within her robes, and began to read. \" Simon Pebershon?\" she asked, looking up from the book. \" What?\" replied Simon. \" Simon Pebershon. That's your name, is n't it?\" \"... Yes?\" The old woman closed the book. \" It's him alright. Honestly, the people they consider heroes these days... Anyways, come along inside. They crowd is getting impatient.\" The old woman began making her way to the large double doors, and with a flick of her hand they swung open. Before he could even stand up, one of the ogres picked Simon up by the head and carried him towards the entrance. \" Wait!\" said Simon, trying and failing to break free from the ogre's grasp. \" What's going on?! What is this place?!\" The old woman cackled. \" Welcome to the Ultimate Trials, boy, where all heroes meet their ends. And yours is today.\" Simon's heart began to beat faster. \" Hero?! I'm not a hero! Do I look like one to you?!\" \" No you do n't, sadly.\" replied the old woman. She pulled out the book from before. \" But, if your name appears in the'Book of Champions', you'll find yourself on the chopping block eventually, and as it happens, your name does. Now go on, the crowd's waiting. Oh, and do *try* to survive; it makes it much more entertaining to watch.\" The ogre led Simon through the black doors, and deposited him in a dark tunnel before turning back out. As the large doors behind him sealed shut, Simon saw a light at the other end. Seeing no other option, Simon ventured towards it, and entered into the heart of the colosseum. Simon found himself in a dirt arena, with noisy spectators on all sides. The stands were filled with ogres, goblins, and ghouls of all kinds, screaming for a bloodbath. Simon heard a gate behind him clang shut, and turned to find the tunnel sealed off by a metal grate. He was trapped. A war horn blew, and the crowd went wild. Simon saw a gate on the other side of the arena slowly lift up to reveal another tunnel. Almost instantly, a massive lion sprung from the mouth of the tunnel, snarling and roaring, and began barreling towards him. It would be on him in seconds. Simon panicked. What could he do? Just as the lion was upon him, he held out his hands to protect himself, closed his eyes, and prepared for the worst. Only it never came. Simon opened his eyes, and found the lion before him, not snarling as it was before, but lying calmly in front of him. Looking at it now, the lion was probably the largest animal Simon had ever seen, it was nearly two times his height *lying down*. \" Uh... \" Simon stammered. Was this supposed to happen? \" Greetings human,\" said the lion. Simon went wide eyed. \" You can talk?\" \" To you I can,\" answered the lion. \" I sense a hint of druid in you, I believe that is how.\" Simon had once heard his grandfather say that their ancestors were druids, but this was the first time he had seen actually proof of it. In the background, Simon could hear the crowd booing, disappointed that he had n't been mauled. In the back of his mind an idea began to form, but he needed to act quickly. \" What are you?\" he asked the lion. \" A creature from the mountains, far north of here. These wretched beings captured me many years ago, and have used me in these'trials'ever since. They prevented me from eating or sleeping to turn me into a mindless killer. I thank you for using your power to free me from my torment.\" \" Do you want to go back to the mountains?\" asked Simon. The lion's eyes opened wide. \" More than anything.\" \" Then I might be able to get us both out of here. Assuming that you'll help, of course.\" \" For my savior, anything.\" Simon went around the lion and clambered up onto his back, gripping onto the lions'fur as he climbed. Once he was up he sat as if he were riding a horse. \" See those guys up there?\" Simon said, pointing to the audience of monsters occupying the stands. \" Attack.\" And that was how Simon Pebershon, Master of Beasts ended the Ultimate Trials.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The sleeper awoke. Deep beneath the ocean he stirred, stretching limbs and tentacles and nameless things that had lain unmoving for ages. He climbed upward. The water tasted slightly off, a hint of long dead oily ooze. Faint noises buzzed in the ocean depths. A cobweb of mesh drifted in the water and briefly tangled on his great head, before he shook it off in quiver of disgust. His alien thoughts took on a distinctly uneasy tone. Something was n't right in his domain. The huge being continued up the continental slope and emerged from the water, optic clusters contracting in the bright sunlight. As his vision cleared he looked to the shore and saw an unexpected swarming, boiling hive of activity. Tiny pink and brown vermin wriggled disgustingly out of bizarre nests, all squares and right angles. Their tiny thoughts splattered against his mind, leaving a greasy residue. The smell of burning was strong in his tentacles. Even the air was full of unfamiliar shiny flying... things moving uncomfortably quickly. One spiraled towards him and he swatted it away. The greasy remains stained his hide. The Great One turned and sank quickly down toward the depths again, bile in his throat. At least the infestation seemed to be confined to the shallows and above. He shuddered again, pink wriggling masses filling his mind's eye. There were so many! Where had they come from? He idly scrubbed at the oily patch where one had impacted. Perhaps he should have done a better job cleaning up the great masses of organic material that collected in the ocean bottoms and were slowly buried under rock. Vermin often thrived on such untidiness. He settled onto an abyssal trench. High pressures were comforting, and helped him think. This world had been a good home for many eons, but the infestation above seemed extensive. It would be easy to destroy the hives, almost trivially so, but he would have to climb up there and _see_ them again. Squish them, undoubtedly get the imploded remains of nasty little minds all over his. And vermin were always fiendishly hard to eliminate. A few in a hole somewhere could explode in population again.

Through it all walked a mule, plodding ceaselessly through the destruction. Its footsteps were sure, avoiding flame and pit and briar with effortless care. The path it took meandered widely, though the man astride the mule seemed not to care. Hooded, his white robe stained with the smoke and blood of battle, he gave no direction to the mule, either not caring or not aware of their destination. \" Please... \" the voice was faint, but the mule heard it. Its ears flicked lightly, and the mule stopped, snorting wearily. It began to munch on what little grass remained in this place. The rider, as if taking his cue from the mule, dismounted. Reaching into one of the many saddlebags strapped across the mule's back, he pulled forth the end of a thin, grey rope. He pulled the rope along with him, and shortly found himself next to the source of the voice. \" Help me. \" said the body, and the rider saw that this one was not yet dead. His torso was rent by some terrible weapon, and his blood flowed weakly onto the dead grass. He would not last long. Still, the rider grasped the man's wrist, and placed the rope into his hands. \" Hold tight. \" said the rider, his voice a soft whisper. He returned to the mule, seeming not to hear the man's plaintive cries. The mule snorted as the man mounted, then resumed its steady plod, indifferent to the added burden, save that it took care to keep the rope from tangling. The mule's pace was unwavering, and the deep black smoke that hung over the sky gave no sign as to the time. At times, it would stop, hearing some sound, and the man would dismount. Another rope, another survivor. The mule's burden grew, by tens, by hundreds. It carried on regardless. Some fell away, but always there were more. After a time, the sound of hoofbeats drew near, and out of the blackness rode three of the four Horsemen that had wrought this madness. All who had lived and died on these fields knew them. War, Pestilence, Famine. They rode directly up to the mule, who had stopped upon hearing the sound. The stallions of the horsemen neighed and reared, taunting the smaller creature. The mule lowered its head, munching on a mouthful of grass. \" Ah, it's our little brother! \" shouted War. He always seemed to shout, even when his mouth was shut. His golden armour gleamed, the brightest light in the surrounding gloom. He held a broad silver blade in his hand, and its sheathe seemed the only part of his attire lacking any sign of wear. The white charger beneath him dug angrily at the ground, its blood red eyes trying to catch the mule's gaze and deliver a challenge. The mule ate on, unconcerned. \" What a sorry procession! Are any of those fit for battle? \" The rider of the mule said nothing. A few of those behind the mule dragged themselves to their feet, dropping their ropes. They fell in behind War. \" A pitiful enough lot. Still, I shall make use of them. Until next time, brother! \" A few hard yanks turned the stubborn charger's head, and War rode away, his fresh recruits in tow. \" I do not know why you bother. These are mine. \" The emaciated hand of Famine reached out, and a dozen of the mule's ropes fell slack. Still, the rider said nothing. He merely drew in the slack ropes, packing them neatly into his saddlebags. \" I sense my touch on them as well. I take my own. \" A putrescent mass cloaked in a loose sleeve gestured, and a dozen more ropes went slack. A dozen more dropped their ropes, and fell in behind Pestilence, carriers of his diseases. \" Well, I suppose the rest are yours, for now. \" said Famine. \" Pointless though it is. You know we will get them all in the end, do n't you? \" He seemed to expect a reply, but the man on the mule said nothing. Indeed, he gave no sign that he even saw his brothers. Shrugging, Famine wheeled his horse about, and Pestilence followed. The mule continued munching on grass, and the rider dismounted. He made his way among the freshly dead arrayed out behind him, and found a few that still clung weakly to life, despite the ministrations of his brothers. He placed a rope in each of their hands. Some released it immediately, too far gone, but a few clung weakly. When he had done all he could, he mounted the mule again, and they began to pick their way through the battlefield.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Somehow, you've managed to befriend her and things have started getting weird...", "output": "I'd be lying to you if I told you that I've paid much attention to her in the past. She was just there; someone peripheral. Maybe it was I who chose to ignore her, or she just chose not to be noticed. I saw her on my way home from work. I was not in the best of moods, for work had lost its luster that I once thought it had. I was brooding, pondering the nihilism of it all. It all happened so awkwardly, for she was beautiful. She was far more beautiful than I had ever noticed. As I stood there in admiration of her allure, I forgot that this was really happening. \" Yo.\" she said plainly \" Yo?\" I asked, as if I had never really heard the expression, as if I was a stranger in a strange land. \" you know, like, hi.\" she retorted \" Oh! yes, hi!\" I said louder than I meant to. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, a memory came to my mind. She looked familiar. Her face shifted from my peripherals into my sights. I knew her. I have always known her. Memories of my childhood rushed forth. She had always been a quite one living in the corner of my eye, never in full focus. \" I know you do n't I?\" I asked, with my index finger on my lips, and a half smile on my face. \" I do n't know, do you?\" she answered with a chuckle. \" Yeah we went to school together!\" I said, again, a little louder than I wanted to say. \" YES!\" She replied in a mocking manner, followed by a laughter, as if she was aware and understood my social anxiety. I was surprised. I did n't expect that kind of response, but I too followed along with the laughter. \" We hung out once before, ya know?\" She said after the laughter died out. \" You came into the gas station I was working at. I believe you were on your on way back home from a date that did n't go as planned.\" She added as she looked straight into my soul. I stood there in amazement. She had dug up a memory that I'd thought to be forgotten. A painful night indeed. Now the focus of the night did not lie in the date, but more so on the moods that had made it a bad date. These moods came from something more insidious than the constant existential crisis that I had been, and am currently going through. This affect of pain came from constant years of abuse at home. Things that I would rather not mention. That night I remember a girl at the gas station that saw my pain. A girl who understood me with out the use of words, someone who knew me more than I knew me. \" I am approaching you because I recognize that face. Not just the features, but the mood... the pain in your face.\" She said remembering that night so long ago. What was I supposed to say? I was at a lack of words, and thought for that matter. I just stood there not sure what to do with my hands, face, or feet positioning. Where do I look? Every time I stare back at her it's like looking down the barrel of a gun! She lays her hand on my shoulder and asks. \" What are you doing tonight?\" And with out giving me room to respond she she says. \" I am going to go get a drink at this beautiful rooftop bar about two blocks away... I think you should come hang out.\" \" Sure.\" I said, still taking in all the emotions whirling like a hurricane. Without ordering our drinks we leaned on the guardrails. Just like that night, I did n't need to say a word to feel the cumfort of her being near. We just stood there and a drop of water fell on my hand. It was a clear night, but more water dripped on my hands as I hovered over them. She just stood next to me rubbing my back, as I vented my moods with silence. \" Shhhhhhh.... there, there.\" she repeated. There was that comfort that I felt so long ago. She proceeded to give me a hug, as she swayed me from side to side, leaning on the rail and away from the rail. My tears have stopped. She kisses me as we continue rocking from side to side. And with one last sway, we are propelled off the building into oblivion. I am reminded of something I read long ago, as we free fall. A poem in Spanish by Jorge L. Borges. It translates a bit like this. The Enigmas I who am singing these lines today Will be tomorrow the enigmatic corpse Who dwells in a realm, magical and barren, Without a before or an after or a when. So say the mystics. I say I believe Myself undeserving of Heaven or of Hell, But make no predictions. Each man's tale Shifts like the watery forms of Proteus. What errant labyrinth, what blinding flash Of splendor and glory shall become my fate When the end of this adventure presents me with The curious experience of death?

The ear piece he'd taken out began to chatter and buzz loudly. The voices that commanded him to speak a moment prior seemed confused at what he was doing. He took off his thin, square glasses, throttled the microphone off its stand, and pushed over the podium that he hated. The crowd in front of him looked on with confusion. He unbuttoned his grey suit coat, and tossed it to the ground. *I'll not stand for this any longer*, he thought as he let his gaze wash over the people in front of him. He ripped off the ear piece dangling from his under shirt and tossed it behind him. He began once more, \" Our world is falling to ruin. You, the people are afraid; the government is corrupt; the police kill the innocent and by-standing, and you are the only possible disrupt...\" \" We all are human: Men and women just as afraid as the next standing by your side.

We're too caught up in our own lives, to even start to realize, that the fabric of it all, is beginning to tear and shred,\" he looked out at the crowd that came to see him speak, and he finally spoke *his* voice. \" And yet, \" he said looking down, tears beginning to well in his eyes, \" our deepest virtues argue exactly the opposite: Let there be light; Let there be love; Love thy neighbor as you would yourself; aspire to be better than your were yesterday, and give to the world, each and every day. Our deepest virtues are a reflection of the people we hope to be... so why do we act as we do?\" He looked around, half expecting an answer from the gasping crowd and found none. \" Because the system in place has invaded your space; the deepest depths of your hearts and minds,\" he said as the tears began to fall. \" You've let the system tell you how to live your lives: Be born. Go to school. Make friends. Find a talent. Have fun. Go to school. Be an adult, or whatever that means. Get a job. Get a wife. Have a son. Find a house. Be in debt. Work your life away, and be free in death, having lived only to *die*,\" he roared at the crowd in front of him. He paced along the wooden stage in silence and let that sink in. The sun beat down on his face, and for the first time, he felt free. \" You walk down the streets day by day and do n't consider how regimented all of our existence has become. You live YOUR life, blissfully unaware of the hurt around you. You consider YOUR strife and forget about the worries of the world; the very chaos that's threatening to envelope us all. You chase YOUR dreams and toss aside the dreams of the people around you and forget along the way that WE ARE ALL ONE IN THE SAME...\" he let the microphone fall to his side as tears of rage fell to floor. He looked up. Some people were crying in the crowd. Others looked mortified. The one emotion he saw by and large was reflection: perhaps for the first time for some. He brought the microphone back up to his face. \" We all want to be happy... each and every one of us. We all want to find peace within ourselves and within the people we hold dear. Our common virtues speak louder than all the words that the world has spoken. And still, we cling to the system in place, for fear of the change that would arise, as a result of something different,\" he pleaded to the crowd with his eyes. \" Given all of this, there is only one thing that we WILL do: WE WILL RISE,\" he said screaming at last, letting all his rage flow from his being. \" We the people will rise up against the system, as our ancestors have done before! We will tear down the structure of corruption and fear that has so controlled our lives, and we will step into the dawn of a new age! An age of peace and happiness and togetherness not predicted or seen before...\" he paced helplessly along the stage and looked at the crowd of quiet people. He let that last sentence ring through the air. The sun beat down from the sky, and the wind blew through the air. On the edge of that setting stage, the man with the microphone stared. He saw in their eyes a gleaming hope; a smoldering ember, one that threatened to burst aflame. He brought the microphone to his mouth one last time, \" I can not be your politician. I can not pretend to represent all of your voices, for once I swear that oath, my voice belongs to them; the system in place. I wish you all the best of luck, in your endeavors to change the world...\" he dropped the microphone. It bounced on the stage and squealed loudly over the speakers.

Shall we get started then, master?\" The man replied. \" Fine, if you are real then let me talk to my future wife.\" Alex requested still doubtful but curious. The genie waved his hands and they were in a room with strange equipment he had never seen. Soon he realized it was a physical therapy room.

She gripped the rails on the side tightly. She panted and gripped her metal and plastic leg. Her arm had burns scared over all along it and when she looked up the left side of her face also held some scars. Her brown eyes showed delight as she took another step and made it to the top of the platform. Her blond hair was sticking to her face. Her efforts causing her to sweat. \" I see a capable woman. Also the answer to your request.\" \" You do n't understand. I was in the car my buddy was driving. We were coming from a party and both of us were drunk. Him even more so, but I let him drive anyway. We ran a stop sign at the same time Emily drove through. Her car rolled and caught fire. We called the fire department and the cops. I tried to pull her out but could n't. She was unconscious and by the time helped arrive she had third degree burns. She even lost her leg because of how it was pinned in the car. She.....she ca n't forgive me!\" Alex exclaimed. She was his friend until then. Now he avoided her. \" The future holds many surprises, and you will never know until you try.

Though he did hear the genies voice again momentarily \" No turning back now.\" He took a deep breath and began walking to the other side of the room. He gently cleared his throat when he was close to her and was met with brown eyes staring at him. \" Alex?\" She asked wearily. Alex could feel the strange atmosphere in the room and could n't think how to start.This was only the beginning of the long journey of the rest of their lives all he had to do was speak. \" Hi\" Emily smiled and he was pulled into a gentle hug \" Where have you been silly?

The sound of pressure being released barely registers in my brain as I try desperately to adjust to the light. I slowly ease my eyes open, and I come face to face with a middle aged man. He is smiling, and though much of his face is obscured by a thick brown beard there is something familiar about it, and the twinkle in his eyes reminds softly of someone I know. For a brief, terrifying second, I convince myself that I have died, that this light is heaven, and that this man is Jesus. And then my senses rush back into my head like water from a broken dam \" …Tom?\" The sound of my own voice shocks me…how long as it been since I have heard my own voice? The man smiled \" It's been a while Alex\" \" You've … changed\" At this the man laughed – a deep, chortling laugh that echoed through the room. He looked back at me, and his eyes met mine. And I knew. There was no doubt that this man was the brother I had said goodbye to so many years ago. He had the same goofy smile and bright, twinkling brown eyes. Eyes that were full of wonder, joy, michief and filled with loving armth. \" How…how hold are you?\" I asked \" 49\" \" 49!\" The number echoed in my head. *Forty nine*. He was 14 when I last saw him…which must mean he had been awake for… \" Yep – I've been up and about for 35 years now. Mostly on my own\" \" Mostly?\" \" I woke mum up a couple decades ago…and dad too. Told them about my situation. They were sad, and disappointed of course…but i hope they understood\" \" What situation Thomas…? What do you mean Mum and Dad understanding? Are we not…are we not at the destination?\" \" No…we're about 250 years away\" And then memories came back. The Great Journey they called it. Half the entire population of earth – 4 billion people, crammed into thousands of monolithic ships, all headed towards the same destination; all headed for a new start, a new planet, and a new hope that we would get it right this time. They had called them Genesis frigates – behemoths designed to withstand the brutal conditions of space, and be self sustaining long enough to take it's payload to the final destination: some distant star light years away that was said to contain the future of humanity. \" So then why are we awake? Should n't we go back to sleep? More importantly, why have you stayed awake for 35 years?\" My brother stood up and turned around - I couldn't help but notice how tall he was \" Because I was tired of sleeping Alex. I first awoke 500 years after we started. Calibration error. It soon fixed itself and I slept again. When I woke for the second time…something changed. I no longer wanted to sleep…so I looked around\" He paused, and turned around. \" Do you know what I found?\" I shook my head \" We're alone Alex. Just us. Nothing out there but the blackness of space. They never told us that. How black space is. We were taught it was all twinkling stars and beautiful nebulas…but for the most part, it's just black\" \" I mean yea I guess it is, but…hang on. You said we were alone? But were n't there other ships?\" My brother gave me a rueful smile \" Yes, there were. Or rather…there are. They're just not with us anymore\" \" What do you mean? What happened? Did we go off course?\" \" Not at all. We're right on course and right on target to arrive in another quarter millennia. It's just that we'll be the only ones that arrive\" \" Then what happened to the others? \" They will arrive at their destination, but it is n't not our destination. We were lead to believe that we would be joined by the rest of our brethren, and that humanity would start anew as one. This was a lie\" I nodded. My brother continued \" What actually happened was that they sent each ship off in a different direction. They did htis because they did n't know for sure which world could or couldn't sustain life – and our leaders did n't want to put all our eggs in one basket so to speak. But they could n't tell us this, and so they wove a web of lies, and lead us to believe that a new life was awaiting us all at the end of our journey, whereas in reality no one really knows\" We were silent for a while before I finally spoke: \" So we could be headed to somewhere we ca n't live…at all? \" Precisely. And then we waste away, peacefully in our sleep. You can understand now sis, why I decided not to sleep anymore\" \" But…I don't… \" I know you're feeling helpless Alex. But I've discovered a way! We can be free! We do n't have to waste away\" \" I do n't understand\" \" I do n't expect you to now…but trust me\" I felt a flash of anger. Tom was being cryptic again. He would always do this back when we were children; always refusing to give you a straight answer when he knew something you did n't know. It would be insufferable too, since it always seemed to be something you really wanted to know about. \" Thomas.\" I enunciated his name with perhaps a little more than a slight tinge of annoyance \" Tell me what's going on. You ca n't expect to wake me up, tell me the last 750 years have been a lie, and then ask me to'trust you'without a little more info. So explain yourself. Please\" My brother smiled again, which only served to annoy me further, and said \" Rather, let me show you\" At this he turned and started walking away. I glared at his back for a few seconds before making a move to follow him. As I sat up a wave of dizziness washed over me and nearly forced me back into my seat. I suppose it has been a while since I've used any of my muscles. I tried again. Another wave of dizziness, but this time my arms gave out and I flopped painfully back into the pod. Thomas's footsteps stopped. I looked up – he was already quite some distance away. \" What's the hold up sis?\" He called back \" Were n't you always the'athletic one'in the family? I barely had any trouble getting up when I woke\" Shooting him a dark look, I clenched my teeth, and slowly lifted myself out and onto my feet. Wobbling as I stood up, I looked to Thomas with a triumphant glance. He had already begun walking away. Typical. As we made our way through the ocean of life pods ( me following some distance after him…learning to walk is apparently much harder the second time around ) I began to think about what Thomas had said. Was really true? Was it all a lie? I trusted my brother, but at the same time it was still difficult to accept. I soon caught up to him. He was waiting at what looked like an elevator door. He pressed a button and with a silent whirr the doors slid open. Motioning me inside, Thomas pressed another button *Whump* \" You ok Alex?\" \" Huh? Yea I'm fine\" The sudden and rapid change in motion had knocked me to the floor. However, I was too busy looking out the other side to notice, because below us, expanding in every direction, was the ship \" How…how big is this place Tom?\" \" 2.5 million sq.m, 5km from end to end. Enough room for 4 million life pods, engines, life support systems, everything\" I nodded wordlessly. I had been told the Generation Frigates were big…but I had never really understood the vastness of such a ship until I had seen it from above. \" What exactly are we traveling on right now Tom? And where are we going?\" \" Of course, I should have explained a bit better. You'll have to excuse my impoliteness; you do n't really come across the need to explain things when you're alone\" My prior annoyance against immediately faded. How could I have forgotten? He spent 35 years by himself. I should be glad he's not completely insane. \" We are currently on the Rapid External Kinetic Transport, or REKT for short. I presume you're now well aware of how it got it's name. We're currently traveling along the outer edges of the Genesis frigate, towards the front of the ship where the bridgeis located. Your pod and mine are located near the midships, and given that Geneisis Frigates tend to be rather large, the REKT was designed for easy transport from one place to the next. \" How does it work? Why are we so far above the ship? And why does it seem like nothing is preventing us from…well, you know…falling?\" \" I'm not too sure on the details, but my understanding is that we're connected through some electromagnetic tether which slings us around and around the circumference of the ship like a screw until we reach our final destination\" \" Why not a normal elevator?\" \" Has to do with gravity I think. Something about up and down being the same thing in space making traditional transport methods difficult to deal with\" We fell silent as the REKT took us up the length of the ship. Soon, we landed in front of a set of doors. The words \" Bridge\" were spray painted outside of them. They slid open and we walked out. \" Voila!\" I slowly looked around. Across from me was a large viewport into space. Dotted around the room were a few screens showing statuses of various systems. In one corner there lay a makeshift…alcove of sorts. I presumed this is where my brother slept. I turned back to him \" Thomas…I do n't see anything\" He grabbed my arm and dragged me towards the viewport \" Look!\" he shouted, beaming at me with that smile that was always too big for his face, with eyes that always had a bright twinkle to them. Eyes that now had something…different \" Thomas\" I began \" all I see is space\" He turned back to the viewport. \" Look at it sis! It's all ou there for the taking! We can take it! You and me! \" Thomas there's nothing out there. Come on, let's go back to sleep-\" \" No. I belong here. I belong out there. It's calling to me… \" Tom... let's go back\" He turned to me. His smile was gone. \" You go sis. I told you already. I'm tired of sleeping\" \" Come on Thomas. Do n't be ridiculous\" He turned his back to me, and gazed out into the black \" Tom please\" \" It was good to see you again sis. I'm glad I got to see you again\" \" Thomas just come with me…\" … \" Tom …\" ….", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Your own parents smirk.", "output": "My parents abandoned me at the age of eleven. I never learned why, just that I never heard from them again after that day apart from the single card they sent me once a year on my birthday. As my adoptive parents could attest, I always say watching the mail slot with bated breath on that day, waiting for just a few words scrawled on the cheap Hallmark paper. Then one day the cards stopped coming. I was eighteen at that point, and they had lost most of their magic anyway, so I was n't too upset. About a month after my last Card Day I moved across the country to attend college. For the next four years no letter came, and despite graduating with honors from a business program, I have to admit I still felt a bit crestfallen each year when June 6th came around. When I was twenty-seven and running a small advertising company in Vancouver, I hired a secretary fresh out of college. Ever the perpetuator of stereotypes, the boss ended up sleeping with the secretary and a year later we were married. Less than a month after that, she became pregnant with our first child, a boy. My wife, Laurel, and I chose to name him Nicholas Alexander after my adoptive father and her brother, respectively. The pregnancy flew by without a hitch, and before I knew it we were packing out bags for the hospital. Unfortunately for Laurel, the labor was long and painful. However, that gave the relatives ample time to visit. Her parents came first, followed by my adoptive parents. While my wife surrounded herself with her folks and my adoptive mother, my adoptive father pulled me aside. \" There is something I have been meaning to tell you for a long time, kiddo,\" he said. \" Father to s- er, yeah.\" \" Huh?\" I figured it was something to do with my birth parents, though we'd never really discussed them before. He sighed. \" Well, kiddo, I just want to make sure you're gon na be there for this little one no matter what.\" He frowned. \" I mean, Aunt Lil and I love you very much and we are so glad we got to raise you, but-\" \" I got it, Uncle Nick.\" This was always my name for them. Aunt Lil and Uncle Nick. The doctor and his housewife. They were of no relation to me, but were apparently acquaintances my parents before I was forced upon them and my parents bolted. Suddenly, I heard a loud yell from the room. Laurel's parents and Aunt Lil hurried out and pushed me inside, smiling warmly. I took my wife's hand just as Nicholas made his screaming entrance into the world. A few minutes later, Laurel and I looked at each other in shock as we simultaneously heard our son speak for the first time. *Mama... papa* The nurse must have seen the combined look of horror and amazement on our faces because she quickly came up to the bed and whispered, \" It's always hard to swallow the first time. But you'll get used to hearing him. Oh, and make sure you never tell him you hear.\" And so we did n't. Nicholas's thoughts were simplistic at first, but as he learned more about language and the world around him, his kind blossomed. We quickly realized that he was quite a precocious little boy. Not every thought came through clearly, but several times a day we could hear his little inner voice shout the details of his thoughts, ranging from *I have to go potty* to *Were mama and papa born old? * Of course, the question that always rode at the back of *my* mind regarded my adoptive parents'ability to hear my thoughts. Out of respect, I never asked it, but four years later during the birth of my second child the topic came up with Aunt Lil. \" Can you hear me think?!\" The words shout out of my mouth as if I had spat them at her. She chuckled and shook her head gently. \" No, and thank god for that.\" \" Yeah...\" I smiled crookedly. \" What about my real, er, uh... birth parents?\" Her face turn dark and her whole body straightened, as if she had just touched an electric fence. \" Let's go and check on your lady, shall we?\" *** Nicholas and our daughter, Rosie, grew up healthy and happy. Miraculously, neither Laurel nor I even heard either of them think a majorly objectionable thought, although we agreed that even if we did we would let bygones be bygones. Why punish them for a reason we could n't provide? One Christmas when Nicholas was fifteen and Rosie was eleven, Uncle Nick was extremely quiet. I sat next to him on the couch while the women and kids baked cookies in the kitchen. \" You alright?\" \" Yeah, yeah. Just I'm getting older is all.\" He stared into his lap. I put my arm around him. \" Tell me what's wrong.\" \" Look at her,\" he said, gesturing toward the open door. Just inside it, Rosie ran around with a batter-covered spoon. \" She's eleven now. That's how old-\" \" I know, Uncle Nick.\" \" No, but... she's different. I know you love her. And I know Laurel does too. You two do so well with those kids.\" He looked up at me. \" You do so well.\" \" Well thanks,\" I replied. \" But,\" he sighed, \" I need to know. Do you love them? Without a doubt, do you love them?\" \" Of course!\" I said incredulously. \" I'm not like them! I'm not my dad, and Laurel is not my mom! We would never-\" \" That's not what I'm talking about.\" Uncle Nick out a hand on my knee. \" Do you remember what they were like?\" \" Who, my mom and dad? Well yeah. Mom was, er, she had curly hair, I think, and dad...\" Why could n't I remember? I was n't incredibly young when they had abandoned me. Maybe it was scrambled, or- \" Come on, tell me what you remember!\" \" Well I remember, uh...\" He was glaring at me now, gripping my knee tightly. \" Do you remember *anything*?!\" \" I... no. I do n't.\" The grip on my leg relaxed and he spoke softer. \" Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.\" He paused. \" But I guess now is as good a time as ever to tell you why you're here.\" \" I was n't abandoned?\" \" No, you were, but the circumstances were a bit unique. When you were a little kiddo, you were happy and full of life. And you were *smart*. You were *so* smart, and your mom and pops were so proud of you. They loved you more than anything in the world. \" But as you got older, things changed. You got into trouble a lot. Soon you got violent and would fight with your parents for hours. And then you started to *think* violent, too. Oh god, kiddo, you thought up some bad things.\" My heart was pounding. \" Like what?\" \" Well, kiddo, you thought about killing your folks. Scared the living daylights out of them, because you thought about it day and night.\" \" No,\" I gasped. \" I would n't have!\" \" But you did. So they took you to a doctor who said he could help you. Said he could fix you and make you be a normal kiddo again. And he did, all right, but then your parents left you and never showed up again.\" \" That doctor was you,\" I said. \" Yes, that doctor was me.\" \" And the cards?\" \" That was you Aunt Lil and I, too.\" Something flashed in his eyes. \" I'm sorry I did n't tell you sooner, kiddo, but as they say ignorance is bliss.\" I looked at him for a moment and grinned. \" Yeah, it sure is.\" It all happened in a second. I pulled the pistol from the waistband of my jeans and fired two rounds into his skull. From the kitchen echoed both real and thought-exclamations of \" *Oh my god what the hell was that*?!\" I walked in the kitchen and shot Aunt Lil, Nicholas, and Laurel. When I turned to get Rosie, however, she had disappeared. \" Oh, come on,\" I said. \" Come out come out, wherever you are!\" *Papa, no. * it came from the corner cupboard, her thought-voice, barely a whisper.

{"input": "Identify one of your deeply held beliefs. Make a serious attempt to disprove it.", "output": "I happen to believe that there is no ultimate purpose to existence. To some, this might spark the memory of discussions with atheists past. To others, it might bring up the dreary drudgery of a middle school hallway brimming with the anthems of the Emo and the lost. Or perhaps it might be what you yourself have rested upon up as the fundamental truth to this existence that we find ourselves in. I consider myself to be a rational person. But in reality all that really means is that I at least make a conscious effort to be rational. I like most others are filled with internal inconsistencies and subjective beliefs with no backing in logic. So perhaps this belief that I feel is very sound is not actually so certain and that there is in fact a purpose to all of this. This would mean there was a cause and we are the effect. This would mean that there is a goal that every single particle is indirectly helping to attain. As conscious, chemical computers formed from stardust we could have a central role trying to attain this goal, or perhaps more cynically we in reality play no greater part than that Quark in the pixel on your screen. If there was a purpose to all of this, could that mean that we have already attained the goal and finished the job? But would n't that render us now purposeless in an infinite sandbox mode after finishing the main story line? I suppose that the opposite claim of my assertion is that there exists at least one purpose to existence, which unfortunately would leave room for the fact that the purpose of existence could have been just to exist. Perhaps the creation of spontaneously developing intelligent life was the purpose and thus we are the subject of an award winning paper of an ecstatic denizen of the 12th dimension who began our universe as a simulation. Speaking of denizens of the 12th dimension, if God exists does that mean there is a purpose to existence? I suppose yes there would have to be a purpose to at least our existence assuming that God played an active role in creating us, for anything that is done deliberately is done for a reason. If, however, you take a more liberal view on God such that he only constructed the laws of physics and then decided to let things take their natural course, there would n't be a specific purpose for our existence. Yet more interesting, what if our purpose is to help God understand what his purpose is? That might sound like an impossible task and perhaps it is. Who is to say that our purpose would be an achievable one. While most would hope to find solace in a purpose of our existence, I can think of all too many purposes that would be as hollow and bleak as the absence of one. All of the cases discussed so far all rely on the existence of something ( or someone ) that likely can never be proven or disproven. Is there an argument for purpose that does not rely on these predicates? Can not a purpose for existence be posed by the very beings that exist? Why must something else have the power of determining what the plan for our race is and what our ultimate fate should be. A pristine universe with no obligations, no storyline and no end should harken back to the analogy to the infinite sandbox games of the like of minecraft. Is there a purpose to minecraft? Some would say survive. Some would say have fun. Some would say whatever you want it to be. Maybe there is wisdom in those blocks.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He considered any time wasted as something sinful. Gunther also had another strength – Mathematics, he knew that this was the key to getting out of his fathers clutches.

Ivan for all his oafishness took a deep interest to chess, and his father knew that this was the key to lift them out of poverty. He encouraged his son to play chess all the time, and he also realized that this kept him out of trouble. An engaged mind does not become the devil's workshop easily. War came when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and Hans who gained an exemption from the draft once in 1940 ( his engineering studies were considered vital to the state ) could not avoid it in 1942. The war, clearly was not going as well for Germany as Goebbels spouted on the radio daily. His father though believed that absolute victory was but only a month away! His father was a fool. Gunther was drafted, and in basic, his training officer noted that the boy had an eye for target shooting. He had an uncanny ability to quickly establish the trajectory of a bullet, a skill that one was either born with or only came with a lot of experience, and could take really long shots…very accurately. Gunther was then assigned to Sniper school on the basis of a personal recommendation from the Camp Kommandant. After graduating from Sniper school as one of the school's youngest graduates, he was assigned to the 12th Infantry Division, LVII corps, 6th Army. Ivan signed up to the army the moment the winter war with Finland started. As he was only 16 then, his application was rejected, but he was called up in 1941….Mother Russia was bleeding men, and needed yet more to staunch it was the paradox of Russia at war. His natural athleticism came into the fore, and he was quickly spotted by his training NCO. He was offered a chance to go to the Officers school outside of Archangelsk, but in a fit of romanticism, he rejected the offer. He wanted to serve with the men he had trained with. As a compromise he was offered the role of a Corporal. He was assigned to the 18th Infantry Division, 8th Army to be a part of the valiant defense of Stalingrad. Ivan got his first look at Stalingrad from the Western bank of the Volga, and he felt fear for the first time in his life. The Eastern bank was being assaulted by German units, and he & his men were to be rushed straight into battle. He calmed his nerves, took charge of his men and listened to Sargent Yakov bellow his orders, \" Any man caught running back will be shot, any man surrendering to the enemy will have his entire family shot, any man not fighting to his best abilities would be assigned to a penal battalion, your Motherland cries out for you, go out and defend her \" HUZZZZAAAAH! And with that cry, they boarded the barge assigned to them. Shells landed all over them, a pair of Stuka's circled the sky's like ravenous vultures waiting to feast on engorged flesh, and would lazily dive with that infernal siren on and bomb an unfortunate boat. A leg and a decapitated head landed on their barge…the owners of these parts already dead and spared of pain & misery. They inched closer, and this allowed the Germans to stonk them with mortars, and the machine guns opened up, their bullets playing out some form of macabre death dance known only to the hands that held the trigger. The partner it chose to dance with would die, and there was no way to reject its choice. Death was all around them, it was random, painful and all prevalent. The shells exploding around them reduced their hearing to minimal levels so that they heard the world through a fog almost. Water exploded in violent geysers all around them, and yet more vultures joined the fray…it was quite simply a turkey shoot for them. Gunther his ear plugs on to cut sound, took position in the destroyed remnants of a water tower. It was an exposed position, and one wrong move would lead to deduction and violent death, but all it required for him was to stay still, unmoving a rock! It also had an exceptional view of the landing docks and potentially could result in him taking out some commissar or maybe even a general. Gunther had quietly applied his mathematical talents and become an exceptional sniper. His specialty was lying in wait in potentially exposed positions and taking out key elements of the Soviet command and control structure. He hated all the praise and adulation that came his way, he hated the medals, all he wanted to do was study mathematics and build stuff, not be shooting Russians. It was a job to him, an unpleasant one, but one that he had to get through to get to what he truly wanted. Ivan yelled at his men to hit the docks and keep moving, his natural instincts as a warrior helped him instinctively realize that, under heavy fire his men's first response would be to take cover but movement was the key to survival. His men despite his orders got bogged down the moment they left the docks, a heavy MG opened up on their right flank and Ivan knew that left unchecked it would wipe out his small command. However its attention was elsewhere at this moment. With his Sarge dead, his Lieutenant blasted to bits by Shrapnel on the barge... he was in command. He got up, blew on the whistle he picked up from the dead body of Sargent Yakov, blew it and asked his men to form up on him. Sudden movement on the docks caught Gunther's eye – He saw that a MG nest was in a rather exposed position and a Russian squad was about to flank it. He saw a figure jump out and violently gesticulate its arms while blowing on a whistle. He saw men frozen in places of cover – cover which was only illusionary from a sniper bullet, but one that would serve as a placebo. He lined up the shot, the figure in his sights also co-operated by stopping to berate one of his men. He took it. Ivan collapsed in a heap – his last thought was that he wanted to be in any place but this and he got his wish, for he soon reached a place where nobody could reach him, hurt him or even touch him.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

A big white blob floating a foot off the ground with crude yellow facial features in the shape of a big dumb toothy smile. \" Does your Niece realize I do n't have a face?

Nelson threw the radio at Sata, phasing through his face and hitting the wall behind him as he lunged off the couch and to the closet to get his uniform. \" That was pretty rude, dude.\" Complained Sata as his core bounced around and re-positioned itself like a ping pong in a bowl of jello. Nelson slammed his door and tore apart his closet getting semi-presentable. Nelson rushed out the door while he put on his jacket, Sata floating after him.

The colours in front of her blurred as the white melted into the brown of the trees and soon horizontal lines waved across her vision. She collapsed into the snow. The blood spread out about her, crimson wings to fly away and leave this place forever. Wait though, this is wrong, she thought, no I do n't want to anymore I've changed my mind. The warmth of her blood, the heat instilled in every drop from her heart, melted the snow and branches and twigs began to show around her. Snow melted on her face almost as soon as it touched her skin. She tried to lift her head but she was powerless; all her energy and life was leaving her through self-inflicted slits in her wrists. Looking up at the canopy snowflakes danced through the bare branches above like outspread skeletal limbs being sheared of their surface; they're dying again, she thought, the trees are being flayed. She wanted to reach out but could n't. The snow moved in patterns as it was pushed around by different aspects of the environment. The wind, air pressure, obstacles, all decide the course of the snow and the snow can not help itself. It just falls. Now the snow did n't melt so quickly and was beginning to form a blanket over her features whiting over everything. Again, she thought, wo n't fall again. Try again. Her eyes still open seemed glassy but continued to reflect the light of the moon above. The moon at the top of its arc would soon drop and disappear, but only for a time as it would rise again. Again, she thought. The snow piled higher all over her; the blood crimson that had melted the snow was again being turned white.

Most of them could n't have been much older than 25, a good 60 years younger then I. I downed the rest of my scotch and resolved myself to go and join them. As I turned on my heel to head outside there was a slow knocking on my bedroom door. Confused, I opened it. A drenched girl stood before me, possibly the most attractive I've ever seen, and I've seen my fair share. \" Hello there\" I said through my expectant smile. She pushed her burning red hair behind her ear and looked at me coyly, \" It's been awhile\" she said and took off her bathing suit. \" Has it?\" I said, dazed and looking everywhere but her face. \" A very long time,\" She said, pushing me toward the bed. I fell backwards onto my king sized bed, looking into her eyes. Her red eyes explored mine, \" Nice contacts\" I observed. \" No baby, I'm natural. You do n't recognize me huh?\" I hardly cared, \" No but no time for making memories like the present!\" She did n't look satisfied with that answer, \" Maybe this will help.\" Her face suddenly shifted, grotesquely twisted and morphed into the face of a twenty-something business man. I shrieked and skirted my way back in the bed as this creature let out a hearty laugh. \" Sorry mate, I just love the look on your faces when I do this.\" Then it clicked, I knew this day would come. \" It's… It's you is n't it?\" He appeared in a puff of smoke standing beside my bed, now dressed immaculately in a suit, stroking his sharp goatee. \" In the flesh- more or less.\" He smiled, well, devilishly. \" So,\" He said. \" Was it worth it?\" I thought back on the years of drugs, money, fame, adoration, and sex. \" Sure as hell was.\" I said. The devil laughed, \" I like you,\" he reached out his hand to shake. I took it hesitantly, he shook vigorously. \" People are always crying in the end when I come, spare me this and give me more time that. As if that'll get them anywhere.\" I swallowed, trying to stay composed, \" So what now?\" I asked tentatively. He leaned over me excitedly, I could tell he loved this. \" Well!\" He nearly shouted, \" First I'm going to take your soul, which is going to hurt, and is going to kill you.\" I'm sure I must have looked visibly shaken. He continued, \" Then the fun stuff starts!\" He pranced frighteningly to the foot of my bed. \" You like to party? You're gon na love hell, everyone interesting makes it there: Elvis, Alexander the Great, Genghis Kahn,\" He put his hand by his mouth and whispered, \" Even Gandhi!\" he winked at me. I perked up at this, \" What about all the burning and whatnot?\" he stood back, \" I'm no monster, I rebelled but hey, so did George Washington eh?\" He laughed, \" The fire and brimstone are for people like Dahmer, Macy.\" The devil looked me in the eye, \" How would i have any fun if I threw the most exciting people in the fire?\" I smiled back for the first time, \" Okay lets do this\" I said, mentally preparing myself for the agony that was sure to follow. He grinned and repeated, \" I like you\" while walking over to me. We locked eye as he leaned close and reared his hand back. \" See you on the other side!\" He bellowed and drove his hand in to my chest.

Unfortunately the freezing cold wants to watch too.

By now his wooden walls were covered in notes, names and even sketches of strange figures. After finally locating a spot, he sat back down and continued to peer through his broken old window, rubbing his hands together trying to stay warm. Felbury was only a small mining town with just under a hundred residents. Its only source of wealth came from the coal mine, two minutes down the path by Sean's holiday cottage. Since visiting, he couldn't help but notice a... peculiarity with the locals. It was 5:50 AM, Sean was expecting to see them anytime soon. By now the fog was so dense he could've well been living inside a cloud. He could barely see the path outside. The heavens opened and rain began to pitter-patter against the thatch roof. Droplets leaked onto his arm, but he remained unmoved. Suddenly, he heard squelching footsteps. They were here. A figure emerged from a break in the fog, heading down the path. At first he appeared like any other normal person, however as he came into view he was anything but. The man was completely naked with nothing but a fully grown tuna balanced on his head and a pickaxe grasped in his hand. The tuna was still twitching. Sean was left dumbstruck. The man vanished back into the fog. Not long after two more miners covered in a thick layer of what could only be described as horse shit skipped out of the fog swinging their pickaxes whilst singing'*For he's a jolly good fellow*'. Their voices faded back into silence. Many more miners passed, each more bizarre than the last. Sean sketched it all down as fast as he could till there was nothing left to document. Hours later the fog had finally subsided. Sean had finally finished pinning everything to the wall, he took a step back and shook his head at how utterly absurd the situation was. His walls resembled the work of a mad man. It was now late in the evening and the miners were due to be heading back soon, this time Sean decided to confront them. He put on his thick leather jacket, grabbed his lamp and headed outside. Stood on the path, he thought to himself who was he going to see, what would they look like. He grabbed his hip flask and took a sip from his dwindling supply of whiskey. The sound of talking echoed nearby. The miners began to walk by. Unable to see clearly, Sean nervously lifted the lamp. The light revealed a middle aged man dressed in dirty blue overalls with a pickaxe resting on one shoulder and breathing apparatus strapped to his belt.

He worked his way back to her face and saw her look away. He eyed her sleek black hair, brown sugar skin, exposed arms. He sped up. The stops were getting more frequent, more unpredictable, more *exciting*. Jerome felt his cock pressing against his khaki pants.

No bra underneath. \" Oh baby, you goin'sexy for me.\" Jerome placed both hands on the binoculars and tightened his grip. The woman paused then headed to the dresser by her bed. She opened a draw and pulled out a black hand gun. Jerome froze. She cocked it with both hands and used one to place the barrel on her heart. Jerome's heart began racing.

{"input": "The most you've ever hated yourself.", "output": "The unique thing about hate -- the most sinister thing -- is that you do n't recognize you're in the throes of it when you have it. One second you're cool and collected and the next you're spitting fire and seeing red. It's only after the fact that you realize just exactly what you were feeling or what you've done. Nobody, really, chooses to be angry or hateful -- it's something you fall into: the abyss you miss until you're disappearing into its depths. Until you're drowning in the black tar. So, no, I never knew the moment when I looked into the mirror and despised what I saw, or when I received an \" A\" on a paper and just earned a headache, nor do I remember the first time I had food set in front of me and felt my stomach ping with hollow pain. I do n't recall when the sound of my own voice drew my ire, or when love lost it's color. When I saw myself as nothing, and my eyes became opaque monochrome. The thing about hate is that you never know when it's over or when it will end. It's not there until you're in it and it's gone when you begin to feel it. It makes you believe that you're weak, stupid, fat, slow, impossible, and that you ca n't live without it. Sometimes you stop and try to remember when you did n't have it, maybe when you were 13? 9? A toddler? An infant? But you never can tell -- the hate will make you forget it. So you try to bury it. Maybe it wo n't happen again, hell, maybe I just dreamt it. Maybe I am doing the best I can, maybe I am like everyone else, maybe the hate \" I\" harbors for \" me\" is n't special -- maybe... Maybe you can go back to school, maybe you can have a career, maybe I can bring myself to eat today, maybe I can finally shower, maybe, *maybe*, I can pull myself out of bed. See the thing about hate, and think about this, is when you feel it, you feel it so completely you do n't feel anything else. There's no joy, or happiness, or forgiveness, or mercy, or fear, or love or empathy. Just. The. Hate. I dance and drink, eat and fap -- whatever I can to forget that I ca n't stand myself.

Every single item in here is a priceless gem. \" He appeared to roll his eyes. \" Ok, well be that as it may – we really must get going. If you don't want to come with me then fine, but I have very important matters to attend to. \" \" Aha! \" I exclaimed, \" I found it! \" I pulled out a leather satchel from the shelf and withdrew the contents. \" You see, \" I explained, \" I'm slow cooking a particular cut of venison, and I can not for the life of me decide which wine to pair with it. Do you think the Pinot Noir would be better, or the Riesling? \" \" What is this…I thought you had something important to show me. \" The man's face darkened, and he turned to leave. \" Ah! The Pinot Noir it is then! \" And with that I bashed the bottle of Riesling over his head and simultaneously stabbed the man in the heart with the wooden stake I had in my other hand. He let out an unholy howl as I bore down with the stake. \" Come on then! You vampires are getting really lazy these days. Do you know how many times they've come to the door and said the same thing as you? You're making my job too easy! \" And indeed it was. I was a vampire hunter, and I didn't even have to go out hunting anymore. You would think these vampires would learn not to keep coming to my door. Then again, they're so anti-social that they never even talk amongst themselves. Fine with me. When he was dead, I burned his corpse out back as I enjoyed a glass of the pinot noir. I wasn't lying about the venison either. It was delicious.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "Something is looming over the horizon. Most people are running in fear... but some are wandering closer", "output": "My uncle tells a story from when he was a rookie on a police force in a small town in rural Ontario. During my childhood a shining silver water tower was always present on top of a large hill above town. I did n't question its history. It was just always there. One day, when I was back from college visiting my grandparents, my uncle showed up for dinner. He was a quiet man. My aunt talked constantly and he never had the opportunity to say anything so at family gatherings he usually just sat silently nursing a beer. On this occasion my aunt was n't present and I was pleased to find that my uncle, who had, at this point, been a cop for over 35 years, was quite the story teller and had a lot of funny/crazy stories to tell. One of these stories concerned the day they installed the town's water tower. I ca n't remember the year but it was when my uncle was a rookie so it must have been in the late 1960s. The tower's base was already built. The last piece was the the tank for the top. The tank, which was a large metallic ellipsoid, had been assembled elsewhere and was being trucked in for installation. The thing was gigantic. So large that they had to transport it on two flat bed tractor trailer trucks. The trucks had to drive side by side at a slow speed so the tank would remain secure on top. The top of the tank towered high above the trucks'cabs so they had to take a route around the outskirts of town through farm land to avoid power and phone lines. Due to the nature of the transportation it was decided that the tank would be moved early on a Sunday morning when there would be little to no traffic. My uncle, dressed in his uniform, was stationed at an intersection outside of town to control traffic, not that there was any at this time on a Sunday morning. The sun was just rising when he heard the low growl of twin diesel engines straining to carry their massive payload up a steep hill. The engines, running in low gear, created a sound that reverberated around the country side. A phasing rumble that my uncle described as \" otherworldly,\" like nothing he had ever heard. As he stood and waited for the trucks to come into view a farmer rode up on a bicycle and stopped next to my uncle. They exchanged a brief nod of acknowledgement and my uncle returned his gaze to the horizon while the farmer dismounted from his bike and joined him, curious as to what could make such a disconcerting sound. At that moment, the top dome of the tank rose above the hill in front of them. The rising sun struck its metallic surface and the shine it created concealed the tanks seams and rivets, making it look smooth and flawless. As the saucer shaped tank kept climbing higher over the horizon, the cabs still out of site, the farmer's eyes grew wide with a mixture of horror and amazement. He looked to my uncle for some sort of answer. My uncle, noticing the man's agitated state, turned to him and, with a stern and serious look etched on his face, said, \" They just landed this morning. We still do n't know what they want.\" Well, as my uncle tells it, that farmer jumped on his bicycle and rode like hell in the opposite direction.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

A mumbled'raito'turns on the lone light bulb in the room and washes the room in its warm electric glow. Dressing does n't take long, as all the students at Mahoukotoro have to wear the same uniform everyday. Black slacks: check. White collared shirt with tie: check. Since it was supposed to be summer, the coat gets left in the closet. Not that it really matters, since the temperature is always the same down in the Geofront Magical Prefecture. Stepping out from his dorm room, Ryota joins the mass of other students headed towards the classroom building. Exiting the boys Dormitory, the worn pathway to the rest of campus is lit by the evenly-placed lamp posts and lined by worn shrubs desperate for the light. the low talking of the students is occasionally interrupted by the sound of the school mascot Gojira pacing by the guarded entrance to the Prefecture. \" Hey Hashi!\" a girly voice calls out. Looking behind him, a short girl with bright orange hair catches up to him. While odd hair colors are fairly common among the magically-inclined, the ginger locks of Akane Tachibana definitely stand out in the crowd. \" Hey Tachibana, what's up?\" Panting slightly from the exertion of catching up, she matches pace with Ryota. \" Oh, nothing much.

He dropped his mug of coffee, his glasses fell from his nose, he ran towards the control room as time seemed to slow down and he could not believe what he'd just seen. They'd been trained to spot a nuclear missile, and to respond to a nuclear missile, but more than 1500... It had to be a systems malfunction, the cold war had ended! Tripping over himself he stormed into the control room, of which the door had remained unlocked; a dreadful sign. Military staff members, technicians, operators, they stood in the room with red lights illuminating them from all sides. The alarms had been silenced, only the sound of one man could be heard: President Vladimir Putin, whose face was plastered on even the tiniest of screens, a face drained of power, unlike the Russian bear it once represented. The president stood not in his office, but before the National Assembly of the Russian Federation, the president was not on the phone, but his face, his beaten-down features, were visible in high-definition. There was no doubt now that the radar had been correct, but why the silence? Mother Russia would defend herself! Retaliate! The missiles would be shot down before they even reached Russia and finally the United States, which other country could have sent the missiles, would finally be exposed for the criminals they are! He focussed on the speech of the Russian President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, father of the fatherland, defender of all the Rus'. He expected to hear the exact words that had rendered him hopeful once more also from the mouth of the national hero, but instead he heard the classified last words of a broken man... \" Deputies of the Duma... Representatives of the Federation Council... Friends, and former enemies... Russia will not retaliate against the United States of America for the launch of at least 1500 nuclear-armed missiles currently expected to destroy any trace of the Russian Federation.\" A shock went through the control room, but silently, no one dared to utter a word. \" We will not alert the general citizens, it will bring me solace to know that the people of our glorious country died without mortal fear: it will be Russia's last of many victories...\" Vladimir Putin, the unmovable rock; a tear dropped from his eyes and slid past his cheek, only to fall to the floor and disappear. It had seemed like an illusion, but more tears followed as the emotional president continued his speech with shaking voice. \" Who are we, always having fought with the best interests of our own citizens at heart, to retaliate in a way that no longer would bring any benefit to us? Who are we, never **ONCE** having committed the monstrosity of using a nuclear weapon, to respond to such an act, not of war but simply of pure crime, with a similar atrocity, breach of fundamental human morals. It it in the interest of the Russian citizens to dismantle a world they will no longer live in, I ask you? The answer is no.\" The silence in the National Assembly of the Russian Federation was the only applause that the president could be lauded with, the silence of acceptance, the silence of those who were in everything but flesh already dead. \" We are all dust, and to dust we shall return. I propose we, the only ones who share in the knowledge of our faith, go down together: as equals. A symbolical dismantling, an acceptance, a last deed, if only to do anything... I ask the National Assembly of the Russian Federation to disband all federal organisations.\" A vote, an honest vote, was cast: unanimously all federal organisations, including the Russian army, were disbanded. Several officers in the control room saluted the president and took off their medals, laid them down in front of them. \" I ask the National Assembly of the Russian Federation, due to the inevitability of the end of the Russian Federation, to disband the State Duma.\" Unanimously the former-deputies of the Duma had ended their mandate. Party differences, election fraud, personal feuds, they were all cast aside. They were all dust. \" I ask the National Assembly of the Russian Federation, due to the inevitability of the end of the Russian Federation, to disband the Federation council.\" Unanimously the former-representatives of the Federation Council had ended their mandate. Soon, their birthplaces, as they knew, would be federal subject no more... Soon, their birthplaces, as they knew, would be no more... \" Let us hold a moment of silence, for today die the people of the Rus'.\" He needed not ask, not a sound was to be heard. \" Today dies Vladimir the Great, first Grand Prince of Kiev; his legacy I failed to protect.\" Silence. \" Today dies Rurik, who united our people for the first time; today dies Catherine the Great, bringing a true end to the Catherinian era...\" Silence. \" Today dies Nicholas II a second death, more cruel even than the first, and with him die those who had him slain. The Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, both fallen and yet they fall today.\" Not silence, but the sound of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the last president of Russia, the manifestation of the Russian bear, not being able to hold back his tears... With him, many others... \" Their legacy, I failed to protect... But they stand by me, I believe they stand by me as I dismantle for their honour that for which they died to build... I, Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation... By the power invested in my by the disbanded State Duma... By the disbanded Federation Council... Calling upon all those who came before me... Hereby...\" Despite the impending absolute end, it seemed impossible that he would... \" Grand full autonomy, independence and sovereignty to the federal subjects of the Russian Federation...\" The National Assembly was now composed of men of different nationalities, bound only by their fate to come. The end was nearing, it could be felt in the air. \" I swore an oath the protect the interests of the Russian citizens, my citizens, and of the Russian Federation, my motherland. Over my terms as president and minister-president I believe fully to have fulfilled this duty to the fullest extend of my abilities. **Never** did I back down when a matter concerned by beloved country-men, my brothers, never did I abandon them when their were lost and alone, when they were pained under foreign rule.\" Only silence to be heard, even the plants and the animals made not a sound; Mother Russia herself bemoaned the fate of her children. \" I, Vladimir Vlarimirovich Putin, fully believing to have fulfilled my oath as President of the Russian Federation to the best of my abilities, salute those who die with me today, present, past, and future, those whose legacy I could not defend, and offer to Mother Russia herself, may she rest in peace, my resignation.\" He stood in a room of corpses, their breath the only thing still separating them from the earth they and their predecessors had walked. \" Mother... Forgive me... For I have failed you...\" *For all men are equal at the moment of death and who are we to judge them when a much greater judge awaits? * -- - Writer's note: making the United States deal with the guilt?

Dale's moment of pure nostalgia was cut short by a frail voice squeaking through the door. \" Secret knock. Please. \" Dale took a patient step back and leaned up against the door. \" Come on honey. You know it's me. I'm tired of this secret knock nonsense. \" A moment of silence followed before the voice crept out again. \" Secret knock. Please. Now.

He brushed his knuckles against the same old worn out spot in the door just as he had done for the past ten months. Every day Dale ignored it. He would come home and twist the door handle, hoping one day it would be unlocked. But of course the door was locked, it had been for the past ten months. Every day Dale would knock half heartedly on the door one or two times, hoping that it would swing open with his wife to greet him. But of course the door never did swing open after knocking one or two times, it never has for the past ten months. Every day Dale will contest Sarah, telling her that there's no need for a secret knock when the only person that comes in the house is her husband.

The predator inched closer, his head leaning back, massive jaws opening wide, about to strike... **SNAP! ** From the forest, behind the predator. The strange animal spun about, startled, and saw the looming stalker about to devour him. It screamed, staggered backwards and fell on its backside, and skittered back towards a tree.

He spun his head around, peering back into the dark treeline where his tail extended, and saw nothing. He turned back to his prey; it was on two feet again, running away, yelling \" Help!\" in its native tongue. The predator tried to chase, but again could n't move. He twisted around, clutching at his tail, and then he saw them: a pair of eyes low to the ground, glowing a fiery orange in the dark of the forest. They started to rise, and the body of the monster became visible, glowing the same fiery orange from within. Like the monster's insides themselves were aflame. It had the predator by the tail in one massive clawed hand, standing upright on two legs. The predator moved without thinking, stretching its massive body all the way around to sink its razor sharp teeth... into its own tail, ripping it off in one powerful, painful chomp. *Flee. Water. Safety. * The monster was right behind it, roaring, lighting up the night with fire from its very lungs. The predator smelled a new smell, one he'd never smelt before. The smell of burning flesh. He could feel his back blistering, bubbling. *FASTER. * The massive lizard lurched to the left, following the smell of the lake from where he came. Seconds later, a massive boulder landed where he had just been. *CLOSE. * The predator could feel the dirt turning back to mud, and soon the mud ended, replaced with the cool, murky water of the lake. He heard another scream from the animal he had been hunting. He did n't stop. He swam, staying under water, trying desperately to avoid that flaming breath. He reached the underwater entrance to his cave and slipped inside, back onto dry land, and looked back to see if he had been pursued. The cold water sloshed idly against the cave wall. He had made it. He dipped his tail in the water, letting the cleaner fish eat away the burned and dead flesh. He smelled the smell he had smelled before, the smell of the strange, bipedal creature who was new to his world, but different. Diluted by a new smell. The smell of blood varied so little between meals, he easily identified it. His jaws slavering, he looked towards the land entrance to his cave, where the smell was coming from.

{"input": "You were born with the ability to know how a person will die just by looking at them. You've kept this ability a secret and learned to live with your entire life. Until the day your granddaughter was born...", "output": "As far back as I can remember, I've seen the faces of the fallen. The first time I was twelve, my mother had just been killed in my father's twisted murder-suicide plot. One morning, months after it happened, I made eye contact with a beautiful redheaded girl from my school. She was tall, green eyed with skin like alabaster and curly flame-colored tendrils that danced when she moved. In the second that our paths crossed I saw a flash of the upperclassman with a peaceful look on her face while her eyes slowly became distant; as the image came into focus, I could see the rest of her dying body in the bathtub of a cheap hotel room, warm water up to her chest the same dark red color as her prom dress. She had taken her step-father's strait razor and sliced her arms from wrist to elbow. I quickly broke the eye contact with her and started looking down as I walked between classes. The vision was horrifying and within a week I started seeing the end of the lives of my friends. The shy boy who sat next to me would have his skull beaten in by homophobic rednecks. Two sisters would be shot down on the street in a drug bust gone bad, the popular basketball player would wrap his dad's Camaro around the base of a palm tree, my then-best friend would loose her fight to breast cancer. The rest of my school life would be filled with the often violent and saddening passing of my peers. The only safe haven I had was at home with my grandparents. They would live long enough to meet my first child, and peacefully pass away in the middle of the night holding the other's hand, the coroner would report that their deaths was caused by a gas leak. Right after college, I met a man at a coffee shop on my way to work. He was running late for his own job and had bumped into me causing both of us to drop our cups. The young attorney apologized over and over, bought me a replacement beverage and left his phone number on the side. With a final glance at me before leaving to tackle his day, I saw him a few decades older, laying in a hospital bed. This man was handsome even in death, he would gently squeeze the hand of his wife, bring the hand up to his lips to give her his final kiss as the nurse put a small dosage of morphine into his IV. His blue eyes would close for the last time and his passing would be a gentle one. The young man and I began seeing each other, after a few years we married then I became pregnant with our first child. The pregnancy and deliver filled me with absolute dread, this curse of mine would show me the fate of my daughter. I prayed for her to have a long and peaceful life. I hoped she would move to the country and die in her sleep surrounded by those who loved her. The day of the delivery went smoothly, and after they handed me this little bundle I began to cry. When she opened her eyes for the first time I saw her as an adult. She would leave this world driving home, in the rain, hit by a drunk driver. The vision never changed and only grew more clear with time. No matter if I was watching my three year old smiling and laughing, I would also get the vision of her head tilted to side, her neck broken and eyes vacant. As her mother, I wanted to protect her, but I knew there was nothing I could do. She grew up to be a willful teenager as I was too busy watching her for signs that maybe the visions were hereditary to actually be a decent parent. She became pregnant at seventeen and while I wanted to be disappointed I also knew how short her life would be. Two days after her eighteenth she gave birth to a daughter of her own. My husband and I were at the hospital to hold our daughter's hand through the delivery. My husband held the baby as our child slept, reminiscing about how he could n't believe how small our granddaughter was. He passed her off to me and I waited for her eyes to open. She was perfect with little tufts of red hair poking out all over. My granddaughter finally opened her big green eyes, suddenly I'm back in the hallway of my middle school, surrounded by the faceless mass of my peers. My granddaughter, a beautiful girl with alabaster skin and curly flame-colored tendrils that danced when she moved, would lock herself in the bathroom of cheap hotel and open up the veins in her arms from wrist to elbow.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Xander chuckled and said: \" Oh good, new slayer chick is a wannabe ninja turtle.\" \" I see the vampires were n't vapid enough, you had to surround yourself with beings you ca n't stab in the heart.\" Droned Daria. Gilles removed his glasses and began wiping them with a cloth. \" Well, I'm sure Daria will be useful in the battle against Angelus.\" He said, Britishly. \" Oh yes, the vampire who also has a tendency to turn into a vicious killing machine. There's a healthy relationship model.\" \" How do you know about the curse?\" Asked Buffy. \" I read it, in the book of vampires, which I assume would be useful reading for someone who slays vampires.\" Said Daria. Buffy said: \" It does n't matter, tonight we'll go finish him off.\" \" Tonight? How about instead of attacking them when they are at the strongest, we try burning down their hovel in the daytime.

The ball of the hammer came down completely unseen by myself and hit hard, shattering my forehead into unrecognizable chunks.

I bumped the glass of water earlier and forgot about it, it drained into the drawer and did n't bother to pick it up. I wanted to get a jump on her birthday to cook for her. \" Shit, Glenn!\" she looked at me as I placed her food over her lap, \" My phone is in the drawer!\" As soon as I placed the food down, she quickly moved it over to my side of the bed. \" I'm... Sorry?\" I looked at her, not even 9 a.m. and we have beef. \" Yes, I should have cleaned it up but I wanted to get started on the day for you.\" \" I could have cooked for myself, I know you want to get to work to see that fucking bitch.\" She reached in the drawer and put her feet on the floor. \" Shit, the screen is being pissy!\" She always wore a tank top and briefs to bed, she took off her tank top and started wiping down the drawer and her phone. \" Do n't do that babe, I'll get it.\" I walk over and she looks at me, \" I do n't want to do this today.

I told them we had plans and they said they will upgrade the reservation.\" She was calling from her work phone, I could hear someone in the back ground but she was still upset with me. \" Well, they are spending the day with me and I know you made reservations at Vinny's.\" Woman knows me like the back of her hand. \" Your right, and I'm fine with it. I'll call, okay?\" I waited for her reply, \" I'll see you later okay? You have a good rest of the day babe.\" She hung up, I do n't know why it's dragging on today but it is starting to get on my nerves. I pull into the parking lot, get my ticket, park, and get on the elevator. \" Hey.\" It was the girl from my barbershop, \" How's it going Glenny boy?\" She had a bandana in her hair, showing off her tattoo sleeve, and wearing a tight shirt. She was trying to flirt with me again, she always did this when I got my hair cut, sit down in the chair next to me and talk with my barber and I while she was waiting for her customers. \" Hey Jeanette. How is it going today?\" I lean back in the elevator as it begins to descend. She tells me of whats happening with her, how her boyfriend dumped her, and recommended a piece of jewelry that she thought Annie would like. It was n't her but I still liked the piece, so I bought it. Annie could try something new. We said our goodbyes and I lost my parking slip while looking for flowers, this was going to be long. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \" Late again, Glenn!\" It was Annie's dad. \" You always seem to be behind, must be a minority thing.\" I was offended, but he was an asshole like that even on our wedding day.'It looks like a powwow in there', I heard him say at the reception. He was always on my case and a asshole about it. \" Well Mr. Hawthorne, some of us actually put effort in gifts and they take longer.\" I smiled and attempted a retort, \" We do n't all have assistants to order around.\" \" Just like a Native American, drinking before 6 p.m.\" He walks away, what an asshole. Annie sat by her mom talking about her clients, Annie did wedding planning and was really good at it, but she also did consulting and PR which was our real income. Her stubbornness was tiring, but it is what made her a good at her jobs. I could see my whole life with her, and she was my high school sweetheart. \" Happy birthday to you...\" I wheeled out a cake that I planned with Vinny to bake for her, we had a private room and all her friends were present. I wanted to propose to her tonight but I think a more intimate setting will be good. So I am going to do it in about a week. It was the first smile she gave me in three days, she blew out the candles and we spent another hour with everyone. When we got home, she blew my mind with sex I've never had with her before. It might have been her strawberry mixed drinks. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \" Hey Mr. Ralph,\" The customer service rep came out the back with Annie's phone, \" So, we fixed her.

This is the phone of Annie Hawthorne and Glenn Smith?\" He looks at the model, turns it on and checks the info. \" Ah, yep. Annie Hawthorne, but, uh.\" He looks at me and back at the phone. I grab it from him and look at the screen. Ralph:'Hey babe, what you doing tonight'Annie:'Sitting in with the boring boyfriend.: <'Ralph:'Just say you have a client and come out with me, we can have some fun later!; )'Annie:'Or how about we just go straight to fun, and then go out?'I stand in shock, the service rep knew this was going to be an awkward place to be. So he tried to switch to, \" So, with the repairs. We are not charging you because you have protection, I'm just going to need that back and I'll print you off a receipt so you can get through the door.\" He started working quickly on his till while I browsed her chat history with'Ralph'. On the way home, I looked at her phone like it was laughing at me. It was two months of them first messing around, that was when she started fighting me a lot too. I opened the jewelry I just bought, it was an engagement ring. \" Well, that was fast.\" I just pulled out a loan in my name too for her wedding planning, the house is in her name, and I have n't spoken to my friends in a few years.'What am I going to do?'I say to myself, I call the barber shop.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Eyes open. We are going into the forest.\" Uneasiness wrapped itself upon Kara's presence. Kara glanced upwards and only saw a looming forest, which seemed to be staring right into Kara's murky, brown eyes. Such a forest evoked Kara's unpleasant memories; memories of blood-red fields, destroyed villages. How could we enter such a forest, she had thought. It would be suicide to enter such an environment! \" We must ponder upon our choices before entering. I never experienced such an encroaching feeling ever since... ever since that place.\" \" Nonsense Kara! How can anything be worse than that place? Perhaps, you would like to return to that place?\" \" No! Nothing but that! I believe there is an alternative path, a path more pleasant and blissful that this scene of foreboding.

Only one path remains for our freedom, and it's this path. We must pull forward.\" Impatient was Michael as his hands shook deliberately. Yet, Kara continued to balk upon the forest entrance. She shook her head twice and turned her back against the forest. \" Michael, I do n't think I can do this anymore. This path to freedom; who knows if it exists. I am going to head back to the place. I can not bear to continue advancing towards a place of uncertainty. Who knows what is out there.\" \" This is the final chance that I'm going to give you, Kara. You can choose to take a chance of freedom or choose to return back to guaranteed oppression. I can not move forward if you continue to lack faith in my knowledge.\" \" My final answer is no.
