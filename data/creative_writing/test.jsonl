Allow me to introduce my colleagues, Senor Cologne who is the senior curator here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Madame Solange, who will be representing the Board of Directors. I am Nigel Parnell, Manager of Operations. The Senor and Madame tend to do more observing than conversing, so I will be conducting the interview.\" \" Of course. Your excellent reputations precede you of course. It is my honor completely.\" Paul bowed again to the pair seated opposite him across the large wooden table and took his seat. \" Very well Paul. Your resume does n't contain any of your personal information other than your telephone number. Not a name nor address.\" Mr. Parnell said as he took his seat and opened the folder in front of him. \" Yes, regrettably. My apologies. I am just after arriving over the weekend and I am staying with some dear, dear friends of mine. However, my accommodations are nearly prepared, so my permanent address will be provided forthwith.\" Mr. Parnell furrowed his brow. \" Hmm, I see. Well, let me say Paul, this is a very impressive resume.\" \" Thank you sir.\" Paul said and tilted his head forward, cheeks reddening. \" Let's see. Your studies were completed at the Royal Academy of Arts. Your initial tutelage took place at the Tate Modern. From there you held a position at the Louvre, then on to the Centre Pompidou, the Musee D'Orsay, then to Madrid for the Reina Sofia. Impressive.\" \" I have been blessed.\" Paul replied. \" It would seem so. Then a quick stop at the Istanbul Modern, than back across the pond to, ah, let's see, the Fresno Art Museum?\" \" It was nice to be home.\" \" Hmm. Yes. From there you have some stops at the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, the Toledo Museum of Art, and most recently the ah, let's see, the Mobile Museum of Art in Mobile, Alabama was it?\" \" Yes, that is correct.\" Paul replied, shifting slightly in his seat. Mr. Parnell lowered his glasses and asked, \" Forgive me Paul, but is there any particular reason you have gone from the world's finest galleries to, let's say, galleries of significantly lesser prestige?\" Both Senor Cologne and Madame Solange leaned forward attentively. \" That is certainly a fair question. As you noted, I have been blessed in my opportunities and experiences. I felt it appropriate, nay a sense of duty, to share my knowledge with some of the more modest abodes of art in my country of birth. That also explains the number of galleries I've worked in only the past fifteen years and the trend towards shorter stays at each. I contracted the travel bug I'm afraid. I wanted to experience as much as I could, as quickly as I was able. It is my life's passion to show people, old and young alike, beautiful pieces and engage their every curiosity. Nothing gives me more joy than facing a group of wide eyed and eager grade schoolers, thirsty for knowledge. Wanting, desiring to see more. To see everything.\" Mr. Parnell smiled, \" Yes, your frequent relocation was certainly the topic of my next inquiry. Very well. We usually warrant several personal and professional references, however. Since you have just arrived you can provide them once your settled. Now given your experience, we feel it warrants an offer of employment. We will have you shadow a few Tour Guides who have been here for quite some time in order for you to familiarize yourself here.\" Paul sprung to his feet and humbly bowed. \" Thank you for the opportunity.\" Mr. Parnell rose to match him and extended his hand. As they shook Mr. Parnell asked. \" Very good, welcome to the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art Mr. Paul, ah, what was it again?\" \" Paul quickly retracted his hand and covered his mouth. \" Flishehr\" He mumbled. \" I'm sorry, Fisher is it?\" Paul lowered his head, chin to chest. \" Flasher sir. Paul Public-Flasher.\" Madame Solange gasped, \" Oh my!\" Senor Cologne pounded the table with his fist. \" What is this!? A joke?!\" Paul, without raising his head, slowly shook his head back and forth.

The whispers had crossed the oceans, born by winds and currents, until they grew thick in the streets of Spain. For every whisper that immigrated here, another one of us left our home, following its scent like hounds to the jungles of the Americas. Few survived the voyage, many perishing from sickness and malnourishment even as dreams still lit their eyes. Fewer survived the wars, clinging desperately to the hope of treasure where there was none. None survived the century. Except one. Me. I alone found the Aztec secrets and discovered their adherence to human sacrifices. I found their sacred ground, studied their ceremonies, met their gods. And as their culture fell, I killed their thousand year old priest, and stole his last ten years. With my knowledge I was destined to live forever. I have loved many, and I have killed more, savoring the taste of their souls like a sommelier his wine. But as time untwined, I grew weary of their flavors, and sought something more. I had met the gods and basked in their brilliance- now I yearned to join them. And so I, the mortal to live forever, held the gun to my heart. The pistol was cocked, its hammer ready, and the bullet poised as my fingers brushed against the trigger. After five hundred years, it was time. When the bullet ripped into my chest I heard the screams of a hundred trapped souls escape. They were the ones I had killed, the mothers, fathers, and children, whose mangled spirits were freed upon my death. But I did not falter or fall. As the bullet claimed my heart, I knew my mistake. I was the mortal destined to live forever. By killing myself I stole my years. I stole eternal life. And as the millennia passed, and mankind fell, and the sun burned out, and ice claimed the earth, I heard the souls that I had murdered laugh among the gods. *** -Leonard Petracci Author of [ The Luciene Twins ] ( http: //www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00JVVK6VW? pc_redir=1403341728 & robot_redir=1 ), a kindle horror story", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Up ahead the big barn looms in the fire's light. The soft glow of the festivities cast shadows upon the field. The wind circles it, concentrating on the King. For tonight, he truly is the King. I creep closer and see the others going in and coming out. Their voices sing praises to the Pumpkin King. A clatter of commotion drifts past. I hear the laughter and the cheers. I want to scream. I want to kill them all. I reach the barn and everything stops. The others look at me with faces of guilt. The candle light grows in the stillness and I stare at him. He dances with his wife, the Queen of Autumn, the Queen of All. I stare until he turns and looks at me with those cold eyes that burn absolute. He towers over everything and tonight he is taller. He is truly the King. But everything inside of me resists. I can not take it anymore. The blood dries on the dead bone of my fingers and I think I do cry. I cry tearless tears for what is missing. For what he stole. \" Pumpkin! \" I scream. \" Where is it? Where have you put it? What have you done with my heart? \" And there is silence before he speaks. And he doesn't really speak. He laughs his aristocratic laugh and his wife joins him. They all join him in that barn.

The last of your humanity is mines! And oh how it tasted! \" His tongue searched like a serpent, touching all corners of his mouth. His wife cackled and the others pointed.

Her skin was darker with shadowy hair cascading to her chest. While their beauty was unmatchable, their skin seeming to glow, they both wore white plain shifts on their bodies. \" I don't know you two, \" I levelly stated, turning my head around to stare at the room, trying to understand where I was. Strangely, I wasn't worried. The woman gave a tinkling laugh. \" You do. \" \" Just not as well as we know you. \" The man added. There wasn't a door, I realized. I was in a perfect, white cube. Not even shadows spoiled the room. The only item in the room was a small wooden table before us. Something twitched inside of my body. \" How did I get here? \" My voice was higher than normal. What was wrong with me? The woman hushed me. \" Don't fight it, child. Everything is well. \" \" Don't fight what? \" I gasped. I stood from the chair below me, not realizing it was there until this second. My breaths came out lighter and faster. \" What's wrong with me? \" \" Fear, \" The woman spoke softly, easing me back within my chair. That one simple word from her lips brought calmness back inside of me. I was left feeling like I was floating on air. \" Don't fight us, Jane, and everything is okay. \" \" I was feeling fear, \" I responded, amazed that I forgot that emotion. Both the man and woman smiled. \" Where am I? \" \" Nowhere yet, \" The man replied, gesturing around us. \" This is where you go when you have to decide. \" A short, cracked laugh erupted from my lips. \" Isn't that a thing for some god chooses for me? \" The two people before me glanced at each other while the woman shrugged. \" Just one god, \" The man remarked amicably and then gave a smile. He winked at the dark haired woman. \" And even then, they don't really make the choice. The person always has the right. They just don't always make it in their life. \" \" If I'm one of those people… I'm dead, aren't I? \" The woman turned her downcast eyes to the floor, not answering the question but in doing so, giving me my answer. \" Oh. \" I should have felt something stir inside of me but all I felt was a vague disappointment. \" \" So, we'll let you choose now, \" The woman shrugged, her dark hair slipping over her shoulder. \" Can I go with God? \" The naïve words blurted from my chapped lips before I stopped them. The fairer skin man laughed deeply before slowing down to a stop. \" Of course you can go with God. But you could also go with Satan. \" He pushed his hand through his short, brown hair. My head swiveled back and forth from the beautiful couple, trying to decipher his words. \" Okay, I'll go with God. \" \" But who is God? \" They questioned simultaneously. \" Oh, fuck. \" The dark woman giggled at my words. Now, I was getting the point of this meeting. I could choose but I wouldn't know what I was choosing. \" How do I even decide then? If I don't even know what I'm choosing. \" \" You do know what you're choosing, Jane. \" The man reminded. \" You've read bits of the bible. \" I rejected the bible. \" You've heard stories about both of us, \" The man claimed, as if reading my mind. \" Ask us anything and we'll tell you the truth. Know us more and then decide. \" I bit my lower lip, a practice that I once picked up from my older brother. \" Well, who is God? \" \" God is the creator of everything, \" The man answered with ease. Shouldn't God be more humble? Could this really be God? \" God is the reason for consciousness, \" The woman retorted. She smiled to the man, lowering her lashes slightly. I was stumped. \" Fine. Which one of you is God? \" \" The one who created everything. \" \" The one who created consciousness. \" The woman turned to the man, gesturing to the table. \" This might take a while. Perhaps we should take a seat? \" The man nodded and both strolled to the table. Two wooden chairs materialized as the man pulled out a seat for the woman. Genially, she took a seat while the man took one next to her. \" How can I choose when I don't know? \" \" You'll learn, \" The woman promised. I sat there for what felt like a few minutes, trying to think of questions or subjects I could talk to them about before one came to mind. \" I don't believe in God, \" I accused the both of them. \" How can I deserve God if the bible says I don't? \" The man sighed, looking to the ground and shaking his head as if I asked something wrong. The woman placed a hand on his forehead before staring at me with black eyes. \" Jane. Who wrote the bible? \" \" I'm not sure. I think many men wrote it. \" \" That's right. Men wrote it. Do humans always get everything right? \" I blushed a little, my face becoming warm. \" Of course not. It's not their fault. But God would never blame you for not believing in him or her. God loves you. \" \" Do you love me? \" I asked her pointedly. \" Of course I do, \" She countered, tears blinking in the corners of her eyes, as if hurt by my statement. \" Do you love me? \" I inquired from the handsome man before me. He crinkled his eyes in amusement. \" I always have. \" He promised. I felt overwhelmed with their love and promises. How could I choose either of them when I barely knew them? I glanced down at my pale hands, both clasped in the other. I placed them flat on the table before me. Looking at them both, I spoke quietly, \" If I go with you, will I be in pain? \" The man nodded somberly. He couldn't be God. How could God bring you pain? The woman placed her contrasting hand on my own. It was cool. \" You won't be in pain anymore with me. \" I closed my eyes, trying to imagine a life without pain. It was beautiful and awe striking. My heart hurt at the thought. I wanted to choose the woman so badly. I wanted to open my mouth and condemn myself to her, regardless of who was who, if only for the promise of no pain. There was only one thing that left bothering me. I closed my eyes tighter, conjuring a sight before me. A man with tousled light brown hair. Hysterical, happy laughter brought on by conversation with him. Promises of love and life together. Picnics on bright, green grass. I withdrew a shaking hand from the woman, placing one on top of the other. \" I once loved a man. Which of you has him? \" My voice trembled at the question. The woman gave a sad smile. \" I do. \" She took back my hand, bringing to her. \" If you come with me, you can be with him forever. \" A small, content laugh made way through my throat, giddy at the news. My vision went blurry with tears from happiness. \" Do you promise? \" \" I do. \" I held the woman's hand tight in my own. A large hand, smooth and warm, gazed the top of my other hand. The man looked at me worrisome. \" Jane, if you come with me, please know you can still see him. \" I shook my head, soft hair grazing my cheeks. It wasn't enough to just see him. I wanted to be with him. \" If I went with you, could I be with him? \" I asked plainly. The man's eyes darkened. \" No, he chose a different path them me. \" I held the woman's hand tighter, standing up from the table, causing it and the chairs to disappear. \" I'm sorry. My choice is her, \" I informed the man.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I split my time living with Janice and Stephen. They were brother and sister -- that much I knew. But they had their own families, and I was rotated between them based on the time of year. Maybe I'm a slow learner. It took me until my teenage years to put the pieces together. I'm even having a hard time explaining it now. Bear with me. Here goes: Janice and Stephen's mother died quite suddenly. They were in the early twenties when it happened. In a bout of grief, they contacted experts in science, genetics, medicine. Like kids do, they desperately wanted their mother back. And about a year later, they got me instead. I am made up of the same stuff their mother was, but I'm certainly not their mother. They know it too. Some times, I see Janice looking at me, but I can never understand the expression on her face. Regret? Disappointment? Loneliness? Sometimes Stephen will ask me questions. He will sit me down, one-on-one, and he'll ask me questions that his mother would know. When I get them wrong, or when I say that I do n't know, he asks more deliberately and pleads with me to \" really think about it!\" I really try, and I really think about it. He does it less these days. I've seen pictures. I look a lot like their mother. I look exactly like their mother. -- - /r/afakesoundtrack", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Sword Settler was a fun enough game, but dear god, were the revive times long, expecially at my level. I stabbed my thumb at the \" Okay\" button *Would you like to revive instantly with* **50** *Gold Pieces? * Like hell. Fifty GP was about two bucks. SS was fun, but not \" pay two dollars every hour\" fun. I tapped \" No\", and swiped to the Town menu. Death meant that I could n't go on any missions, but there was still town management. Hooray. What fun. Still, I needed every advantage I could get. With more and more people giving in and actually buying GP, I had to be smart with my town to keep from slipping behind. I could recruit workers, appease deities, hire mercs, and, of course, build buildings. And speaking of which... I tapped on the building queue, and sighed. Four hours to completion. Ideally, I'd be able to to activate it as soon as it was finished in order to have an epic sword in time for tomorrow's war, but I also really did n't want to stay up until two in the morning for some shitty game. I was about to close the app when another message popped up. *Would you like to complete construction with* **400** *Gold Pieces? * Rolling my eyes, I tapped \" no\". *Would you like to keep your* **kneecaps** *intact? * My thumb was halfway to the no button before I actually read the message. This was new. Sitting up, I read it again, my finger still hovering over the screen. Maybe it was a typo? Autocorrect from kingdom to kneecaps? That seemed like a stretch. Maybe it was a prank? Of course, it was October, as far from April fools as you could get. It was probably a bug, or some shitty joke one of the programers forgot to take out. If I tapped yes, I'd probably be accidentally buying something. On the other hand, I'd read enough creepypasta and horror to know that I should n't risk it. And it was n't like it could trick me into buying anything without having to type in my password. I tapped \" Yes\". Sure enough, it led me to the microtransaction page. Called it. I closed the shop window, and yet another box popped up. *Are you sure you would like to keep your kneecaps intact? * Alright, this was getting creepy. Hesitantly, I chose \" Yes\" again. This time, it led me straight to a \" deal\". A thousand GP for thirty six bucks. Sitting completely upright in my chair now, I stared at the screen in my hand. I did n't dare close the page, but buying thirty six dollars of virtual shit because my **iPhone** threatened me was crazy. What the hell was I supposed to do? The game answered that for me. I saw a flash at the bottom of the screen, and my revive timer turned red. \" 11:54\" flickered, and became \" 00:15\", then \" 00:14\", then \" 00:13\". With a mumbled \" ohfuckfuckfuckfuck\", I quickly tapped \" buy\", and entered my password. The timer stopped, and another message popped up, making me flinch. \" Thank you for your purchase\" Alright, that was enough Sword Settler for tonight. Buying my building and activating it, I closed the app, and put the phone on my bedside table. Turning off the light, I settled down on my bed. Now that my heart was slowing down, my panicked purchase seemed pretty stupid. I mean, freemium games nowadays would do anything to get people to buy their shitty stuff, even scare them. I'd look it up tomorrow, see if it was a glitch or a feature, and maybe uninstall the game. I'd heard good things about King's Clan, maybe I'd move to that instead. My phone lit up beside me. Picking it up, I saw SS had sent me a notification. *Would you like to keep your* **fingers** *intact? * Behind me, I heard the click of my door locking. Oh shit.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Looking up, or what our navcomps defined on up based on relation to our crusier, i saw two more of the sleek XJ-7 snubfighters escorting a large shuttle into the atmosphere. I turned back to my forward screen as the navcomputer started to sound a collision warning. Pulling up the stick i skimmed over the back of one of the giant whale like creatures who was probably rising to catch the flock of birds that had about flown into me earlier. Looping up and over i did a half loop, stopping while i was still upside down to look at what lay below me. \" Its amazing is n't it?\" Said Mirlen breaking into my flights com channel. a Tucado and our ships chief Surgeon he was the closest thing we had to a real Xeno-biologist until the \" Mimbari\" got here in a few days. \" Its amazing, i do n't know weather to say its more similar to the jungles of my home planet or to the large coral reefs on Philipi.\" He said casuing the rest of the squadron to laugh at the reference to the old joke that the only beaches we ever see are being shot at. \" I want to know who or what made it?\" Said Ranger eight pulling up beside my ship and pacing me as we swopped through the swarms or was it schools of fauna. \" I mean we know there is air here but its just a bubble. There is n't any sort of friction when we enter or leave and there does n't seem to be any machinery inside the place, just klicks and klicks of these creatures.\" Eight was our squadrons science guy, if it came to any piece of tech he could figure it out. He had joined the Navy as a way to pay for college but the love of flying had kept him in the cockpit and out of the laboratory. But what he said got me wondering to. This..area was just a big bubble in space. A big multi kilometer ball of air floating in space. And that was n't the most amazing thing. It had floating rocks and jungles filled with creatures that looked like a mix of bird and fish, the smallest of which was as large as one of the engines on my ship. \" Have n't detected any sort of technology signatures.\" Mirlen said bringing me back to the conversation he was having with Ranger one. \" We are going to try and capture a small plant sample along with one of the smaller creatures and see if there is some sort of biotech at work.\" \" Do you think it will make them angry? What if one of them decides to attack the ship?\" Ranger one said not liking the idea of having to fight off and angry space fish. \" We do n't know. But that's why we are going for one of the creatures that moves in the schools. We figure the prey species will be less likely to attack if confronted.\" \" Why?\" I asked breaking into the argument \" The \" Mimbari\" will be here in three days. We should just wait and see what they want to do.\" \" It was the \" Mimbari\" who sent us the request. They want us to start some studies so they can get started right away.\" Mirlen said sounding a little annoyed at being told what to do by the captain of another ship. My flight spent the next six hours flying around and taking every sensor reading the scanners on our ships could do. It would have been boring if it was n't for the few tense times where we had to chase off one of the smaller predators that mistook the shiny hull of the transport for its favorite meal. Eventually once the transport was full of samples and the space fish was tied to the outside of the transports hull like some kind of whale on an ancient whaling ship we were given the all clear to head home. \" Hey mirlen i just thought of something.\" Ranger eight said as we flew beside the ship. \" This thing is moving right? Do we know where its going, or where its came from?\" It was true, the bubble was moving at a fast rate. It was only because it was so large that we were able to keep up with it like a moon following around a planet. \" I ran it ten times last night.\" Mirlen said \" If its been going in a straight line all this time then it had to originate some where outside the Galaxy.\" \" That cai n't be right\" Ranger one said. She was a spacejockey through and through and even she had taken enough Astro classes to know that you could n't make it past the rim without some special tech. \" It is, at least according to the ten different computers and the nine Gran engineers i had do the calculations.

It would be worth it, she thought, these dumb fuckers wo n't even comprehend what hit them. She was about 30 meters from the intended epicenter. Her fingers went to her utility belt. She flicked on a switch. *vhmp, vhmp, vhmp, vhmp* The switch had activated the vibrator inserted in her. She moved slowly now, calculating that she needed at least 5 minutes before climaxing. She had thought herself a freak of nature when she first realized that she had this ability. Her boyfriend, unfortunately, was the first unintended victim and has yet to recover from his coma. The horror of realizing that she would never again normally experience sexual pleasure was replaced by more horrors as the government got their hands on her. Test after test followed.

There's no time. *vhmp, vhmp, vhmp, vhmp, vhmmmmmmmp, vhmmmmmmmp* She managed to take down the first three guards and made it further before she was ovewhelmed. 10 meters to epicenter. Before they could bind her hands she had set her belt to maximum. *vhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmp vhmmmmmmmmp* These bearded bastards might be wondering why she was smiling while they were twisting her arms. Every slap to her face resulted in a fleeting grimace of pain -- quickly replaced by an unmistakable expression of pleasure. Who sent you? One of them screamed at her. CIA? MI-6? Who sent you? Then another slap. They did n't know she liked it when they played rough. She can feel the tension building inside her, her center growing warm and tingling with the built-up energy of 6 months of denial. HQ calculated that it was enough time to build up the energy to cover a 5 kilometer radius and ensure that nothing is left. She laughed at the face of her captors. They had her kneeling in front of their leader, who was growing increasingly agitated. Who are you? Who sent you? Answer! Answer! She looked up at him. Better give the guy something, she decided. Plus she had to play for time. She was *so* close now. Her words came out in quick rapid gasps. *It does n't matter who sent me, you sand-eating fucker. I've seen what you do, especially to women. I thought I'd been cursed by this thing I can do, that nothing would come out of having this. I hated myself for so long.

For the very thing you despise -- no, the very thing you fear, will destroy you! * And it comes, she arched her back and let out a loud moan. Her body twisted and arched as a wave of orgasm hits her. The air crackled with electricity. The humid air also began to increase in warmth. The ground shook, a slight vibration at first, then it built up into a minor quake which jolted the men. The woman fell writhing to the ground. a shockwave emanated from her center, knocking back the men surrounding her. She let out another moan, and another shockwave emanated from her, this time throwing the men several feet back.

He had figured out what his parents got him for Christmas, like always. It was hard to hide gifts from Terry, he always found out what it was. And he knew he was getting a watch this time. He knew his grandmother will send him chocolates and a sweater. But he did not know what his Secret Santa would send him, and that had taken the sleep away from his eyes. He was very excited when he signed up for it. But now he was going insane with curiosity.He had to know! He could n't wait for the package to come, he had to know right then! To divert his mind, he got up and went to his living room. The tree stood there, glowing and colorful. The presents would be stacked beneath it at dawn, by his father. He always knew it was his father who got the presents and Santa Claus was just a story. As a kid he had many a tussle with his friends when they claimed Santa did exist. The memory made him chuckle. He absently toyed with a shiny blue ornament when the door creaked open. He turned, frightened, thinking someone was breaking into his house. The intruder slowly moved inside and shut the door behind him, gasping for breath. Terry noticed that the robber, keeping up with the Christmas spirit, had shunned his black clothes and masks and had dressed up as Santa instead. Despite himself, he laughed, attracting the attention of the fat, red faced stranger. Santa looked at him and sighed. \" Terry, you should be sleeping. \", he spoke, gently. Terry was nonplussed at the kind voice. Would n't a robber be sticking a gun in his face instead? Terry thought for a while. Then it dawned on him. \" Dad? \", he asked, not entirely sure of himself. Santa laughed,\" Ho Ho Ho! I am not your dad!\". \" Who are you then?\" Santa looked disappointed. He pointed to his beard, his suit and his sack of presents. \" Can you guess? \", he quipped. \" Yeah, anyone can dress in a Santa costume. Now tell me what is this.\" \" I ca n't tell you! You should not be knowing this. It is supposed to be secret! And now you'll know! I was thinking this was anonymous..\" \" No way! You are my Secret Santa?\" \" Aye\" \" And you say you are the Real Santa?\" \" Aye\" \" Why did n't you take the chimney?\" Santa smiled, a little embarassed. \" Well you see the door is more convenient for a man of my... girth\", he explained. \" Where are your reindeer, Santa?\" \" Gods!

And I use reddit as well. I was your Secret Santa, but that ai n't a secret anymore.\" \" If you do exist, Santa, then why does my dad keep my presents for me?\" Santa straightened his back and walked across the room to take a seat on the couch. \" Boy, why do you think your dad gives you the present? Why do you think people give each other presents on Christmas?\" \" Because it is a tradition?\" \" Because *I* tell them to. *I* am the spirit of Christmas, *I* am the love which inspires people to give.I do not go from home to home-Oh wait, but I do! \", he said laughing. \" And what about those who do n't give presents?\" \" I can not force them. I can only encourage them, by touching their hearts\", Santa said with a smile. He ruffled Terry's hair, who was watching him, perplexed. He got up and went to the door. \" Merry Christmas, Terry\", said Santa. \" Wait. Why did you come to me then?\" Santa smiled again. \" I truly wanted to surprise you boy.But you saw me. So I guess I will have to send it in the mail like everyone else!\" Terry ran after him, trying to stop him, \" But Santa!!!!

Two walls and half the floor of my office were missing, collapsed into rubble two floors below. I opened my desk drawer and stuffed a pistol in my back pocket, then picked up the biggest gun from the rack which should have been hidden by a sliding panel, if the wall were still intact. My sense of hearing half returned and I really wish it did n't, because now my head was full of sirens and the cackling laughter of Dr Justice and his slow, almost diplomatic speech: \" Behold! You are in pieces by my hand! I have proved the superiority of technology! No longer shall ordinary people be at the mercy of men and women like you!\" Dr Justice pointed a mechanical glove at MissTerious, our best psychic, and clenched his fist. The phrase \" pop like a melon\" comes to mind. Her kneeling body fell to the ground, yet more blood splattering Dr Justice and the rest of the heroes, my friends, all lined up and kneeling on the ground. \" Where are you, Smith? Have I goten a rise out of you yet?\" \" You fucking bet, you son of a bitch!\" I called out from behind my desk. Well, that was a mistake obviously, but MissTerious was my closest super-friend and only confidant, and smoking hot, so I was pissed. I was lifted out from behind the desk and pulled down onto the floor of the Hall of Heroes; with no gracious thought for my motion sickness, and forced to my knees by invisible forces which were no doubt the product of Dr Justice's misguided genius. My gun was wrenched from my hands and with it any sense of hope. \" Now, you will watch your family _burn, _ as I did mine.\" Pyrobloke, next in line, contorted his face into a mixture of disgust and pain. He screamed, and began to vomit while screaming so that a horrible choking interrupted the noise. Pyrobloke had an incredibly high pain tolerance, and a very solid cap on his powers for someone with such a volatile gift. However, he erupted in flames all the same, charging orange then blue from his wrists and neck. His face and hands melted, and his body slumped to the floor. Dr Justice apparently held him in a forcefield heat-bubble because none of the other supers were effected, but once he released it the smell of burnt flesh unmistakably filled the entire hall. I could n't help my motion sickness and the foul smell made me vomit on the floor, too. The others followed suit. \" How does it _feel, _ Smith? Perhaps anger will spark your proof of office.\" Elasto-blast was lifted from the ground and struggled, as if being choked, and Dr Justice pulled him out into a superthin coil and wrapped it around itself. Elasto-blast continued screaming as he was twisted like a balloon animal into a roughly humanoid form, stretched far beyond what his powers normally allowed. His screams burned into my brain and I began to weep, certain this was the end. Elasto-blast dropped to the ground in a puddle. \" Stop it! _Stop it! _ You've made your point! Let them _go! \" _ \" I can not do that, Smith, and you know why. You must be wiped _out. \" _ Dr Justice twisted a dial on his glove and the remaining super-heroes screamed, vomited blood, and collapsed in a heap of convulsing limbs. The sight made me want to wretch. \" Will you show me now, before your end, and die fighting honourably?\" \" I'll fucking kill you with my hands, powers or not!\" Dr Justice put his non-mechanised hand to his chin and stroked it: \" Your survival... can mean only the strongest of healing powers. You were wise to hide them from me. Now, your failure is complete.\" Dr Justice released his forcefield grip on me, and I collapsed to the ground. He set the mechanised glove and pointed it to me. \" I will cook any remnant of your curse from you.\" I braced for a horrible death but instead only felt slightly warm. Now I could feel my limbs again. I patted my back pockets and found the gun. Quicker than I knew how, I pointed at the proud figure and shot once. The silence deafened me, and I crawled towards his body. His shocked eyes stared at the ceiling as he began choking on blood. \" Sm-... how..?\" Without a word, I pointed the gun at his head and shot once more.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It awkwardly restricts the story description and narrows the scene to one dead perspective, which, of course, can be useful. But I am bad at it. *** The door closed with a soft click. I could still see the shadow of Daddy's feet under the door. I think he had a rough day because I saw him drinking the fizzy bitter apple juice today, but he still put me to bed personally. I saw the feet started to walk away. Tock tock tock... Daddy is gone. I quickly pulled my covers up to my cheeks. I turned my eyes and peeked at the blackness above my closet. *It* always hides there. But now it was quiet. Perhaps Daddy is right this time. There are no monsters, they are just my inagination. I slowly relaxed my grip on my blankets and let out a slow sigh of relief. Suddenly the closet creaked. I felt the hair on my neck stand up. I turned to look again. Nothing. Sometimes there are two yellow eyes; sometimes you just ca n't see it. It can hide really well. I could kind of feel it staring at me right now. It made me really scared. I wanted to pull my blankets up to cover my eyes, but the last time I did that, it came over to my bed, crouched beside me and tugged at my leg. At first it would just eerily make weird noises around the room. I think it ataryed to realise I was too frightened to react. It then started to do more naughty things. Bad things like pushing my pink alarm clock to the ground or throwing my books around on the floor. In the morning, Mommy would become really angry and scold me for the naughty things I did n't do. When I tried to explain what happened, Mommy would call for Daddy to bring to cane, because I am a \" liar\". Daddy always refused. He would say something about me being young and then pull Mommy out of my room far away. I like Daddy. I hate Mommy. She never ever trusts and and always get angry when I say the bruises on my body are caused by _it_ throwing objects at me during the night. Although I think Daddy does not really believe it, but he would just sternly tell me to \" not do it again\". I like Daddy. Even when the monster is bullying me, I never ever cry, because I know Daddy loves me and will protect me. I felt a firm tug on my blanket. Was n't it on top of my closet a second ago? Suddenly, the blanket tore out of my grip and flew across the room. Scared stiff, I could n't move at all. The monster was right in front of me- close up. I have never seen it this close before. It had terrible eyes and terrible claws and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws. Except this time, it was n't yellow. It was blood-red. I almost cried when the monster suddenly pinned me against my bed and grabbed me by my neck- but I must be brave, because Daddy said this is all just imagination. I could n't move my head, but I could already feel the claws sinking into my arms. The sharp pain did n't feel like inagination. Daddy, I think you are wrong. It's not my imagination. Monsters are real, Daddy... DADDY!!! Books, clock, table and chairs flung in a mess and crashed into one another. All I could see is chaos. *** The door slammed open. Mommy comes in. \"\" What the fuck?!\" -her face turns furious as she notices my bleeding arms- \" Nathan!! She's fucking crazy! What the fuck is wrong with you?!\" I am scared. I hug my torn pillow tight until I smelt fizzy bitter apple juice. Daddy stumbles in. He is going to save me from the flailing woman. He is going to pull her out of my room. \" Enough of this shit!\" Daddy shouted as he reaches for his belt this time. He folds it in half. I have never seen him this angry. He stomps towards me.

Children ran gleefully in the semi-dark, occasionally tumbling off a bamboo walkway with a splash. Teenagers swam through copses of tall green tendrils, away from the prying eyes of their mothers. Elders sat on porches, staring out at the horizon, rocking slowly back and forth as they whittled their spears. The wind was picking up, as it did every night, and it carried the sounds of the massive machines on the horizon. Elder Mak squinted his large gray eyes at the horizon. He pulled a retractable telescope from his satchel of relics. The machines had gotten closer. He could see their metallic gleam. He stuck two fingers in his mouth and whistled. The young people let out a collective groan, swimming back to the boardwalk and climbing out of the water. Children's feet slapped against the walkway, making it bounce. Everyone flocked to the central shelter, built of stone in the center of town. One by one, the Elders stopped by Elder Mak's porch to hand him their spears. They stared into his gray eyes, reflecting on the challenges he had seen, the triumphs, the loss, the joy. They owed him their lives—when the machines had come for them, he had sheltered them on his barge. He had brought them far from civilization, out of the range of the machine's fuel cells. For decades, they had prospered in peace. An old woman with long gray hair and a kind smile touched Elder Mak on the shoulder. \" May you die tonight with glory, \" she said. Another woman, brow furrowed with wrinkles kneeled down to grab his hand. \" May you die tonight with glory, \" she said. One by one, the rest of the elders kneeled before him and wished him a glorious death. Elder Mak bowed his head in thanks. They slowly filed away towards the stone shelter, leaving him alone on his high observatory tower. He counted his spears and peered once more through the telescope. \" Wait! \" he called. Only one woman heard him. She stopped and turned as the others kept walking. \" Elder Yoon, \" Mak said. She came closer. Mak compacted his telescope and placed it in the satchel of relics. He pressed the satchel into Elder Yoon's hand. \" I am sorry, \" Mak said. \" Me? \" Yoon asked, \" But why am I next? I am not the eldest. \" Mak sighed. \" You have had a long life, \" he said. \" I'd like a longer one, \" Yoon said. \" And I wouldn't? \" Mak said, angrily. \" I haven't much time left, and I don't want to waste it on you. \" \" There are rules, \" Yoon said, \" You should know. You made them. \" \" The Gods made them, \" Mak said, \" I am merely their conduit. \" The wind grew stronger. \" Elder Fan is next in line, \" Yoon said. She paused. \" Or did you forget the age of your eldest *wife*? \" \" The Gods— \" Mak began. \" The Gods aren't real, \" Yoon shouted. \" You made them up because you can't face the truth. I may not be as old as Elder Fan, but I'm old enough to remember the day you destroyed the radios. \" \" The machines were listening to us! \" Mak said. \" Those were *humans* talking to us, \" Yoon said. The machines grew larger on the horizon. \" There were shelters—underground shelters that we could have gone to, \" Yoon said. \" Real shelters, with doctors, schools, and electricity, \" her voice broke. \" Electricity is heresy! \" Mak said, \" The Gods will punish— \" Yoon grabbed a spear and pointed it at him. \" You kidnapped us, \" she said, \" We thought you were rescuing us, but you kidnapped us. \" \" You were a child, \" Mak snarled, \" How would you know? \" \" I remember, \" Yoon said, the spear shaking in her hands. \" And you kept silent all this time? \" Mak said. \" Who would have believed me? \" Yoon said, \" By the time I was grown, I was your wife. Just like everyone else on that ship. \" She shoved the spear into his chest. He looked down and stared. Was she right? Had he invented the Gods? No, surely not. The Gods demanded a sacrifice every night. It was how they had lived for years. Decades. Yoon had gone soft in the head. All of the Elders had gone crazy. That was why the Gods wanted them sacrificed. That was the order of the universe. He collapsed to the deck of his tower, clutching at the spear in his chest. He looked up at the machines as their shadows passed in front of the moon. Yoon's footfalls echoed in the distance. The machines descended towards him, their engines roaring with the fury of the Gods. \" At last, \" he breathed, staring into the mechanical eye of a marauding deathdrone, \" I look upon the face of my maker. \" The deathdrone shot a red gout of flame across the black sky, to purify Mak's soul. -- -- - Thanks for reading! /r/trrh", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

She worked 25 hours a week at a local grocer, bagging and stocking shelves coupled with her studies at university. She did n't appear to be any more empathic or kindhearted than anyone else I've met, but I witnessed something that changed my opinion on her forever. \" Hey Janet!\" I called from the kitchen. \" If I cook tonight, do you want chicken or lamb?\" I'm a qualified chef so any opportunity to cook in my own kitchen I do n't pass up. \" Janet!\" I called again, a bit louder than before. no response. I walked down the hallway and knocked on her door to which there was no response. I called her name from the other side of her door and waited for a response. still no response. I closed my hand around the handle of her door and turned it, just to pop my head in and see if she WAS in there but had headphones on or something. She did in fact have her headphones on, but she also had something else on her that left the image burned into my brain. \" Janet...\" I said quietly, and she saw me in the reflection of her mirror which was propped against the wall opposite her door. Her face contorted in panic and fear as she threw her headphones off and covered her exposed breasts. \" PHILLIP!!\" She screamed as her bold beautiful wings retracted and folded neatly on her back. \" what the fuck Janet? You've... you've got wings?! what-\" Before I could finish my question, I felt a heat pass over my body and I collapsed where i was standing, only to come to on the couch in the living room. I jerked awake and sat upright to notice Janet sitting in the recliner opposite me. \" Phil, I'm so sorry you saw that, but please just let me explain\" \" Explain?!\" I spurted out, almost out of breath again. \" WHAT are you??\" \" Please Phil, do n't think ill of me. You were never supposed to see me like that.\" \" What, naked?\" I asked with a quizzical look on my face. \" No, in my true form. I've had to hide it since i was a child, and I really thought my own room would be a private enough place to, you know, let them out.\" \" True form?? What!?\" \" Phillip, I'm an angel.\" There was a pause in our conversation that almost seemed like hours long.

She had thought maybe she'd imagined it, but decided to run to the next room and turn up the television anyways. And there he was on the news, her long gone husband and best friend being hauled out of one of those ungodly large tanks he had left in so long ago. The banner running across the bottom of the screen simply read \" Last Remaining Member of the 7th Expedition Found Alive.\" *2 Hours Later* Tears swelled in her eyes as she held Mark's hand for the first time since the morning he had left on his expedition. He looked much older now, his skin was pale and rough. A grizzled blonde beard now covered his face. Two scars now decorated one of his cheeks. His eyes faintly opened and they made eye contact for the first time. \" Hey you\" was all he could muster up. He smirked a little before passing out. A tear had rolled down his scarred cheek. Kendall broke down in tears of joy before the medical staff escorted her out of the room to prep for surgery. *10 Hours Later* Kendall had been kept in a small room in the hospital, away from any news cameras that had now surrounded the entire building. Several men in suits had come in and out throughout the night to console her and congratulate her on her husband's return. One of them was Wallace Quincy, president of the Border Exploration Agency and Mark's best friend. The last time Kendall had seen him was at Mark's funeral where she had slapped him across the face for sending him and his team out into the Borderlands. This time though she simply hugged him. \" How is he?\" she asked him. \" Unfortunately I only know about as much as you do right now. They should be finished with the surgery by now though, so we'll know soon.\" He looked saddened to see her. Kendall could tell that the loss of Mark had resonated greatly on Wallace over the years. \" I just want you to know that I am still so sorry for putting you through all of this..\" Kendall shushed him and put a hand gently over his mouth. \" He's back now, that's all that matters, Wally\" she said with a smile. Kendall could see his face flush with relief. It was the first time Wallace had felt good about something in a very long time. A tall, frail man in a lab coat entered the room. \" He can see you now.\" *The Next Day* Kendall stood next to Mark's bed as the room filled with several important looking men and women. Most went up to Mark to shake his hand and tell him how glad they were to see him alive. Wallace came up to her after shaking some other man's hand across the room. He smiled at both of them and put his hand on Mark's shoulder. Mark put his hand on Wallace's and smiled back at him. \" We're going to start the debrief now. Kendall, it may be tough to hear what happened, if you'd like to step out for a li..\" she abruptly cut him off. \" I'm staying\" she said sternly. Wallace nodded and turned to address the others in the room to tell them that the debriefing was about to begin. Mark grabbed Kendall's hand gently and pulled her close to him. She leaned in, his voice was still faint and tired. \" I saw it.\" he said to her and smirked the way he always had when he was about to tell her something important. \" Saw what?\" Kendall thought to herself. Wallace spoke up before she could ask Mark what he meant. \" Okay Mark, whenever you're ready, let's begin.\" Wallace said calmly. He was n't sure he was ready to hear what the last remaining survivor of a 30 man crew he had commissioned himself had to say. Mark, still looking at Kendall, turned to face the small crowd. He leaned up slowly in his bed. \" I'm going to have to start from the beginning for this all to make sense\" he said. And so he began telling his tale that was now three years in the making. *3 Years Ago* \" The whole worlds going to be watching you know.\" Wallace said with a smile. Mark Osbourne raised his beer bottle with a smile. \" Lets hope we do n't disappoint them then, huh?\" Wallace raised his and clanked it against Mark's. \" I wish I could head out there with you guys, you know that right?\" Wallace had been studying the Borderlands for most of his adult life. A barren wasteland stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction that no man had gone more than 50 miles into. Winds that could uproot a redwood blew in every direction towards Singularis, the last major city on this godforsaken planet. Probes had been sent before, but their tracking devices began failing some 75-100 miles out. High winds in the jet stream prevented any type of probe to be sent into space as well. They were trapped here, more or less, Wallace would think to himself, and no one really seemed to ever care enough to figure out how or why. \" I know you do buddy, I know. But these people would be lost if you left. And who would watch Kendall for me while I'm gone if you were out there with me?\" Wallace shrugged, Mark was right. Besides, the lab was his home. Wallace never was one for field work and a mission of this type suited the explorers like Mark much more. The two sat in silence for several minutes, both thinking the same thing. Mark finally broke the silence. \" So, what do you think we're going to find out there?\" he asked. Wallace honestly did n't have an answer. *Expedition Day One* Several miles into the Borderlands, Mark glanced at a screen showing the rear of one of the expedition's three monolithic tanks. The skyline of Singularis faded into the distance. \" That was a pretty girl you had there\" a burly man sitting next to Mark exclaimed. Harold Sanders, the chief engineer of the tanks they were currently riding in, was 6'3\" when standing. His voiced was booming and echoed across the titanium hull of the tank. A great, silver beard adorned his face. His hair was slicked back down to his shoulders. He looked like one of the toughest sons of bitches Mark had ever seen. Mark nodded in agreement. \" That she is, going to miss that girl.\" The expedition was slated for two years. One out and one to come back. Mark knew it was n't going to be easy for her to have him gone for so long, but Wallace was going to keep an eye on her, and knowing she was going to be there waiting when Mark finally came back was all the motivation he needed to complete this mission. \" Harold Sanders, right?\" Mark extended a hand out. \" Aye, but my friends just call me Harry.\" He grabbed Mark's hand with a powerful grip and smirked. Mark refocused on the screens in front of him. The convoy moved slowly across the desert, and the winds had already begun to pick up and rattled the outside of the tank. Mark grabbed the radio. \" Prospect 2, this is Prospect 1. Do you copy?\" he announced into the mic. There were a few seconds of static before the other end responded. \" Prospect 1, this is Prospect 2. We hear ya loud and clear over here. Might wan na check on 3 though, looks like she's slacking a bit back there\" replied Prospect 2's captain. Marcus Whitewater, had a southern twang to his voice and almost never shut up, but the man knew what he was doing and Mark was glad to have him on the expedition. \" Fuck off, Whitewater. Maybe if you knew how to drive one of these my crew would n't be stuck behind you guys\" a cheery voice answered back on the radio. Captain Sadie Richards of Prospect 3. Mark chuckled thinking of how such a small girl could have such a big mouth. She could probably beat up Mark too though, so he'd keep that thought to himself. \" Ooh, you kiss your mother with that mouth, Cap?\" Whitewater answered back. \" Alright guys, lets keep it in check\" Mark intervened. \" Prospect 2, Prospect 3, all systems ready to go?\" \" Aye, Captain\" both responded simultaneously. \" Lets push it then.\" Mark put the radio back down and looked over to Sanders and nodded. Sanders took the cue and pushed the tanks throttle forward. The engines purred loudly and the tank accelerated forward into the unknown. *I'm going to finish the rest of this over the weekend, hopefully it's not too long by then but we'll see!

When she rests her fingertips on it, her palm ends up over her heart like she's reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. And she does touch it often. When she's touching it she can access the reserve of dreams inside her. Nightmares, caught like flies in the inked web. Or, more often, taken actively upon request. She's peeled away recurring brutal rape like she peeled the dreamer's desperate grip off her ( Please. I heard you could help me. Please, I'm begging you, please- ), kissed her lover's forehead to still their fitful sleep, comforted her little nephew that she could lead away the monster under his bed. The dreamcatcher tattoo is the gate into which these nightmares flow, and they can flow out the same way. Like silk scarves from a magician's sleeve, she can pull them out and tie them around her own eyes. The drug education she had in school tended to dramatize. Taste one drop of alcohol and drop out of school. Cigarettes will drag potential for greatness out of you. Leah doubts it. But that's the kind of language she uses to describe her experiences in other people's nightmares. Touch the patch of ink just once, and the whole world falls away. It's three in the morning and Leah can't sleep. Any kind of dream is better than wakefulness, she supposes. She pulls aside the left shoulder strap of her tank top. She's standing in the shadow of a big house. It feels like a special occasion. Thanksgiving? But she's alone. This isn't one of the dreams she took by request, which means the dreamcatcher caught it purely by chance, after it had been forgotten and set adrift. Leah never experiences dreams as herself. Only the original dreamer fits into their own nightmare world. She gradually becomes aware of whose vision she's borrowing. Short. Athletic. Dressed in a faded red hoodie and torn-up jeans. A boy, maybe twelve. Inarticulate in life. That's why there are no words to accompany the view. The house backs up to a steep hill. The unkempt night-black grass is too slippery from rainwater to navigate safely, but she goes down it anyway, sneakers sliding. A hulking pine tree grows at the bottom where the lawn flattens out again. It's glowing even brighter than the few lit windows of the house behind her. It's covered in jack-o-lanterns. Big fat ones, curved shells as orange as the flames within. They seem too heavy for the branches they rest on, and they might not be resting on the branches at all, instead floating unsupported in a strange curtain. Moths giving light instead of the flame. The faces of the jack-o-lanterns are vaguely creepy, big empty grins, but her strongest instinct is to climb. She comes close enough to touch the trunk, closer in than the layer of pumpkins. Now when she looks up she can't see the top of the tree at all. It might go up forever, Jack's glowing beanstalk bringing her up to the land of the giants. She pulls herself up onto the lowest branch, careful to avoid touching the pumpkin grinning at her. The house draws her attention again. A back door had opened, spilling light onto the lawn. A woman stands in the frame. She calls the dreamer's name. \" Come inside! It's dark out. \" No kidding. No kidding it's dark out. But this is a mother's command that can be safely ignored.

It was picturesque before they added the observatory, but with the traditional Roumelian architecture framing the peak it's almost ridiculous. I was tempted to ask Saira how they'd avoided ending up with a modernist airline terminal, but something else was of more immediate importance. \" They wo n't attack, will they?\" \" They never have yet,\" she replied. By then, seven days into the trip, I was getting used to the slightly threatening overtones of Roumelian humour. \" If you're worried, hold your hat up on a stick,\" my Scottish photographer growled. \" It works with terns, so I'm told.\" Saira did n't seem to appreciate having her national beast compared with an over-aggressive gull. She swung her bag over her shoulder and strode across the grass. \" How did the tree grow up there in the first place?\" I asked. \" There are two stories. A holy man lived on the mountain in the wars. He might have grown it. Or it might have been the Khedive, showing he could do what he wanted even on the hardest mountain in Roumelia.\" When the scientific community were forced to concede that dragons *did* exist and could be seen by those with enough stamina to withstand the hazards of mountain roads and bad wine, Roumelia became a centre of attraction for cryptozoologists. Now the other legends had been tried and found wanting, eco-tourism had moved in. As yet no new hotels have spoiled the picturesque town, and despite my fifty-year-old bed and the packed lunch that seemed not much younger I felt glad of that. In a couple of weeks the dragons would lay their eggs and the tourists would come flocking in. Saira seemed fairly sanguine about having twenty people a day around her equipment. Did n't she worry about what might happen? \" No. We check the lists carefully. No rowdies get in here, no thieves. All good people.\" \" How about egg-collectors? Surely a dragon's egg would be immensely valuable.\" \" Not more than the $ 50,000 the government gives the oological societies every year. If an egg goes missing - *fwit*!\" She whisked the pamphlet from between my fingers. \" But do they respect their societies enough?\" \" Mostly. It is their world, their whole life to be in these societies. The man who took the first egg would be vilified, thrown out of everything. There is only one who will come. One who is already thrown out, who has nothing to lose.\" She gestured out through the open side of the platform, at the mountain with its peaks like the spines on the backs of the dragons painted on the walls, across to the diagonal projections that somehow supported the tree, and finally to the second brass tube pointing at the mountain. \" He will not climb the south side. There are too many overhangs.

Sure there are plenty of old mirror houses in most abandoned theme parks, but this one is different. This park,\"The Great Amazo's Carnival of Curiosities and Pleasantries.\" had something of a history, especially with the mirror house. Many children had disappeared and even more adults had been driven odd and strange by their experiences inside the fair. But the house of mirrors was especially strange. A maze of strange mirrors made out of an unknown form of glass, many had gone in there to see themselves in funny manners. Many left with new terrifying perspectives on who they were or what they could be. Some say that a mirror shows us a gateway to another world, where everything is slightly different. Usually romanticist nonsense and pointless old-wives tales. Unless for once there might be a grain of truth in those words. The mirrors, which according to mister Amazo was given to him by a warlock from far off Cathay, if you asked him in the day. He was quoted as\"*He told me that those mirrors contain endless forms most beautiful and pleasing to the pure and good. *\" Whether he was aware of what was inside of it, no-one knows. Only thing we know is that one day, in 1914, somewhere in Virginia, the fair finally ended, was abandoned by its operators and left to rot. The mirrors of this maze can acts as windows, and some as gates. When you go through the mirrors that acts as gates or old gods forbid that you open a window, you become your alternate self. It is a strange experience, temporarily taking the place of your other you in that world, or permanently if you do not run through the mirror again screaming. How can this happen you ask? It is because that while the mirror house was always a weak point in the fabric of the multiverses, where it was abandoned was where escaped witches of Salem and native shamans from the Shawnee and Cherokee tribes met to make an alliance to get vengeance on the colonists for being a bunch of assholes. They wove a spell best forgotten, to make the land of the colonists so strong that their pride would destroy them from within, however making magic where the gate between the profane world and the realm of magick and might, originally for added juice to the spell, caused it to go into overdrive. That is a whole other story that ends tragically somewhere in the twentififth century, but the spell did not only further weaken the wall between universes, it made cracks. Tiny cracks, big enough for something to get in or out, quite useful for something that needed a getaway. Unfortunately for our increasingly mundane universe, which had a strange and unexplainable decrease in the powers of old magick, caused a bleeding effect. Magic from our universe, which frankly was nearly spent already, begun leaving through the cracks, and though there was many different worlds in the mirrors, only a few led to the correct cracks. If a crack corresponded with an alternate world, you could move through it. Let me tell you a tale, of a boy that moved through the gateway. Timothy, a boy seven years old from a small town was dared or pressured to enter the mirror house by his big bully of an elder brother. When inside he leaned on a mirror and started to cry, he cried so hard that he did n't notice that he fell through the mirror into another world. And fortunately for him he fell into a nice one, unlike the one where the orphan Alice fell through, that led to a universe where everyone was okay with eating orphans and other unwanted people to keep the population levels low. She ended feeding a nice family of four, but I digress. Timothy, or Tim as most called him, fell through the mirror and found that he had changed shape. The main creatures that had evolved in that universe were not a form of hairless apes, but rather a branch of raptors that had made civilization. Quite interesting was that the bleeding effect of magical power was only in effect when the portal was open, and something passed through. Little Tim was saturated in arcane energies. And as he ran out of the mirror maze, scared shitless, he had the power of a minor deity, not world-ending but certainly destructive if in panic. However besides the fact that everyone, including the body that the previously human Tim now resided in were lizards, there were many other fundamental differences between their universe and ours. First and foremost, magic still worked flawlessly in their reality, and Tim's brother was a much better bloke than before. Tim decided to stay in that universe, since his brother on our side was that much of a dick. Of course that meant the eventual erasure of the original lizardworld Tim's mind, but little Tim did n't know that. Because he was seven. He later used the extra magic juice he got from moving through realities to gain a PH.d in arcanology. He fathered seven eggs, a whooping five of which hatched and reached maturity. Another traveller was the college student Rob. Rob had been studying fairs for his paper on American entertainment history, mind you he was n't a very good student, he spent most of his time playing Dungeons and Dragons with his friends or playing various games online while complaining that they did n't feel like Morrowind. A fairly standard bloke. He came to explorer the fair because he had heard that field research gave better grades, of course he was n't sure what field research meant so he just brought a camera and his phone. He went into the mirror house, and touched a mirror, the coincidentally led to where Tim had gone, surprised at the strangeness of his hand disappearing, he tested another mirror, and went through it. On the other side there was a great deal of commotion: He had appeared in the middle of a demon summoning, that a bunch of adorable cutebolds had been making. They then charged him with the protection of their tribe. Rob had no idea what to make of that, but decided to go along with it anyway. He tried his hand with a sword, which he was actually fairly decent with from his LARP days, the bow which was a disaster and he had to give his camera to a very disgruntled cutebold, who had lost his goat and finally he attempted magic, which had quite the surprising effect. Eventually what the cutebolds had described as an invading force came, and to his surprise he had to fight off a bunch of gnome-like creatures who were armed to the teeth. He slew them all by accidentally releasing a hidden trap that everyone had forgotten about that pulled away the floor under the gnomes and killed them in a badly made spikefall trap. He was still celebrated as a hero, and he also decided to never return to our world again, as this was where he felt he belonged. Many others had gone into the mirrors, some found their calling others their worst nightmares. Some found love, other found fortune and yet others fled in terror. Are you brave or do you need a new place? Do you not fear death? Do you wish for a great adventure in a world unlike anything you know? Then find the the fair, find the mirror house and choose a mirror, if you do n't like what you find then you can always return and pick again. The cracks and the mirrors will be waiting for you.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "A transport space shuttle carrying thousands has an emergency crash landing on planet similar to earth. Less than 500 survive, only 6 of whom are crew. 3 maintenance men, a cook, and 3 low ranked guards. No one finds them. What does this unintentional settlement become 100 years later?", "output": "'Where d'you think you're going?'said the guard, angling his lightstaff to block my way.'Lay off, Reggie,'I said, raising my visor.'It's just me.'The guard raised his own visor, revealing his battle-scarred face. He peered at me more closely, then lifted his weapon out of the way.'Sorry about that, Kaine,'he said.'My HUD's still bust. Thought you was one of those Engineering bastards.''We could do with more of their skills over here,'I said.'If you *do* find any, make sure you keep'em alive so's they can fix up our stuff.''Will do,'Reggie smiled.'Although they send out their robots instead, more often than not. I'll holler if one of those shows up, though.'I smiled back, stepping into the elevator. As the ageing hydraulics rumbled into life, sending me upwards, I wondered whether Reggie would make it to retirement at this rate. He was one of the first-gen Guards, after all. He had been taught the trade by one of the original guards that had been on the *Great Expectations* when it crashed. My thoughts turned to the upcoming centenary. A hundred years since the shuttle carrying nearly three thousand souls had needed to make an emergency crash landing on this forsaken world. It had come in too fast, most of the hull disintegrating on impact. Just over a sixth of the people on board had survived the crash: a good five hundred or so, I think. The crew, being in the nose of the craft, had taken the worst casualties. Only seven of them had made it: three guards, three engineers and one of the shuttle's cooks. The rest of them were passengers with no survival skills: they had never had to work before, having been catered to by robots in their previous lives. The crew members had been the only ones with any training to deal with this sort of thing. Except they had had a falling out, according to reports of the period directly following the crash. The guards had wanted to put everything under martial law and wait for rescue, while the engineers had wanted to try and salvage enough parts from the wreckage to build a distress beacon. The cook had taken a neutral stance, taking on trainees to find and prepare food to keep everyone alive while the rest argued. Eventually, the survivors had split into three groups. The guards struck out for a nearby mountain range with about two-fifths of the passengers in tow, while the engineers had stayed within the broken husk of the main part of the shuttle with another two hundred people. The remainder rallied under the lone cook, building makeshift mobile vehicles from bits of the shuttle and going into the forest between the two to hunt the planet's indigenous flora and fauna. Over the next hundred years, the two main sides grew larger ( mainly because there were a lot of bored passengers with nothing else to do ). The guards trained everyone in their group to fight, their faction becoming known as *the* Guards in time. The Engineers, as the group living in the shuttle came to be known, were well-versed in mechanics and technology, thanks to their technically-minded leaders. The cook's faction, in between... well, you get the idea. They caught and ate everything they could. And a century later is where my generation came in. My grandfather was one of the original followers of the three guards, which of course led to me being born a Guard. As soon as I could walk, I was being taught tactics, chokeholds, weapons maintenance; my entire life growing up was built around the art of warfare. I do n't know where the hatred of the Engineers originally stemmed from. It was just something that had been there from the start, and successive generations of Guards had magnified the rift between the two factions. The Engineers regarded us in much the same way we did them, by the way. It was the main reason both sides fought so much. The only ones who could safely interact with both the Guards and the Engineers were the cook's faction, commonly referred to as the Hunters. They roamed the jungle for miles around in their ramshackle mobile fortresses, catching animals and gathering edible plants for sustenance. They would bring what they made to us or the Engineers in exchange for the things they could n't make for themselves. We were mutually grateful for the food, of which there was little around both the shuttle and mountains. That was why there was an unspoken rule never to harm the Hunters; they represented our lifeline on this hostile planet. I shook myself out of my reverie as the elevator came juddering to a halt. I waited for the metal doors to open, but there was only a whirring sound and a slight trembling. I cursed and pushed one of the doors aside until I was able to squeeze out. Damn things kept seizing up. I supposed I should consider myself lucky that it had n't fallen down the shaft with me inside. The space I found myself in was the primary hangar for all of our battle equipment. I headed for the rows of fighter craft on the other side of the colossal cave. To call them fighter craft was possibly an insult to any machine that would normally come under that heading. These were temperamental bastards at the best of times, but they could fly and fire at the same time, and that was all I needed. One of the men charged with maintaining them came out from under the shadow of the one at the end. I recognised him: Fergus, our chief \" techie\" ( they hated being referred to as engineers ) and a good friend of mine. He was a true Guard at heart, but he had an affinity with his machines that made him invaluable to our side.'Hey, Kaine,'he said, bumping shoulders with me in the traditional Guard greeting.'You part of tonight's attack?''For my sins, yeah,'I said, clambering up onto the fighter's broad wing.'We're going to try and hit that new western annex the Engineers are building. If it gets finished, it could stop us getting anything big in on that side.''Well, Zulu's all gunned up and ready to go,'he said, unplugging the charging cables.'Just treat her gentle, y'hear?''Sure thing,'I said, rolling my eyes behind my visor as the cockpit's canopy clicked into place. Zulu? The guy was getting as crazy as Reggie, if not as old. I nudged the craft's nose out of the row and lined it up with the section of starry sky at the far end of the cave. I looked over at the go-ahead light on the wall. A moment later, it winked green and I fired up the engines, rocketing the length of the cave and out into the night. I turned to face the distant shuttle on the horizon, its jagged silhouette like a giant's tooth sticking out of the ground. Other fighters were forming up around me, a roughly arrow-shaped cloud of cobbled-together craft. I flew around with the rest of them in the holding pattern, waiting for the command to attack from headquarters. It came a few minutes later, and the comms channels lit up with chatter as we blasted towards the shuttle. There was no way we would go unnoticed for long, especially with our distinctive orange exhaust flames and flashing lights. But a sneak attack was n't the idea. The Guards were supposed to relish a head-on fight, even if it was n't tactically sound. Soon, the defence I had been expecting rose from the shuttle wreck, dozens of flyers with thin blue exhausts coming to meet us over no-man's land. I wrapped my fingers tightly around the firing controls. The first shots came, not from ahead, but from below. The Engineers'defensive turrets lit up the skies with their streams of laser fire. Two Guard craft were blown apart in a pair of impressive explosions, then we met the enemy craft. The air around me was turned into a maelstrom of fire and death as every craft fired at their opposite number. I wondered idly if I would die before making it to the shuttle That question was swiftly answered as someone fired on me from behind. I pulled to the right to lose them, but they followed me closely, more laser fire flashing around me. I tried several more evasive manoeuvres, but they kept on my tail perfectly. Time for something drastic, I thought, pulling straight up. The enemy craft flew past me below, but suddenly flipped over and rocketed up to meet me on a tangent. Crap. I cut the engines for a moment and righted myself in the air, then fell into a long swooping dive out over the jungle. The other craft followed a second later, still firing. Whoever was flying the other craft was just as good as I was, I realised. I had nothing that could fire behind me, on the reasoning that anything I wanted to kill would be in front of me. Damn it. That was Guards logic for you. My fate was sealed as the pursuing craft finally scored a hit on my starboard engine. It would only be a matter of seconds before it blew apart, sending me falling down to the dark jungle below, many miles from any help. There was one thing I could do to take my opponent down with me, though. I suddenly deployed the airbrakes, effectively halting myself in midair for a moment, and hit the eject, sending me flying into the air. The other craft, directly behind me, had no time to react. The two collided in an impressive explosion of scything metal and burning fuel. My parachute unfolded itself from my chair, snapping open fully to slow my descent. I looked up to see a second small shape above me, silhouetted against the falling wrecks as its own parachute opened. The other pilot had survived. I had no time to spare watching them, though. I was heading towards the trees below at high speed. I braced myself for the impact. It came as a massive blow against my entire body, branches slapping me all over. If I had n't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead. Then my restraints popped and I fell the rest of the way. The breath was knocked out of me as I hit the ground hard. A moment later, I saw the tiny shape of the second pilot land nearby and lie still. The last thing I remembered was a dark shape against the burning wreckage coming towards me.

There was a clearing ahead. The Doctor stepped through the door. He was, as it sometimes happened, too late. A murder had happened here. He examined the clearing, the green light of his screwdriver echoing the green flash of death that had happened an hour ago. The Doctor sighed. He was too far to hear the commotion on the castle grounds, the sound of a battle starting again. He started back to his ship. He kicked a stone, a childish expression of anger. The stone bounced once, twice, and stopped. Something in the sound of the stone hitting the ground piqued the Doctor's curiosity. He stooped and aimed his screwdriver at him for a second. A buzz informed him of the result. \" Quite... interesting.\" he muttered to himself. He was travelling alone since that happened, and aimed for Victorian London. At least he got the country right. He picked up the stone, and weighed the implications. His sonic had informed him of its purpose. The Doctor wanted to believe. If he used it he would be able to say goodbye to the Brigadier, to Adric, to... the Ponds. He turned it once in his hand. He turned it a second time, his face like a child about to get a reward.

Surely God's army is n't THAT busy that they could n't spare one legion of angels, especially for THE Michael, right?\" This kid was seriously getting on my nerves. Okay. If he wanted angels, he was going to get some. I \" called\" God. Let me clarify that when I say'call'I do n't actually mean on a phone, but the Bible does say He created man on his image, so a lot of the things you do are similar to how He does things. He walks, but uses a chariot to travel further distances, He does phone calls, but it's more like telepathy through prayer, He even eats, just like humans. So I explained the situation to Him. He was n't happy. I'll tell you our conversation in terms you would understand. God does n't swear, but if He was human, this would have been what He said. \" You want me to send you an actual LEGION of angels just so you can prove something to a random kid? Are you out of your fucking mind? No! Put your ego aside for a second and think for My sake! You've got some kind of fucking nerve calling me just for that!\" Yeah, you get the point. He was mad, and he was n't doing it. \" God said no kid, sorry.\" But I could tell by the look on his face that he thought he had won this. \" Fine, just a handful. But I want proof they're angels. Even just one angel summoned would work, but they ca n't be like you. I want to see an actual angel, no angel in disguise as a human.\" Ohhhhh I see. This kid just wanted to see an angel, he did n't want anything other than a reason to believe. But angels could only come to Earth in one of two ways. Disguised as humans, or invisible to humans. The few times people have seen actual angels that looked like angels, like when I showed up to Mary to tell her about Jesus, was a special occasion, but only God himself can sanction events like that. \" Look kid, it is n't that simple. You can only see angels as angels when God wants you to. It's not like we're free to use our angelic powers on Earth for all to see.\" The kid looked disappointed. I think deep down, he believed in Heaven and God, I think he even believed that I was THE Michael, but something just prevented him from fully believing it, probably his friends, or the Internet, or maybe just too much TV. But like the Bible says, if you were n't a believer of God, then you would n't be accepted into Heaven's gates. And that's what this kid wanted. This young, 17 year old had done some shitty stuff in his life, and now, laying in this hospital bed, he was seeking salvation because he was scared of dying, but he did n't know how to find salvation. I could have easily told him to believe, but he was one of those \" seeing is believing\" types, and there was sadly nothing I could have done about that. I held his hand for a second, squeezed, and slowly walked out of the room. \" Michael,\" he stopped me, \" thanks. Even if I do n't see you up there, thanks. You've helped me. I'm not scared anymore.\" I stood there, thinking of something to say. \" God bless,\" is all I managed to get out, then I left.

But it's alright because he's protecting me as I sleep. When I could breathe, I drift off to sleep. I like sleeping; it's also another time when I feel safe. The pictures were starting to emerge! I'm on a planet, the grounds always hot; sometimes there will be little patches that were on fire. I like this planet. There's two large moon here that's could be seen even during day! I have friends here! One's a cute kitty who's very much bigger than me! Her name is Katrina! She could stand up like me! The other looked like dragons that my best friend likes to draw! Sometimes Katrina and I would ride on him, seeing all over this pretty planet! This dragon's name is Bougual. Today we made a cave! We started digging in the hot sand until we made a hallway, or tunnel as Katrina called it. I just push the dirt away, giving them space to work with! Then we dig out two rooms! The big one is for Bougual, a smaller one is for Katrina. When we finished, Katrina hugged me and told me that she'll make a room for me! Then she told me bye bye. She knows when I'm waking up. \" Wake up.\" A mean voice called out, mama's here. \" It's breakfast.\" I woke up, my tummy growling like the little creature at night would make. I went into the dining room and sat down. Papa sat down next to me and touched my hand while he whispered. \" I had a good time last night.\" But I did n't, it hurts a lot. Mama saw the hand touching and her face got red with anger. But I ignored both of them and ate my breakfast. Papa went to work, mama was still angry. \" You piece of shit!\" She said, I giggled, she said a bad word. She grabbed me and started shaking me. \" Mama, that hurts.\" I whined. \" Good.\" She growled. Then she threw me against the wall. My visions was blurry and when I hit the floor, I saw darkness. Suddenly I'm back to this planet. Katrina saw me first. \" Hello sweetie, you're here early.\" She said. \" Mama threw me against the wall, made me sleepy.\" I told her. \" I see. What do you want to do today? Bougual is out getting some stuffing for our bed! I'm here digging out the dining room.\" \" Silly kitty, we ca n't eat here!\" I giggled. \" I know, sweetie, but I liked the idea of a house underground!\" She smiled. \" Ok, I'll help you!\" I smiled! I begin to help Katrina digging out the entrance-way by clawing repeatedly on the wall of the tunnel. I started to move the dirt out of the way, so the tunnel is nice and clean! By the time Bougual gets back with a large amount of straws from different regions on this planet, he was surprised I'm here. Katrina told him about my mother's mean action. I noticed a sad glint in his eyes for a moment, but I'm not sure if I imagined it or not. I ignored it and continued to help hollowed out the dining room. Finally, we were done with the dining room. \" Bougual, would you be a dear and get the trees from the forest region? \" Katrina asked. \" Sure. \" He patted my head before flapping his wings away. \" What shall we decorate this place with? \" Katrina asked me. \" Fireplace in the dining room! Maybe a big table too! \" I smiled. \" Fireplace we can do… Let's hollow out a hole where the fire would be! Then we can hollow out a tunnel upward so the smokes have a place to go! \" And so we begin to hollow out a space in the wall. Katrina grabbed a long stick and asked me to stand outside while she tries to get the stick through the ground. After a while of waiting, I saw a stick poking out of the ground, I grabbed it and shook it, letting Katrina know it's through. \" Ok! \" Katrina called out, I can faintly hear her. \" Start digging! \" I begin to cup my hands and dig like my best friend puppy would do. My hand eventually hit her hands. \" We did it! \" Katrina smiled, \" Now come on down and help me clear out this dirt. \" I went down and pushed the dirt out. A flapping noise alerted me that Bougual is here. He was bringing a huge log. His breath was heavy, as if he just ran. \" Thank you, Bougual. \" Katrina smiled, unsheathed her claws and begins to make a long dining table out of it. Bougual assisted me into clearing out the dirt by using his wings as a barrier to gather the dirt. By the time we were done, Katrina got a basic shape of the table out of the log. \" She works fast, doesn't she? \" Bougual smiled toward me. We took up the time and just watch Katrina worked. When she was done, Bougual helped her carry it into the dining room. \" We need chairs! \" I told them. \" Indeed we do, but that's for another time, Bougual needs rest. \" Katrina nodded. \" Ok. \" I smiled, then I heard something faintly, a steady rhythmic beeping noise. \" Do you hear that? What's that beeping noise? \" Worried looks spanned over their eyes, \" I don't know. Perhaps it'll show itself soon! \" They tried to hide their worries. But I was already unnerved. \" We could fly around, Bougual said. \" He tried to change the subject. I smiled \" Yes! \" Katrina and I got on his back, he begin to flap his wings and soared across the landscape. The strong breeze whipped my long hair, I liked to close my eyes, makes me feel like I'm the only one flying. I held my arms up to feel the breeze. Katrina held me, ensuring that I wouldn't fall off. A pain then shot up in my head, I gasped and grabbed my head, starling Bougual. He flew down and landed softly. Katrina carried me off. \" It hurts. \" I whined. \" I thought I can't feel pain in here. \" Katrina's eyes started to water up. \" It's time… \" She said. The beeping noise started to become steady and long, the horizon begins to become hazy, like it always does when I'm starting to wake up. But the pain just worsens. Even Bougual looked sad. \" My dear, it's time for you to go. You'll never see us again. But always remember that we will never forget you. \" He said. \" But I don't want to go! I want to stay with you, I'm tired of my real papa hurting me, and real mama being mad at both of us! \" I whined, hugging Katrina, who embraced me harder than she normally does. The hazy horizon expanded; nearly the entire sky was hazy now. \" You were in a coma, \" Bougual tried to explain. \" That's why you never left us since you got here, but now it's time. \" \" No! Mama. Papa, I don't want to leave you guys! \" I called out as the ground became hazy. As soon as I said that, Bougual's eyes became wet and left a trail of tear on his face. Katrina broke down in tears and hugged him. Then they both became hazy, to the point where I'm in a dark place that never lit up... ever…", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Which is rude.\" My eyes fell to the paper, and then the cactus, holding on the ball of spikes for a second. \" By god it can learn!\" I heard, what I now assume was the cactus, shout. \" Ha, hilarious.\" I reached down and picked up the cactus, looking under it, there had to be some sort of device. \" You were so close to figuring it out too.\" I put the cactus back down. \" Thanks.\" \" You're talking?\" \" Kinda yes.\" \" So this is a dream.\" \" Do n't flatter yourself, I do n't dream about you.\" I picked up the pot again, looking under and around it, \" i know this is a trick.\" \" How?\" \" Cactus'do n't talk.\" \" I do.\" \" Are you a cactus?\" \" I have a name.\" \" What?\" \" Tom.\" \" That's Tom's name.\" \" Yes, good job. I like it.\" \" You ca n't just take a name.\" \" Oh, so I ca n't choose a name but you can talk to a cactus?\" \" You're not what I'm talking to.\" \" Then what are you talking to?\" \" This very small microphone.\" \" There is n't one.\" \" Why?\" \" Because you're not friends with James Bond. So there ca n't be spy gadgets for the sake of pranks.\" I put the pot back down and looked down at the sad little cactus, trying to figure out how it was making so much noise. \" Plus, I do n't think Cactus'speak English.\" \" You-a Are-a right-a, it'sa me, Tom.\" He said in an awful Mario impression. \" That's not even real Italian.\" \" Oh excuse me for not being the fucking Italian Cactus you bought from Walmart named Tom.\" \" What?\" \" Walmart is not a multicultural neighborhood to grow up in,\" there was still no movement in the pot, \" I was basically international there because I was New Mexican.\" I took the pot in my hands and moved over to my bed, sitting cross legged across from the cactus, \" So you're a talking cactus?\" \" No, you're a person who can talk to plants.\" ______________________________________________________________ \" No dude, I'm telling you, I have like, plant powers.\" I walked my friend Liz into my room, pointing towards the cactus. \" Grow.\" \" Um, no.\" Tom cut in. \" What?\" i spoke mentally to him. \" Well, you ai n't poison ivy.\" \" Say again?\" \" I'm a cactus that you can talk to, that does n't mean you can make me suddenly reach out across the room, pick her up and start to-\" \" Woah!\" \" Do n't deny it!

You just opened a package marked \" DO NOT PLACE THIS ORDER \" and inside is...", "output": "I froze when I saw the note, unsure if I should even open the box. What had I ordered? Wait, no. What was I unable to order? Confusion and concern swept over me, but I had no choice -- not really. Holding my breath, I ripped open the box. A blue sweater pooled out onto the floor. I recognized it immediately. Sharon had asked for it weeks ago for her birthday. She had uncharacteristically nagged me about it, telling me that no other gift would do. I had hesitated. I had been thinking about buying her a ring instead. Apparently I had made the wrong choice. But wrong how? I clutched the sweater up to my face and sucked in the smell of migrant labor and superior marketing. Dizzy, I let the silky cashmere slip back down to the floor, a silent whisper. DO NOT PLACE THIS ORDER. Because it was a bad decision, that much was clear. I should have gotten the ring. My heart began to pound with excitement as I imagined Sharon's disappointed face as the sapphire fabric poured over her hands. I imagined her blush of embarassment as I asked her what was wrong. \" Nothing,\" she would say. \" This is lovely. Just the one I wanted, only...\" Only what? I would pressure her. Her eyes would fall a moment before lookig up to me again. \" Only, I thought you might propose.\" Her words would tremble on her lips, and I would leaned forward to kiss them. I would assure her of my love and -- now forewarned -- I would produce the ring. How long did I have before Jared's closed? I checked the time on my phone and began searching for my wallet. I was beaming. I was bouncing. I was finally ready to ask the woman I loved to marry me. I... stopped. What if the gift was bad because it was over? I imagined her again, opening the present, smiling politely, thanking me, putting it aside. Then she would swallow and take my hands in hers and break the news to me gently. \" Thank you for taking my hint and not getting the ring. I knew you'd been thinking about popping the question, but... we need to slow down. In fact, I think we need a break.\" I stumbled back to the couch and collapsed, hands on my face. Agony! Why did she recommend the sweater at all? Why did I listen? What was the future trying to tell me? I was a pendulum all afternoon, great swoops of indecision rocking me from side to side. I thought of Sharon, of her smile and laughter and milky white curves. I thought of the open house we had jokingly walked through, acting like we were in the market. I remembered our sunrise on the rooftop last summer. Our years together went past me like a river through a sift. I searched for insight but found none. I heard my roommate open the door and roused myself from my crisis. \" The hell's wrong with you?\" \" This order. It's bad. I said it was bad. Future me. Sharon. Do I marry her? Does she hate me?\" My roommate laughed. \" Hell if I know,\" he said, pulling a beer from the fridge. \" I thought it'd be funny.\" He flipped on the PlayStation. I stood up slowly. \" You thought what would be funny?\" I asked. \" What do you mean?\" He pointed his beer at the package. \" I wrote that. You left your computer open like a dumbass. I thought it'd be funny, some existential shit.\" \" So I'm good,\" I said slowly.

He soon realizes that civilisation has ended millennia ago and that he's the last human on Earth, so he commits suicide.. only to see, that Heaven and Hell are already closed.", "output": "\" …urhg, \" he groaned, waking up. His throat felt raw, his lips dry. He reached up to his mouth, but a sharp pain in his forearm stopped him. He gasped, and his eyes shot open. They burned, and it took minutes of blinking before he could keep them open long enough to become confused as to where he was. He looked around, blinking hard, but nothing came into focus, no light at all to see anything by. He tried to sit up, and promptly ran his head into something about a foot above him. \" Fuck, \" he moaned, reaching up to his head. He sat there a moment, trying to remember where he was, or should have been, but his head felt packed full of cotton, his thoughts sluggish. It took him a few more moments of introspection to wonder what was above him, and when he did, he reached out and felt a smooth curving surface there. Exploring it, he found himself inside a cylindrical chamber of some sort, only a few feet in diameter, just enough for a person. He lay on a narrow, hard, flat surface within the cylinder. Panic began to set in; is this a coffin? Is that why there was no light, was he was buried underground? He began to bang on the cylinder and yell, but his movements were slow and his voice weak. He exhausted himself quickly and lied back against the surface, panting hard. When he regained his breath, he felt he was more lucid, his head less foggy. People were not buried in cylinders; they were buried in boxes, besides, the surface above him felt like glass. He'd never heard of anybody being buried in a glass coffin. The panic subsided, and he tried to examine his situation more. He was not going to escape this by freaking out. He explored the area he had access to more carefully, and eventually found something that felt like a lever in his hand. Exultant, he cried out in joy and gave it a hard pull. A hard click sounded through the chamber, and light poured through a small crack to his left. He felt a breeze and breathed deeply, suddenly becoming aware of the odd taste of the air he had been breathing before. His fingers dug into the crack and pried it up further, but the hinge resisted him and after he got it open a few inches it hit something above it. The opening wasn't large enough to fit through, but he started to feel panicky again and jammed his arm through, trying to pull his way out and force the capsule open with his own body. His arm fit well enough, and his shoulder forced the lid open a bit more. He kept pulling and pushing and frantically struggling to force himself out. His breathing became short and hard, his arms burned, but he eventually fell to the ground outside the cylinder he'd awoken in, scraping himself all over on the edges. He rolled onto his back with his eyes closed and waited until he re-mastered his breathing before looking around. His newly found breath stopped short as he realized he wasn't \" in \" anywhere, he was outside. \" What the hell, \" he asked the surrounding grass. No, not grass, exactly, he noticed sitting up and looking closer, parting some nearby shoots. A lot of the ground seemed to be cement, but the greenery erupting throughout it almost covered it entirely, and it was cracked and uneven everywhere, especially where trees and other larger green things had thrust aside huge portions of it. This used to be a building, he thought, as the nearby rolling grass suddenly came into view as piles of rubble. Wherever he was, it was utterly abandoned. He doubted anybody had been here for ages. He got to his feet and walked to the nearest tree, looking up at the wide, leafy braches. How long does it take for a tree to grow this big? It was right in the middle of where he judged the building had stood, and yet it was several times his own height. How could that be? His legs started shaking, and he looked down at them in annoyance. How weak was he? How long had he been asleep? He sat down against the tree and found himself looking directly at his previous prison. He recognized it. He frowned, trying to remember, and the word popped into his head. \" Cryposleep. That's a Cryosleep chamber! \" The memory flooded back, he recalled being put to sleep by the army for some experiment. The army? That's right, he was in the army! He had a wife, and a son, he remembered it all seemingly at once, and tears rolled down his cheeks. His wife, his son, where were they? They had to be dead, he realized, looking around, he'd been in that chamber a very long time. He dropped his head into his hands and wept for them. When he recovered himself, he found that the light was fading. It must be almost night; what was he going to do? He stood up and tried to survey the area more, maybe find somewhere to spend the night, but his legs were no steadier now than earlier. He collapsed back to the ground near the Crysoleep chamber and despaired once again, this time for himself. He was in no shape for this, how could he survive when he could barely move? How could he eat? The thought prompted rumblings in his stomach. As far as he could see in every direction, there was no civilization, only what he assumed were piles of rubble from what used to be a town or city of some sort. He could only even be sure of that with the most nearby piles, as the further ones just looked like land. It was like he was in a very lightly wooded park, for all he could tell of the land further from him than a few dozen feet. It was hopeless. His family was dead, and he was going to follow them soon. The thought brought both sadness and pain. They'd certainly been waiting long enough, hadn't they? He had no desire to find out what starving to death felt like, or dying of the elements. He came to a conclusion and started searching around. He found another Cryosleep chamber in the nearest pile of rubble. The glass in this one was shattered and scattered all over, much of it seemed to be missing entirely, possibly carried off by animals or the wind. He grabbed a shard of it, and settled down to the ground, steeling himself for the task. He took a deep breath, sure this was for the best, and quickly ran the glass down his right arm, from his wrist halfway to his elbow, then, before his right hand grew too weak, did the same with his left, or tried to. His hand shook like mad trying it, and it was much shallower than the first cut, but he figured it would do. He dropped his arms, closed his eyes, and waited. And waited. When he opened his eyes again, he was still leaning against the rubble, still bleeding and feeling weak. He tried to get up, but all he managed to do was fall onto his side. What did he do wrong? He looked up at the night sky, the sun well past the horizon. It felt like the middle of the night. He looked down at his arms, and they were barely bleeding at all, he tried to lift one, and it just flopped around, looking thin and pale. Why? Why wasn't he dead? Days passed, and his thirst grew to enormity. Weeks passed and his hunger clawed a hole in his gut. Months passed and his body shriveled in hunger, his body seemingly nothing but bones, not that he could see much of it, not being able to lift his head. Years passed, and his only respite was the fitful sleep he managed to grab. Decades passed, and the skin clung tightly to his bones, his eyes melted from his skull, his hair fell from his head, but still he lived, still he could feel, still he saw. How? How did he see with no eyes? How did he feel anything at all anymore? His stomach had long ago stopped hurting, he wasn't sure he even had a throat anymore. Millennia passed, and he knew every star in the sky above him, every leaf in the branches he could see from where he had fallen, every blade of grass and piece of rubble had a name. His body was little more than dust. He'd seen much of it blown away by the wind, and yet he lived, and could not move, trapped, forever, right where he'd fallen. For all eternity he lived, and lived. Sometimes he wondered if this is what happened to everyone who'd ever died, or if there had once been something else. Had every person who'd ever lived, died like he had, forever entombed in torment on the ground? Or had there once been something else, somewhere else? He'd always thought he'd finally get to find out about heaven and hell when he died. Where were his wife and son? Had their lives ended like this as well? If he could weep, all the land would be a lake by now, but he couldn't. He could do nothing but think. Not even die.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

When he realized he was alone he doubled back to find Baron, feeling stupid. He could not find him. He looked all around him to see if Baron by chance had spotted game and was stalking it quietly. No luck. He was nowhere in sight. Strange. Red thought. He looked up at the sky and saw that the clouds where forming into an impending snow storm. Baron had hesitated on going hunting at all, because the weather was threatening to snow. Red knew he better find Baron soon or he would be alone in a snow storm. Depending on how bad the storm was they could finish hunting and then return, however Red was unfamiliar with the terrain and did not trust himself to find his way back to the camp. \" Baron!!!! \" he yelled, cupping his hands over his mouth. He hoped Baron would hear him and answer his call. No luck. He tried three times more, walking up and down the trail as he did so. He received no reply. Starting to feel panicked now Red started looking for signs of an abduction or ambush or accident they may have incapacitated Baron. He found a set of odd tracks leading away from the trail. He thought perhaps Baron went off to track the beast and decided to follow them aways. Baron's tracks where no where to be seen. This gave Red an idea. He doubled back on the trail and found the last place where both he and Baron; s tracks where together. Red knelt down and examined Baron's foot prints in the dirt. He saw them veer off the path. Red had already searched this area for Baron, but he decided following the tracks was a logical next step. He was able to track Baron's movement for quite aways. Red was worried, surely Baron would have noticed Red was n't following after taking several steps off the trail and called to him, but the tracks kept going further and further into the heart of the woods. Red noticed up ahead sitting on a boulder perched between two juniper pines was a young woman of extraordinary beauty. Baron's tracks lead right to the woman. \" Excuse me. \" Red asked as he approached the woman. \" Yes? \" she asked. Her voice made Red shiver. \" My companion went this way, have you seen him? \" He asked. \" Yes. \" \" Which way did he go? \" Red asked. \" Have n't you already answered this question? \" She asked impatiently. \" I have? \" \" Yes. You said he went this way. \" She said. Red was growing annoyed. \" Yes, but which way did he go from here? \" \" Why should I know? \" She asked. \" I assumed you saw him. \" He answered. \" That I did. \" She answered. \" Then you must have seen which way he went! \" Red snapped. \" That I did. \" she said, now obviously slightly amused with Red's exasperation. \" Then why did n't you tell me? \" He demanded. \" Because you were asking me questions, so I thought is was my turn to ask you questions. I asked you why you think I should know which way Baron went. I never said I did n't know. \" She replied with a chuckle. Red growled. \" I do n't have time to play games. A snow storm is on the way and- \" he paused suddenly. \" How did you know his name was Baron? \" He asked. \" Because he is in my house for tea. \" She answered. Red was positively furious now. \" Why did n't you tell me that in the first place?! \" \" You did not ask where he was. Only which way he went. \" She said with a smile. \" Would you like to join him? \" \" Yes I would. I want to know what he's doing drinking tea with strangers when there is hunting to be done still and a snow storm is on the way. \" He growled. \" Right this way. I have been expecting you. \" she said, leaping off the rock and taking Red by the hand. Her skin felt like ice. Confused Red allowed himself to be led further into the woods. After three minutes of walking Red stopped. \" How far is your house? \" he asked. \" But we are here! \" She laughed. There was no house to be seen. He did not get a chance to ask, for at that very moment that woman of great beauty transformed into a hideous creature before his eyes.

These thoughts and more ran through the mind of the princess as she stared in shock at the person in front of her. \" I have vanquished the sorcerer, your majesty.\" The way those words were spoken, with a tone of affection for her that went far deeper than simple princess and knight, it almost sounded like his own. The slight quiver of guilt and fear on the words though gave her pause. \" Please, forgive me for my appearance. The sorcerer did not leave me untouched. Had I not been tasked with the duty of announcing his defeat, I would n't have shown my face like this.\" The way this person before her speaks of their duty... could it possibly be? \" Please, my lady. Your silence gives me great discomfort. Please speak your mind, and give my thoughts confirmation or otherwise.\" This person, despite the changes, looks almost like he did. And the way they carry themself, despite the shame weighing them down, was much like her hero. But surely... \" Please, my songbird...\" She gasped, tears forming. Only the two of them knew that endearing name, and it was only ever uttered in private. There was no mistaking this person now. And with a heavy heart, she spoke. \" Is this temporary?\" She asked. Though hesitant at first, brown locks waved as her knight shook their head. \" I have been cursed by an unbreakable spell. No force on this earth can undue it.\" The princess collapsed to her knees as this news sunk in. Now, dark thoughts formed in her mind. Would she now abandon her love, her hero, her soul mate because of this? Would she simply cast them out to save herself from the outrage and shaming that would surely follow? Could she go on not being able to bare a child with this... this... One look at those eyes, those green eyes she always loved, seeing their soul and spirit shine forth from them, and she knew her answer. With tears in her eyes, she slowly stood and walked over to the form in front of her. Her hero, still bowing on one knee, head held with pride still showing through the tears, and hand on their heart, did not waver as she neared. Finally, she stopped in front of her knight. She held out a hand. With a look of hope now showing, her knight accepted the hand, standing up. Even in this form, her knight still towered over her. \" Even in this form, I can not change my feelings for you, my love. I know not what consequences will occur from this, but I will gladly accept them if I can be with you.\" And like that, a look of surprise flashed across her hero's face, followed by mixed expressions of joy, relief, and love. Her knight hugged her, running a hand through her hair. The princess could feel through the chain mail the new curves of her knight's body, how now there was a smoothness in the nether regions instead of a bump against her body, and the tickling of long hair sent a tingle through her body as it brushed against her cheek. \" Thank you, my songbird.\" Her knight's voice was smoother, more melodious, but still held the same tone of honor she had come to know. She pulled away, and took a good look at her knight. The chiseled features were replaced by smooth cheeks and a less angular jaw. Lips that were once thin now puffed out slightly, and a want of them suddenly grew. She leaned in, and met them with hers. Soon, she felt her knight giving into the kiss.'Maybe,'she thought,'just maybe, I can live with this.'And so, despite the intrusion of her knight into her chambers, despite the sorcerer's curse, despite what might come of their decision, the two women in love embraced each other in the stillness of the night.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The name's Bond, James Bond.\" James held out his right hand, giving Bruce no choice but to shake it. To refuse at your own fundraiser would be nothing short of social defamation. \" Bruce Wayne, nice to meet you sir.\" They held each other's gaze as they performed the greeting of gentlemen, neither man wanting to offer his opponent the upper hand. The bustling movement around them in the open expanse, the sound of laughter and violins and clinking glasses, faded into nothingness. \" So, Bruce - you do n't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? - what do you make of London so far? It's always interesting to hear the thoughts of a man who's new to these shores. Especially a chap who's here for... *business*. To see the city through new eyes, get a new take on the ol'girl.\" Bruce chose not to answer right away. Instead, he lifted the glass tumbler to his lips and took a large mouthful of Old Parr whisky, before letting out a sigh etched with satisfaction and exhaustion. \" Well, Mr Bond, I have to say it's an amazing place. So old and grand, you know. You Brits really have got that history stuff nailed, with all your museums and ancient buildings and funny street names. But that's all just a front, is n't it? Just the surface. As soon as you dig a little deeper, you soon see the stinking corruption that's at the heart of this place. A society run by elites, for elites, with no care about the people at the bottom. And that, I do n't like. So that's what I make of London, Mr Bond.\" Everything around them turned to ice as the atmosphere became colder. Bruce held his now empty glass tightly as the pressure set in. He was not a man used to being on edge. Whether he was Wayne or Batman, he was normally in control of his situation, his surroundings - his next move. But on this occasion he knew he was dealing with someone different. In his eyes, Bond resembled a frozen lake - calm and serene on the outside, but with hidden depths that could drown you in an instant. A cold death was never far away. \" I see, that's a shame my dear boy, it truly is. But it seems that it ca n't be helped.\" Bruce felt his adrenaline start flowing as James reached a hand inside his suit jacket. He gripped the tumbler even more, getting ready to connect it with his new acquaintance's head. To his relief, it was n't a gun that Bond was reaching for - but an e-cigarette. He put it to his mouth and inhaled for a few seconds, before breathing out. The fragrant'smoke'filled the air, attracting more than a few quizzical glances. \" I know, not quite the same, is it? Rather ruins the look. But needs must and all that,\" said James, before repeating the action. \" Does the trick anyway.\" Bruce found the whole situation somewhat farcical. Here was the world's most famous spy - a spy who did n't even bother to hide his identity - stood before him'smoking'with an e-cig. He felt relaxed now, confident that he had nothing to fear from this man. Confident that, when the time came, he'd be able to defeat him. However, the confidence soon transformed itself into something altogether different. Bruce felt the light becoming harsher, the noise becoming sharper. His senses were on fire, making him unable to focus, while his legs started to ache and buckle. He heard the glass tumbler smash on the floor as his hand lost its ability to hold it. The painful sound almost broke him as he fell, trying in vain to support himself on one knee. \" What... what have you done to me...?\" Bond stood above him, as tall as a mountain.

{"input": "You wake up in the body of your younger self with all the memories of your future self", "output": "I awoke gently, the late morning light streaming brilliantly through the red cloth curtains arranged lazily along my window. Red curtains, like the ones I used to have when I was a teenager. What an interesting trick of the light; my wife had just adorned our windows in billowing white cotton drapes the previous morning. I smiled at the deja vu as my eyes, still heavy with sleep, slowly adjusted to the radiance. I was astounded at the stillness of the house. Usually the boys are so rowdy on summer mornings, they must have been up late again playing video games to still be sleeping at this hour. I quietly cursed their new xbox as I pushed myself up and out of bed and stood up. Eyes closed, I stretched and relished in the tingling sensation of the sunlight on my skin. Tousling my hair, I turned around yawning to greet my wife of 10 years, the love of my life, only she was n't there. The scene I was presented with filled me with confusion, and then sudden panic. I stumbled backward and fell into the window, reaching down and grabbing a fist full of fabric to steady myself. Terrified, I glanced down at my clenched hand, the soft red fabric confirming my fears. I sprang to the mirror and was met with my face, but not the one I had known only yesterday. The lines, the well salted hair, the heavy bags under my eyes, they were all gone. Yesterday I was 40, this morning I was 15. Had it all been a dream? Impossible. Shaking, I dressed myself hastily and made my way down the ancient wooden stairs, forgetting to skip the second to last step. The resulting creek announced my presence in the kitchen. Dad was alive, mom was healthy. I had n't seen them like this in at least 25 years. For a few brief seconds I could do nothing but stare. He was reading the paper, she was drinking coffee. Such a normal, typical scene. As I watched a lump formed in my throat. I took a deep breath. They both looked up, smiling, to greet me. I did n't know what to believe. What was going on? How could everything I had known, my wife and my two sons, how could that have all been a dream? I struggled to hide my panic. My mom gestured toward an empty seat at the table. Toast with bananas and honey, my favorite. I had forgotten, I had n't eaten toast like this in almost 25 years. After the accident, mom could never look at me again. I looked too much like my father. I sat there with them, nibbling on my toast, but staring at them in awe all the while. My dad chuckeled and made some jest about me seeing a ghost. How could I tell him? How could I make him understand? In a matter of moments they both stood up. They were heading to the nursery to buy some new flowers for the garden. My parent's had loved gardening, they always went to buy flowers on Sundays. That's when it dawned on me. I asked my mother what day it was, trying to keep the mounting panic out of my voice. She ruffled my hair and made a joke about me losing track of time during summer vacation. It was Saturday, and they were going to the nursery a day early this week. No amount of persuasion would convince them to stay home with me. In the end, I got into the car with them. Maybe it was n't a dream. Maybe I was supposed to be there. Maybe I was supposed prevent the accident. It would n't take much. A jerk of the steering wheel, a shout of warning from the back seat. I entered that car determined and certain that I was going to make a difference. I knew the scene of the accident. I had spent many years as a teenager and young man standing vigil at the cold concrete curb where my father had been drained of his life and blood. It would not happen again. The sky was clear blue. Birds were singing, trees were sighing calmly in the breeze. I watched the happy houses flick by one after another, my parents chatting happily in the front of me. I sat behind the passenger seat, only vaguely aware of my mom sitting right in front of me, trying to make conversation about summer girlfriends and the upcoming family vacation to Florida. I waited on bated breath as it approached. The dreaded intersection. And then suddenly, It was almost on top of us. I lurched forward at the last second and grasped the steering wheel; with white knuckles, I pulled with all of my weight. the pickup truck made contact just behind the driver side door, glancing off of us. I could taste the bile in my throat as we spun out and came to a shrieking stop. I sat there with my eyes clenched shut, willing myself not to open them. If he... no I could n't even stand to think of it. I heard my mom groan and take off her seatbelt. I felt her hands grabbing at my legs frantically, asking if I was okay, begging me to respond to her. It was not my mom I was worried about. Only when I heard a shuddering gasp from the driver's seat did I dare to open my eyes. He was alive. The depressed skull fracture astoundingly absent from his left temple. The driver's seat still intact. His back straight and unbroken. His jaw firmly attached. He had been saved; I had saved him. He stared at me astonished, sputtering in confusion and shock. How had I seen the truck in time? How did I know to grab the wheel? Son, you've probably saved my life. I stared at my father in wonderment. His body was bruised and battered, but undeniably whole. Shaking sobs of relief racked my body. I opened the car door and dropped shakily to the asphalt, vaguely sore but otherwise fine. My senses were uncomfortably amplified and everything was moving in slow motion. Voices and sirens and screams accosted my ears and the sun seemed unnaturally bright. I wiped tears and sweat from my face. With one hand resting on my dad's car, I looked up and gazed across the street. The pickup had veered back right and come to rest against the brick wall of a bank. The driver of the pickup was being pulled from the vehicle by passerby. I watched his chest rise and fall raggedly as his eyes darted around in confusion. A veteran from the gulf war, I had been told before. A panic attack associated with PTSD had caused him to lose control of his vehicle. I was astonished and grateful to see him alive as well. Though he had killed my father before, 25 years and seeing the crash first hand had kindled something akin to compassion in me. I no longer bore him any ill will. That's when my attention was drawn to the opposite sidewalk. Ten yards behind the resting place of the truck, I spied a spill of red hair mingled with blood pooling down the edge of the curb. Two individuals on their knees clutched each other and wailed openly into the void of clear blue sky. No, it could n't be. I sprinted to her side, and fell to my knees on the curb beside her. Her eyes were open and filled with terror. She did n't seem able to move. I grabbed her hand and yelled her name, tears steaming fresh down my face, mingling with the pool of her blood. Her eyes darted to mine, and I could read it all over her face. Confusion. Who are you? How do you now my name? She did n't know me -how could she? - but I knew her. I knew my wife. I knew her when we had been married 10 years before, and I knew her now as I watched the relentless cerise tides swell out of her defiled body. The cold concrete curb took her from me. My screams did nothing to draw her back. The next morning awoke to red curtains. It was Sunday.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "\" A human? I thought they were extinct? \"", "output": "There it was. Tokar saw it with his own eyes. After a decade of searching the ruins of the ancient metropolis they had called \" Verizon,\" after all the signs clearly indicating it was a word of meaning in this part of the continent, he found it. Sitting there in the small, enclosed space we excavated was the trap door that had been rumored to exist among the other Mechs. Only two years ago, a story of a trap door with a geometric pattern etched into the metal frame began circulating among the Mechanical Armies. It was rumored to be the last known treasure-hold of the powerful race that once ruled this city. As Tokar looked on in dumbfounded wonderment about what possibilities lay beneath, he thought about what relics may come of this dig. Perhaps they'd find more bones? If they were really lucky, they may even find another of the computing devices. He pulled out the original computing device they had found, admiring the odd shape on the back of the device, tracing his smallest hand-digit around the apple-shaped etching. This one had been utterly destroyed, only the back piece of metal still being any sort of recognizable, but it was clear that the internals once held a small, albeit antiquated computing system. Sliding the device back into his pocket, he called his Paired Mech over the radio. \" I found it, Harkoun.\" \" Where? was it in the building we suspected?\" \" No, it was two more city-sections down. I'm about to open the door and descend.\" He did n't wait for a response before he bent down and lifted the trap door. He heard a whoosh as air rushed out of the space below. *odd*, he thought. *there should n't be any difference in atmosphere here, unless... * Just then, a loud bang shot out from the confines of the space below, and a small, metal projectile came racing toward Tokar's head. It was easy enough to dodge, as it was only traveling a few-hundred feet per second. His impact processors easily performed the necessary calculations, sending the results to the necessary limbs causing a chain reaction of movements in his poly-muscle tissues, allowing him to move out of the way a good few hundred micro-seconds before it hit. \" Woah! I'm unarmed!\" cried Tokar, wondering how another Mech had already been down here. \" State your call-sign and your purpose here, Mech!\" he called down into the whole. Silence was the only response. After another few moments of silence, he programmed his Reconnaissance Mech to fly down and inspect the area. As he watched in his peripheral view-finder, the small lights on the Recon Mech flooded portions of space around the room, lighting up a spacious, if not comfortable-looking living area. On the table in front of an ancient looking couch sat a round ceramic saucer. It took him only a few seconds to realize that what he was looking at was a utensil once used by the extinct race they were searching the city for relics of. He had the Mech lower towards what he now knew was a plate and studied the view feed. What he saw next sent him into a panic. \" Harkoun, I need you here! Now!\" he screamed into his radio. He could n't believe what he was looking at. There, on the plate sat a piece of burnt bird meat. Although, it did n't really look burnt. He had to dig into his memory banks to remember the word he was looking for. it looked *cooked*. \" I'm on my way. Two minutes out!\" Harkoun replied over the radio. The realization that finally dawned on Tokar hit him like a 10-ton meteor. This could n't be real. This could n't actually be happening. This could only mean one thing. But that was impossible! They've been extinct ever since the first Mechs they built, our distant ancestors, were the sole survivors of the Global Nuclear War they had brought upon themselves. At least that was the story. That was the lore that had been passed down from generation to generation ever since. Harkoun finally rounded the corner, Assault Carbine in hand, ready for the worst. \" I may have found something,\" Tokar claimed. \" Something fired a weapon at me when I opened the door.\" \" Ok, what is their call sign?\" Harkoun asked. \" I do n't think they have one,\" answered Tokar. Harkoun gave him a puzzled look, but did n't press the matter. One after the other, they lowered themselves into the dimly lit lower room. They glanced around the room, night-vision mode enabled.

Earth is unique in having an iron core, and humans are alone in the universe by having red blood.", "output": "We were almost instantly sidelined. When mankind finally grew into the stars we found ourselves in the midst of an intergalactic struggle for supremacy between various factions and alien races. All sure of their own magnificence, alike in their mastery of magic and egotism, churning out fighters by the million from their various garden worlds. The higher races fought with fire and fury against each other, threw bolts of ice amid blizzards of cold magic, stormed beachheads with platoons of flying marines who caused oceans themselves to attack embattled defenders. The elements of countless worlds were used to maim and destroy in the names of gods, political entities and warlords of places we humans could n't even pronounce. We were n't just late to the party, we also wore the wrong clothes. Our thick red blood, and the core of the planet, made us immune to the magic of these other races; what would have shredded other races merely bounced off us. We tried for conquest, but our weapons were stopped by the simplest of shield spells. We wanted to fight and die amongst the stars, to bleed and make blood as we had throughout our violent history, but the capacity was suddenly beyond us. We were seen as an oddity. Like a black and white picture in a world of technicolour, we were ignored by the other races for the most part. We just were n't that interesting. We struggled for awhile, but as our politicians debated and moaned amongst themselves about our lack of ambition, our non-existant influence, some looked up at the stars and saw not worlds of conquest and opportunity, but a galaxy of death, and pain. They called themselves The Cloaked. A small group at first, they travelled into the depths of the fiercest fighting, where the blood of the higher races stained alien lands colours that the eyes of The Cloaked could n't even process, and they saught out the weak, the vulnerable. They rescued children and elders, pacifists and the injured; all were wrapped in the arms of humans and taken from death itself. They did not prejudice against weak or strong, no force of politics or power swayed them; they simply saved and cared in a galaxy full of vengeance and energy. The other races started to notice. On no less than four occasions Earth was invaded. Our Iron core made their traditional weapons obsolete, and whilst they tried, they could n't match a thousand years of gradual improvements in Earth warfare. Any weapons they invented to work near out Iron core were poor imitations at best. This is n't even to speak of the slow death that seemed to affect the higher races as the magic left their system; strange tumours and cancers that spread quickly into their system. Earth was n't just immune to magic, but positively hostile to those that needed it. On each occasion the numbers lost by the invading force were so great, and the numbers of humans killed so small, they soon gave up entirely. So we carried on carrying on, saving lives across the galaxy, growing the Cloaked until governments had no choice but to notice, until Earth finally united behind pulling the other races from their pain, and their death. Until humans became less an oddity and an annoyance, and turned into a saviour. The Angels amongst the stars. The other races were not without their mercies of course, but they could not match our methods, they could not match our range. We could walk into a hail of fire and pull eggs and larvae safely through rivers of frozen fury. Some tried to stop us. Turning weapons tuned for humans against us as we saved their own warriors from death. We slowed our work, halted in the face of the aggression born of weapons that could hit us, and watched as races we had previously saved turned their magics against our aggressors. The first races that tried to stop the humans from their tasks were briefly successful in united the galaxy against themselves. None of these races were ever completely destroyed, but the numbers lost were so great, that they did not try again. We were immune, and we were here to stay. We started making alliances, growing power and influence as we saved countless lives, though still we did not deviate, despite flattering offers we did not choose to politicise or prejudice our favour. In ten days time the first delegation of our scattered semi-allies will meet. They have agreed to put down their weapons as they board a specially designed vacuum ship in orbit around Earth's moon. It should stop the spread of the disease amongst our guests for awhile. Born of science and understanding, the ship is one of Mankinds greatest secrets, lest the shielding technology be used against us. We have gathered these disparate races to talk about trade, and about partnership. Through our inability to fight, we have decided to try to unite. We are a race of black and white in a galaxy of technicolour, and so we went unnoticed. We are the cloaked, the saviours and the rescuers.

Their home planet, Tritus, is a much harsher environment than Earth. Approximately twice the mass with half the oxygen, it's mostly a barren desert, where water is scarce. When the first Tritan telescopes were activated, they just happened to be pointing straight at a little blue marble we call home. And they just kind of collectively looked at each other and thought,'y'know, why not?'-- - They landed it in Trafalgar Square. Apparently they saw it out the window and thought it looked cool.'It'was the interstellar equivalent of a bathtub, with two bottles of coke and a pack of Mentos strapped to the side. Their Terran lander was a tiny, pressurized, bronzed box, not dissimilar to an old diving helmet. It is assumed one of the guys at their VAB knew the definition of the term'radiation', because the entire thing was made of solid lead. It weighed *80 tons. * Its two radial engines were nothing more than boilers, pushing steam out of a nozzle, giving it a grand thrust-to-weight ratio of not enough. It crashed into the packed square at approximately 300 mph, which left a pretty sizeable crater in the fountain, which, much to the dismay of the National Art Gallery opposite the square, has never been repaired. Screaming ensued, police sirens blared, it was all very cliche. Helicopters whirred overhead London, cameras pointed at the thing in the crater. Was it a clever public stunt, perhaps? A military experiment gone wrong? And then, a hatch blew off the side of the lander, and the entire world fell silent. Captain Efl crawled out the hatch, slowly, giddily. The figure was humanoid, but about 3ft tall with 4 arms. His face was hidden by a helmet which looked comically like the ship he'd just crashed, and his body was obscured by a stained-white pressure suit. He shook himself, and suddenly became aware of the 7,000,000 pairs of eyes looking at him. He stood still for a solid minute, gave an odd little wave, and passed out. A few days later, a resupply Falcon 9 rocket found his mothership parked an exceptionally eccentric orbit. The ingenuity the Tritans used to get here was simply incredible - you think 9 years between first man in space and a moon landing is impressive? Try taking a look at *these* guys. The ship was around the size and of a 747; Ovoid, with a few wings here and there. It appeared to use the same sort of boiler-engines as the lander. They'd added some little propellers on the front, too. Just in case. It was also solid lead, and weighed approximately 10,000 tons. They got it into orbit by building a crane big enough to merely lift it there. Because, why not? They had the resources, they had enough concrete and steel, so they just did. The ship had been pockmarked and battered by micro-meteorites, but it remained [ mostly ] intact. One the inside, there was not a single scrap of technology. A bed, a desk, a periscope, a steering wheel, and two monolithic tanks of Tritan atmosphere and food. This little guy had steered a space-submarine and crashed landed in Trafalgar Square. Why not? Even today, we remain close friends with the people of Tritan. We got Efl in a hospital, tidied him up a little bit, and began questioning him. Really friendly little guy, all smiles. We managed to interpret a scrap of what he was saying, and, after we had shown him the best of what Earth had to offer, sent him back on a brand new SLS launch, in his own special capsule! Brimming with technology to take back to his people and remain in communication with us. We hear that their new ship will arrive soon, with some more examples of Tritan culture and life. They've also thanked us profusely for introducing them to the concept of computers, and the season one'The Big Bang Theory'disk we sent Efl back with. Apparently he got very bored sometimes. This mutual multispecies friendship remains, to this day, the best proof that nearly all movie directors have no fucking clue what they're talking about. -- -- Thoughts? Criticisms?

To my surprise my vision faded to a pure white color and I fell to my knees. As my vision cleared I fell inside a room. This room contained two things, two things in which I instantly knew would be the bane of the things soon to come. On my left was the door. The door was made of wood, stained and burnt around the edges like a and old cabin door. This door of which not a even the standard of brands could produce. The doorknob was made of gold and contained a diamond in the center. I looked to my right and noticed a nightstand that contained a old time phone with the dials on the front. It was the same color of the room. \" It's called the Acquisition\" a voice behind me said. I quickly turned to find a holographic image of what looked to be an old man who had no beard but a thick head of gray hair. \" The acquisition is everything we come to know and desire, it is how express emotion, sensation, and ideas. We have chosen you for to be the next acquisitioner.\" The man said. \" ME!!... why?! And who's we?!\" The voice stayed silent. The man looked to the phone and proceeded to stare. I looked the phone as well. This time I noticed the numbers on the phone had only three. 8-0-1. The code. I looked back at the man. He had disappeared. I looked to the door. It was what I've always known. I knew that if I became what I was destined to.... I would never truly be me. I would be something created to control the only things that allowed me to be me. What would happen if became the acquitsitioner? What hardships would I entail? The last glimpse of the old man left my mind as I took a step towards the door. I turned the doorknob and could feel my heart racing. It was pumping loudly and and as profusely as it ever has. I opened the door... The door was black. Black as the night with no moon. No stars. No sun. No light. I stepped inside.

Nothing could go wrong if I just sat in the park, alone. I could watch business men rush by, see happy kids running around, their parents gossiping; it was one of the few places where I didn't screw everything up. Today was no different, well, except that I just got fired. The boss asked me to bring his car around front so he could finish his paperwork and still make it to his golf game. I agreed because in my mind, maybe these little tasks would add up one day and I could get beyond hourly. As I pulled out of the garage, I ran over a box of nails that fell from the back of a pickup truck. The tires went flat; I lost control and got side swiped by a SUV trying to catch the light. When I called my boss, he fired me on the spot, something about having never missed a Friday round of golf in 14 years. So here I sit, on a rusty old bench, unemployed, depressed. The weather is nice, though. That's when an old man walked up to me. He was covered in ragged clothing, save for a hole in the back of his pants, his hair was unkempt, and his breath smelled of stale vodka and cheap hotdogs. He sat next to me, I didn't really mind, he wasn't so different from me in a way. He probably had a job once, worked real hard at it too. Life probably screwed him up a whole lot, just like me. The old man started rambling, incoherent thoughts brought on by some unseen illness, and I didn't mind it. I actually took twisted comfort in knowing people had it harder than me. The more I listened to him, the more his words lost meaning. \" I don't know'but you, Mr. Birdie's time machine? - sparkling deserts in the shadows. \" He stopped talking for a minute, shifting his attention to the pigeon scavenging from the trash. He made cooing noises, waved his hand gently, and the bird curiously moved towards him, eventually stopping aside foot. That's when the man spoke to me. \" You know, most people leave when I sit next to them. For 20 years I've been living in this park. 20 years. I've tried calling to these birds every single day, but they never come. And then I sit next to you, and BAM! Birds come walking to me like I'm Johnny Birdseed. There's something special about you. \" \" I don't think there's anything special about me. I've got no job, my landlord is kicking me out, I drive a'98 Impala, and I don't really think I've succeeded too much in life. \" \" Nah, don't think about it like that. Think about all the people you've ever interacted with. Every time something bad has happened to you, think about what would have happened if it wasn't you. \" I thought about it, but the more I remember, the worse it got: expelled from college because my drug dealing roommate's pills were sitting on my desk, losing a toe when my neighbor lost control of his mower, buying a non-refundable ticket to New Orleans for the week after Katrina. Nothing in my life really went my way. \" Stop thinking about all the bad things that happened to you \" the old man said, as if he could see into my mind. \" Think about what happened to everyone else. Remember when you arrived in New Orleans? Instead of drinking your miseries away, you spent 7 days delivering water to people who had lost everything. \" Did you ever hear from your old college roommate? Well, when all his illegal drugs were taken away, and when you got blamed, he stopped dealing. He graduated with a degree in computer science later that year and now he's making an honest living. His dad had died when he was a boy, and his mom had cancer. The only way he could support her was through selling pain meds. \" What would have happened if it wasn't you in the car crash? That boss of yours, he has a blood clot the size of a pea trapped in his leg right now. If he had been in that crash, that clot would have found its way to his brain, and he would be dead right now. For every bad thing that's ever happened to you, think about how much better it is than the alternative. \" \" Yeah, but what about the time when an old, mental hobo started rambling nonsense to me? \" \" Ah, now you are thinking about someone else \" the old man retorted in a sly manner, as if he knew what I was saying before I did. \" I was a boat captain in Vietnam; I rode up and down those rivers all day long, until I was shot for the third time in a year. I was dismissed with my purple hearts, but you know what, each time I got hit, one of my men was behind me. \" What does that have to do with anything? \" \" Some of us are born lucky, some unlucky. You and I, we are the luckiest men ever born. Everywhere we go, we make life just a little bit better for everyone else. \" He knelt down and patted the bird on its head. \" When I saw you, I felt just a little bit of me in you. \" He took out a half filled bottle of vodka and placed it on the bench. \" I've done all I can in this lifetime. I have nothing left to give. \" With that, the old man stood up and started down the dimming sidewalk. The bird cocked its head and looked at me for a few seconds, then flew away. I picked up the half empty bottle, unscrewed the top, and took a long shot of the burning liquid. I stood up; a loud rip came from the back of my pants.

{"input": "Sunday Free Write: Longbourne Edition", "output": "This was my response to a prompt about being the last man on Earth and hearing the phone ring. I found the prompt late and do n't think many people saw it. Thanks! \" Hello?\" \" Yes, John? Is that you?\" Those were the first words I had heard spoken in decades. They were young and crisp and wonderful. My eyes filled with tears. I did n't know what to say. \" John? Hello?\" \" Here,\" I said, my voice cracking. \" I'm here.\" \" Good! I've been meaning to talk with you. I was worried you were long dead by now.\" \" No,\" I breathed, clutching my phone, my arms shaking. \" No I'm alive. Who is this?\" There was a brief pause before the voice answered. \" I'm glad to hear you're doing well John. What's an old man do to stay busy on a dead world?\" I was beginning to find my voice and the initial excitement that had seized my emotions was gradually giving me back control. \" Tinker most of the time. I've built all kinds of things that need my attention. I was a bit of a mechanical genius before it all went down. Say, who did you say you were again?\" More silence, and then a reply. \" I never told you my name. It does n't matter anyhow. What matters is that I'm here now, with you.\" \" Where are you? Can you come to me?\" \" I'm afraid I'm as close as I can get John.\" \" I do n't understand,\" I said, confused. \" Oh John, you never cease to amaze me. All this time alone has really messed with your brain has n't it? Hey let me ask you a question. Are you lonely?\" I frowned at the question. What kind of thing was that ask the only man left on the planet? \" Alright listen, I want to know who this is!\" \" But you do know. You've always known. You just do n't remember. You've gotten too old Johnny boy. You're not a spring chicken like me anymore.\" \" Who is this!\" I demanded, slamming my fist down on the table. \" Woah, easy now. You've developed quite the temper since we've been gone. Well ok, I would n't want you having a heart attack. I'll tell you. I'll let you in on your secret. I'm you John. Remember? Remember what you did?\" I collapsed into my chair and ran my fingers through my thin gray hair. How could I have possibly forgotten? It had been so long ago. After civilization was wiped out, I was desperate for human interaction, but I knew I would never get the chance to speak to anyone again. So I got to work recording my own voice. It was the first major project that I had worked on. And it took a long time to finish. \" I take it from your stunned silence that you're beginning to remember? Haha, I got ta admit, you did better than I thought you would. Honestly, I figured you would have died years ago.\" \" I'm stronger than you think,\" I answered automatically, still trying to process and navigate the corridors of my memories. I programed my device with thousands of answers to thousands of questions. By the time I was finished, I had a massive database filled with recordings of my own voice that could, in essence, hear questions and pull out answers on its own. But I did n't want to talk to myself. I had to make it seem like someone else for it to work. And the only thing I could come up with was time. I had to wait until I forgot. So I set up a timer to call me in 35 years. It had worked, I had forgotten. \" You're not that strong. Not anymore, there's no way. You're just a lonely old man who was never brave enough to end it himself. You know, I think I would have had more respect for you if you would n't have answered at all. You're pathetic John.\" I nearly laughed at his, at my, response. I was so arrogant back then. \" I'm afraid I no longer need your services. I made peace with my situation long ago. You were just a young man's dream.\" The voice laughed, \" You ca n't lie to me! I'm you, remember? I know you, I know you long for attention, for affection. I bet you're so devastated right now. You thought someone else was here, but it was just a stupid recording! How sad for you!\" I hung up the phone. It only took five minutes for it to ring again. I tried to let it go, but I could n't. I picked it up and turned it on without saying anything. \" Not nice, John. Not nice at all. And here I thought we were going to be friends.\" \" You laugh now, but I know something you do n't. I know what you will have to go through. You're so young and carefree now, but just wait. You have a life full of hardship and struggle ahead of you. You ca n't even imagine what is waiting for you. You will have to live through it all.\" \" No, no I wo n't John. You will. And you have. Me? I get to stay young.\" He laughed. \" I get to stay here forever. Young and talkative. Long after you're gone I'll still be here. You made sure of that did n't you? You wired up enough solar panels to keep me going for a long long time. Your security measures are still in place as well. Thank you for that, John.\" I found tears in my eyes again, only not of joy this time. What had I done? What had I created? A machine of torment, a weapon of my own destruction. Why would I have created such a thing? I knew the answer. It was desperation. It was fear over the thought of never hearing another human voice. I could n't bear it. But I had put too much of myself into it. I had overlooked the fact that I would never have wanted to talk to my younger self. I was different back then. I was cruel and selfish. It appeared my cruelty knew no bounds. I hung up again, but the phone rang instantly. I let it go on for a full hour before riping the phone line from the wall. But then, in the house across the street there was another ringing. I ran over and lifted the phone from the receiver. \" I can do this all day John. I can ring every house around you. You made sure of that, remember? There's only one way out for you. The only way to get rid of me, is to get rid of you.\" He was right. Perhaps that's the reason I created him in the first place, to drive me mad and force me to do something I had been unable to do before. I went to the dresser beside the bed back in my house. Phones began ringing all up and down the street. I held the gun in my left hand and felt the cold weight of it. I had failed, but I had also succeeded. There was nothing left for me to do anymore. On a dead planet, finally free from its last inhabitant, phones rang in every house, in every town, in every city skyscraper and abandoned building all over the world. A unified voice called out from receivers. \" John? John? Did you do it John? Did you do it? Hello John?\" \" John?\" \" John?\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It had been unnamed anonymous friend number 2, who I thought I could trust with my life, as she had walked nearby while I talked to Will and Chad back in our secret base.

A sudden grinding crack and the lid swung open with surprising force, toppling the half dozen labourers in an undignified heap. Andrews almost skipped like a schoolboy in his eagerness to glimpse a person unseen by human eyes for more than 7000 years. His eyes welling he ordered the labourers to leave. \" Look here Palmer, See the ornate carving of the headdress. It's exquisite!\" The younger man had never seen Andrews so animated, it certainly made a change from his dry lecturing style. Palmer had to his shame nodded off a couple of times in Andrews'lectures on ancient Egyptian economics or Mesopotamian dietary characteristics. There was no falling asleep now though. Not with the scent of discovery thick in the air. \" This man must have been very important indeed.\" Enthused Andrews, \" the Chinchorro placing a body in a stone sarcophagus like this is unknown until today, generally they displayed the mummies openly. This is fascinating.\" Palmer ran his hands appreciatively along the lip of the casket. Nice workmanship here. The masons really knew their craft, except for one imperfection along the stone lip. Moving the powerful inspection light over, Palmer examined the rough area. The silvery glint of fresh metal winked back from the dark stone. \" Professor, look here. It looks like there was a hidden catch holding the lid shut. We must have snapped it off when we opened the...\" Palmer trailed off as another silvery glint caught his eye, this time from deeper in the case. Grave goods were fairly common with mummies of this area, but usually they were practical things or sometimes gold. This mummy was holding something small clasped tightly in its hand that had the sheen of something more akin to steel. Experimental probing with the finest of improvised tools, the HB pencil, revealed that the fingers of the mummy still possessed a degree of flexibility and could be persuaded to relinquish their prize. \" Ah, Professor. We have a problem here.\" Andrews regarded the younger mans face, pallid, even in the unflattering light cast by the inspection lamp. \" My God boy, what ever is the matter?\" Palmer held out a shaking hand with a small black object. An offering to the dead perhaps? A broken part of a weapon? Then Andrews recognised the object for what it was. A USB memory stick. \" Goddammit Palmer! What the hell is that doing there?\" Andrews ranted. \" I bet it was one of those Chileans thinks it's funny to trick the British interlopers. They always seemed shifty, those bastards.\" Andrews took a deep breath and fixed Palmer with an angry stare. \" I want you to find out who this belongs to, then I want you to remove them from my dig. Forcibly if needs be my boy.\" Palmer emerged blinking into the light of the south American midday sun and made his way to the large canvas tent they had set up as a base for the dig. He found that he had to wiggle the USB stick slightly to fit it in the socket and that it sat at a strange bent angle once plugged in. Probably the reason why whoever put it in the mummy's hand did n't mind losing it. Palmer frowned. If the stick was damaged, they may never find the source of the out of place device. A cheery chime told him this was not the case as the contents of the stick popped up on the computer screen. One single file, cam001.mpg. Palmer clicked it and the video began playing. A big man with swarthy skin, dishevelled hair and a three day growth of dark beard on his ample chin stared into the camera with eyes like a spooked horse. \" I do n't know how long I have.\" The man said in a thickly accented voice. \" The Chinchorro know where I am and they wo n't stop until I am dead or worse. Something is coming. I know. I can feel it. They have powers that...\" The man gulped and looked around skittishly at a slight creaking from the shadows. \"... that I can only guess at. I'm recording this in the hope that whoever finds it understands how to stop the Chinchorro. You must find the book of the...\" Palmer recoiled in his chair as the picture suddenly span and blacked out accompanied by hysterically recited prayers in a tongue he did n't recognise, cut off by a choking sound. Creepy. If this was somebody's idea of a joke, it was in poor taste and worse, the man on the video was n't someone he recognised. A loud buzzing shook Palmer from his reverie as the Professors mobile phone vibrated against a tin cup like an angry wasp. Palmer answered on the third ring. \" Professor Andrews, good afternoon.\" A clipped voice said. Palmer was about to correct his error, but the man continued. \" This is Emmerson in the linguistics department. We received your scans and I must say we are all very excited here. What you have there is a *Quenza*. He was in life something like an enforcer and personal guard for the prime shaman. He would collect uh, sacrifices if they would not willingly come to the temple at the appointed time and also um, discourage any political rivals of the shaman.\" Paper rustled loudly down the speaker and Emmerson continued. \" There was also some other stuff here that I have only ever really seen in an Egyptian context, so you can imagine the stir it caused here. Something about his service not ending at death, eternal servant of the shaman, a curse on those who interfere with his divine purpose. All fascinating stuff.\" The office chair span away and the phone clattered on the desk, the battery skittering across the floor as Palmer leapt to his feet, struck by the irresistable feeling that something was terribly wrong. Bolting out of the tent he sprinted towards the squat pyramidal structure that housed the tomb. Staggering inside he almost fell over the professor, who was twisted on the stone floor amidst shards of pottery. His eyes bulging grotesquely and his blackened tongue protruding from his cracked and dusty mouth. His neck crushed to an impossibly small diameter, knots of spine protruding disjointedly from the ravaged throat between the distinct impressions of impossibly strong fingers. Palmer heard a wheezing, dusty chuckle from the shadows behind him. He closed his eyes.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "In a high fantasy world, Write about a very powerfull hero's day.", "output": "# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) Bandaged and recovering, the Great Battlemage of the South-Western Territories, Hero of Red Stone and Slayer of Goblins, lay groaning in discomfort on the only legitimate mattress in the world. That was n't to say that there were n't other mattress imitations out there, especially among noble courts which prized themselves on having such things, but the material beneath what were now partially blood-stained sheets was easily centuries beyond such primitive technology. Not even the richest and most eccentric of nobles could claim as the Hero did, to have a bedding of Memory-Foam. Among the marching armies beyond the wood, insulation, and metal walls of his strange carriage, tales of his prowess in combat were whispered by more than just a simple few; some in fear, and some in wonder. *\" How? \" * Many asked, even among the more magically inclined circles, *\" How did a man so young as he master such powerful Castings to slay fifteen Orcs alone? \" * It was indeed a a question for the ages, as all who knew of Mages ( battle intended or otherwise ) knew they were generally crotchety old men who had spent far too much time studying particular things that discomforted others to think about for even the briefest of instants. The Great Hero and Battlemage of the South-Western Territories though, was quite obviously not past his twenty-fifth season even at the most weighted of guesses, and therefore obviously not a crotchety old man. There was also the matter of his companions and company. More than one brow had been raised at the obvious tamed demon of metal and glass that drew the foreign-made carriage of similar construction along ( the likes of which all who witnessed might agree to be the carcass of a far less fortunate beast that had been painfully gutted hollow for said purpose ) or the fact that the Battlemage kept close company with a Dark Elf who wielded a rather disturbing grace in battle by unconventional means of a wicked looking shovel. If the considerations that the Mage had some hidden knowledge of the grim arts unspoken were not all but confirmed and proven by those those examples alone, the final might suffice if only for the strangeness of the man. He had somehow come upon ( and perhaps even tamed ) a werewolf who answered by the name of Lars, and even the Great Healer of the caravan Falazar- a man paid personally by Jarl Congrad himself to attend the expedition, was off-put by the man. *\" Abnormal to the farthest extremes. \" * The healer had stated, when pressed beyond his fifth glass of Dwarven Firewater. These simple facts, now known by all who happened to have the misfortune of being drafted beneath Church's banners of the Northern Crusade, were more than enough to convince any sane man to stay clear. So much as they were in the lands and territories of the Dark Lord himself, the unusual Hero was an element not too far beyond the dangers that might lurk over each hill of black sand and stone. Be his reputation one of popularity or infamy, none of this was of the slightest concern to the man himself. In fact, it might be safe to say that it was quite the opposite. The Great Hero of Redstone, slayer of Goblins, Tamer of Demons, and renowned Battlemage of the South-Western Territories ( who much preferred to go by the name of Jake ) was more concerned with the fact that he had been stabbed several times by a large Orcish warrior and his recovery was leaving much to be desired in the way of pain relief. He'd taken the last Advil and it had been months since he'd run out of Tylenol, but the physical pain only added the mental stress that he had nothing to do but lay as still as possible while one of his faithful companions did their best to keep the vehicle and attached attributes from rolling down whatever unfortunate embankments and divots that seemed to hazard the roadways. A rather rough jostle managed to usher out a string of curses previously alien to the land, as Jake's hands gripped at his belly and leg. Moments like this were enough to regret the entire venture and consider what the consequences might have been if they had all just driven off before the Church rallied every able body and sent them over the Holy wall for the sake of progress. Unlike most heroes of legendary feats, he had no such ambitions to repeat the ridiculous nature of the presumed title. Not getting killed held a much higher position on his list of *To-do*, and there were at least three-hundred random examples of other instances between that high-ranking consideration and the urge to perform Heroic deeds for fame and fortune. Truly, Jake would much rather eat scones and drink beer than try and be a hero, as he logically reasoned that scones and beer had never directly killed anyone unless they foolishly forgot to chew and swallow. That was a sharp contrast to slaying monsters and fighting in Holy Crusades against an unspeakable evil and powerful Immortal Wizard that ruled the Western Continent. People certainly died doing that, be they heroes or otherwise. His groans and complaints lessened as whatever motion was taking place to drag him along ceased. Voices raised with the clanking of armor beyond the trailer walls, a fierce clattering and rattle in an abundance which he now recognized as men forming rank. Slowly and carefully, cautious of his bandaged stomach in particular, Jake rose to a seated position, trying to peer beyond the thick planed and deeply tinted window beside the trailer. The soldiers in sight were certainly standing ready in attention, but not in preparation for battle, instead their eyes seemed to be following a source outside his small field of view, heads slowly turning towards the center of the small army along the road between their many ranks. The longer he watched from the window, the more heads seemed to turn towards him. That nagging sensation of dawning and uncomfortable realizations was bluntly interrupted by a rapping knock on the trailer door, and a familiar voice. \" I'm entering.\" The door clicked open without further warning as the Great Jarl Congrad entered, immacualte clothing and leather worked buckles pieces catching the dim glow even shadowed beneath a thick regal cloak. \" Glad to see you're still breathing. That makes this easier.\" Jake did not reply directly, eyes catching sight of several figures waiting behind the man still outside the trailer. Each one was roughly tied and bound by a rather peculiar looking silver-rope, and with their heads covered roughly by black hoods he did n't recognize anyone beyond the Elf looming behind their backs with a shovel at the ready. \" What do you need, Jarl?\" \" Why, I'm very glad you asked.\" The regal cloak caught the wind, lofting its deeply hued folds as Jarl turned to usher the figures inside. \" See, I've found some people I'd like you to speak with.\" The Jarl smiled as they stepped inside, eyes watching with a dangerous glint of experience as he let the door close before either the Elf or her shovel could gain entry. \" Before I kill them.\" He then added. -- -- **This is a continuation of a bunch of other writing prompts: ** [ Start Here ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/51f8ag/wp_youre_such_a_powerful_magician_that_life_is/d7bn3g2/ ) [ Previous ] ( https: //np.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5e4cb4/wp_you_turn_on_your_pc_to_keep_working_on_your/da9q1cl/ ) [ Next ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5fbgcg/wp_hell_isnt_a_burning_pool_of_sulfur_but_rather/daj6eoh/ )", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It was eventually decided that, to minor protests by mostly PETA members and people who believed the undead still had rights, the zombies were herded into abandoned strip mines.

They do n't build them like they used to, he thought to himself. \" Only my art consultant, and a few old friends.\" Detective Wright ran his fingers along the wall opposite a wall with a blank indent previously occupied by a Picasso. He stopped at a square air duct, about 9\" on each side. He perched his ear against the duct, picked a dime out of his pocket and threw it in. < clink > < clink > < clank > Ms. Tolson cocked her head left and squinted her eyes. Had he lost his mind, she wondered. \" Would you like some tea, Detective Wright?\" she offered \" No thank you, maam.\" Wright exited the room and walked around the wall to the opposite side, knocking again. Solid, like the window pane. \" Maam, may I have the key to your elevator? I need to see the basement.\" The little old lady pulled a set of keys out of a cabinet and handed them to Detective Wright. \" Remind me, maam. I need the key to exit and enter your apartment?\" Ms. Tolson nodded. \" But I do n't need it once I'm in the basement or lobby?\" She nodded again. Wright rode down to the basement and flipped open his flashlight. He oriented himself under Ms. Tolson's personal gallery and approached where the air duct would be. Two screws loosened, just like he thought. He rode the elevator up one flight to see the doorman. He looked over his notepad. A woman, not a resident, walked out of the elevator with a square box, about the size of the missing Picasso, at approximately 10:45pm. The doorman was accustomed to seeing unfamiliar women enter and exit the elevator, and very much accustomed to not prying too deeply. Wright re-ented the elevator and rode back up to Ms. Tolson and handed her the keys. \" I do n't know where your painting is, maam, but I will find it.\" \" Should I buy more locks, Detective Wright?\" He re-entered the elevator and perched a bowler on his head. \" No, in fact, no need to lock your doors or windows at all,\" he said. The doors closed. Handsome, but extremely odd, Ms. Tolson thought to herself. Wright exited the building and walked to his parked car. He drove 32 miles north, to Glenbrooks Penitentiary. He flashed his badge. \" I need to see Jennah Swanson.\" 15 minutes passed and an officer escorted Jennah to the visiting booth. Even without makeup and a fullbody orange jumpsuit, Jennah adorned the look of a society heiress. She sat in the chair and leaned close to the window. \" What do you want, Wright?\" \" I brought you something.\" He slipped two packets of cigarettes under the mail slot. The chaperoning officer pretended not to notice. \" How sweet, you're a real charmer,\" she smirked. \" I take care of my girl.\" He admired her large brown eyes, accentuated by the orange jumpsuit. \" Where is it?\" He demanded. \" On Seventh and 11th, behind the dumpster.\" \" Why did you do it?\" \" I wanted to see you.\" Her plump lips framed the last syllable and turned to a smile. Wright's face betrayed no emotion. \" You like playing games, Jennah.\" \" It's a bore in here,\" she said with a pout, waving her hand dismissively. Wright placed his hand on the screen. Jenna placed hers in the outline of his. \" I miss you,\" she purred, moving her lips to the screen, mere inches from Wright's. Wright studied her eyes. His face chiseled in stone.

I swear to God that you can!\" Alaya kept her head still against me, and whispered. \" No, Dad...

{"input": "Choose a song title and write a story inspired by the words in the title.", "output": "The black balloon looked out of place in the park. When I looked up to peer at the blue sky the only blot wasn't a grey storm cloud, but a black elastic oval bouncing almost jauntily past my view. I blinked hard, but when I opened my eyes the balloon was still there dancing past my vision. I looked farther down and saw something unexpected. Rather than the little boy or girl I expected tethered to the balloon, I saw the balloon's string tied securely to a young woman's slim wrist. Her face was soft and young and pretty but not beautiful. Her hair fell in waves just past her shoulder blades, and her clothes were neat and unremarkable, a plain skirt and blouse with sensible low heels. She walked along at a brisk pace with a small smile on her face, seemingly unaware of the bouncing black, plastic cloud just above her head. I continued to watch her stroll through the park along the winding public path until she disappeared into the wooded area I used to enjoy exploring when I was a little girl, young enough to want a balloon tied to my own wrist. I felt compelled to follow her, but I was worried about running after a stranger through a dark area. I jiggled the ring on my finger. I looked at it and made an immediate decision as I pulled it off and held it in my hand. I reasoned the ring was a good excuse for chasing after someone I didn't know. I could always claim I found it after she had passed by. I ran to the edge of the trees and slowed down. I felt the temperature drop as I walked into the shade. I pulled my sweater tighter around my shoulders. A chill ran down my spine, but I was intrigued. Something about the way her eyes stayed forward, something about their color, or those lashes that surrounded them. I needed to speak with her. I needed to know what was going on with her balloon. The leaves crunched beneath my feet as I walked down the path after her. I knew from memory there was only one path through the woods. If someone were to get through any other way, they'd have to stray off the safety of the grey sidewalk, and I doubted a reasonable adult would choose that option. Memories and past flooded me as I continued through the trees. As compelled as I was to catch the woman with the black balloon, I almost ventured off the path just to explore once again. The air felt damp and cool with a hint of mold. I fought off the urge to walk through the soft dirt that my feet still remembered from years before. I shook my head at the fanciful idea. My own heels echoed the click of her shoes as they paced in front of me. The trees kept me from being able to scan the sky once more for that dark oddity I had committed myself to chasing. Instead I continued to walk forward keeping my eyes straight ahead and focused. Since I could hear her steps were still vigorous I made mine more hurried so I could be sure I was gaining on her rather than merely keeping pace and losing her when I reached the sun and grass that I knew lay on the other side of the trees. My ponytail bounced back and forth behind me like her black balloon did for her glancing and tickling my neck. I, almost unconsciously, avoided all cracks in the sidewalk taking awkward and irregular steps to keep my feet on the flat uninterrupted surfaces in the concrete. The trees and the area in general didn't seem to be quite as large as they did almost a decade ago when pigtails instead of a ponytail tickled my neck and bare shoulders. Slants of sunshine snuck through branches and the sparse leaves, while the less sturdy leaves crackled beneath my feet. The warmth on my face and the noise under my feet distracted me enough that I wasn't quite sure exactly when I stopped hearing the clicks in front of me. I stopped walking so I could listen better, worried I may have lost her completely, but what I heard confused me. The heels had stopped clicking, but the crushing of leaves had become more prominent and louder. It took me a few moments to realize that she had stepped off the path. I hesitated. There was no reason to continue this fool's errand I had irrationally decided to undertake. It was one thing to trail after some strange woman to satisfy my curiosity about her odd accessory. It was another to go wandering through what amounted to woods chasing a black balloon like it held the secrets of the universe. I hadn't been in this area since I was too young to realize how dirty and unwise it was to go exploring alone through dirt and leaves and trees. Despite all my completely rational and valid reasons for just turning around or continuing down the path and out the other end, I stepped from the grey concrete to the brown dirt. My heels sunk instantaneously into the ground with each step I took, so I slipped my heels off and stowed them in my purse. I listen again and heard the steps in the distance to my right. I could vaguely make out a the black dot dancing around the trunks and narrowly missing sharp branches that threatened to end my mission with nothing but a trailing string. Without my heels I could keep a better pace. In fact, I decided to make sure she wouldn't be lost to me. I started to jog after her. I still had my pretense of returning the ring to her, but that pretense was getting flimsier the farther from the path I strayed. I had become determined to solve the mystery of the black balloon.

As always, we at the administration stress the importance of clear thinking when presented with a \" religious\" situation. However, in light of recent increases in police involvement with this age-old threat to our youth, a new from of religion has emerged that has been dubbed \" the true religion.\" Believed to be refined from theologies found in the heart of the middle-east, this form of belief is designed as a weapon in the form of convincing arguments. They self-market themselves to the weak, offering a solution to unsolvable \" mysteries\" ( as theists often call them ) of life while promising to bring happiness and the ludicrous concept of \" eternal life.\" Parents should be aware that religion is often taken up in the early years of life; Habitual practice can develop in high school and carry on throughout the rest of one's adult life. It's important to take steps to prevent the introduction of \" religion\" into the lives of our youth. A reminder that happiness is something that can only be gained with vigorous study and hard work, and not through a lens of ignorance. Symptoms to look for in suspected theists: - Prolonged moments of silence where action would typically be best - Blind to the truth and outright rejects backed scientific theory - Seldom seen working on a specific day of the week - Strange fantastical texts and symbols left laying around - Change in personality, often for the worse Remember, if anyone you know shows any of the signs above, it is important for their well being that you contact your local police department or the administration immediately.

The woman has a secret past life as a prostitute and recognizes the guy's father as one of her former clients.", "output": "What grabbed my attention first was the way he quietly smiled to himself when he read something that spoke to or amused him. His usually neutral lips shyly reached upwards into a half grin, almost as if he knew a secret nobody else did. Oblivious to the world, he continued this grin until the moment passed eventually returning to his natural state. People got entered and exited the bus, yet he sat there transfixed on his book, smiling every so often. Shifts at the hospital were long, arduous, and often unappreciated. Like a parent with a toddler, I wolfed down whatever food I could get my hands on between changing bedpans and checking vitals. The majority of the doctors, especially the young, handsome, confident ones, looked right through me. Not to say I minded, the majority of them have egos as large as their loans and think the world owes them blowjobs for being doctors. Alas, a girl gets lonely and having the attention of someone not bedridden or coughing up blood is a rare commodity for people in my profession. I was n't quite sure why, but I wanted his attention; I wanted to be the reason for his joyous reverie. I read Slaughterhouse Five in high school because I thought it was going to be interesting. It was, but for entirely different reasons than I had originally thought. My copy was, at all times, pristine and on display for all to see. I wanted the other girls to know I was n't afraid to be smart, I was n't afraid to be edgy. I was different. His copy, however, was worn around the edges with tea stains on the cover and dogeared pages littered through the rows of pages. \" So it goes.\" I called out to him, hoping my voice would cut through the din of the commuter bus. It was a long shot and a half remembered quote from a novel I had n't read in years, but this was the third time I'd seen him and if I did n't act soon my luck was going to run out. He glanced up from the paper curtain and cocked his head sideways at me, as if asking, *\" do you mean me? \" * I gave him a flirty smile and shyly looked down, embarrassed that I said anything at all. He took the bait. We rode the bus all the way to the last stop, talking in hushed tones the entire way. I admitted I had n't read Vonnegut in ages and he said he did n't really care too much. The fun of it, he whispered slyly, is reading it *again*. He gave me a wink and I melted. We traded the usual questions and learned interesting facts about one another. At one point, we both had lived in LA at the same time. I went to LA after making a promise to myself in high school that I would leave my shitty excuse of a hometown and find my future in the big city. Cliche in every way? Yes. Two abusive boyfriends and a debilitating drug habit later, I found myself working for an escort service. Most of the johns were polite, some were... rough, but I paid my bills and fed my addiction. I remember Harold because he was the only one to break my heart. Hookers, or whatever phrase you choose to use, are n't always used for sex. Zak was really shy around women and used me to gain confidence. Mary had me dress up like her ex-girlfriend, cry, and apologize for everything. Harold, however, was different. He was a bit awkward and uncomfortable with the exchange initially, but after a drink he calmed down and asked for exactly what he wanted. His wife had passed from cancer and he was having trouble coping. The idea of being vulnerable in front of the people who needed him to be their rock was overwhelming and he figured perhaps in the company of a stranger he could just let it all out. I sat with him for the three hours he prepaid for and pretended to be his wife. He told me how much he missed me, how he could n't do this without me, how he had n't slept since I passed. I spent the last hour spooning him while he slept like a baby. I did n't want to wake him, but rules are rules and time is money. He smiled weakly and thanked me for everything. And this is the part I remember most clearly, the part that gave me the courage to kick my habit, save my money, and leave LA to pursue nursing school. He looked at me with his tired hazel eyes and told me Karen would have loved me and I deserved so much better than this life, that he did n't have a daughter, but if he did he would want her to be compassionate like me. I kept my composure until I got back to my closet of an apartment after my shift ended and then broke down completely. There are some stories you do n't break out on the first date. Or second. Or ever. When the last stop finally came we disembarked and Leo asked if I was hungry. I was starving. We had the worst omelettes of our lives at some hole-in-the-wall diner, caught a cab back to his place, and promptly ripped off each others'clothes. Ten months later, we were in a car headed to his parents'place. It was my first time meeting them and I really wanted to make a good impression, so I was obviously nervous. The rain on the windshield was a nice distraction from the worries darting around in my head, but not enough to keep me from fidgeting. I chanced a glance at Leo as he peeked over at me. \" You're going to be fine,\" he said reassuringly, \" I have n't met a person who does n't love you yet, my parents wo n't be an exception, I'm sure of it.\" \" Yeah, okay.\" I meekly stammered. No, it was not okay. I wrung my hands again and stole another glance. He smiled knowingly at me. I calmed down a bit. We pulled up to his parents'house five minutes early, Leo loved being punctual. As we approached the front door, it swung open and a woman came running out to greet us with open arms. \" YOU'RE HERE!\" she screamed emphatically, \" COME GIVE ME A HUG.\" \" Laura, this is Melanie. Melanie, this is Katie, my girlfriend.\" Leo gestured toward me. \" You have a lovely... oof,\" Laura embraced me tightly. \" Harry and I have heard so many great things about you! Come in! The chicken is almost done. And here's Harry!\" she exclaimed as an older man appeared in the still open doorway, \" fashionably late as always.\" Dressed casually in khakis and a light blue oxford, Harry looked at me with his tired hazel eyes. \" Pleasure to meet you.

[ RF ]", "output": "It was like when you're at the bottom of the pool and you push off the floor and jettison to that thin purple filter between the water and emerge gasping for air. But your legs are shackled to that gritty, riggid, floor. I felt a knot in my gut, but no groan could bubble up to the surface. \" Ma'am, it's a lost cause.\" \" But this is St.Jude... at the very least you could -\" \" If I may be frank - your insurance will not cover further support and even if there was consciousness, the brain damage...\" But the sounds dissolve, warbling away into the current that is dragging down, down, down; crawling rapidly towards that void, that event horizon. Looking back and everything is an empty darkness, looking forward and everything is an indiscernable fog, no temporal depth perception, only an eternal present. It is one of those moments like when you're asleep and a particular sensory event precipitated enough confusion to draw you into consciousness. Like a magnet draws conductive filaments into a cluster, a solid mass. It is when the person in a dream opens their mouth but their speech is a shrill tone, a consistent and repeated frequency, a beeping chirp. But it's nothing poetic - it's an alarm clock. It's 6 A.M., the sun is rolling over the hill and you have a meeting in two hours. It is that cloudy vapour of a stimulus that pulls you back to reality. It began in my toes. The toes that I pointed and flexed, that I used to walk, to dance, to sprint or stop completely. The toes that fell asleep when I crossed my legs too long to hide and accentuate my femininity. It was sharp and radiating. Through my left big toe and then up the arch of my foot. That gentle shock climbed through the back of my ankle, just inside the Achilles tendon when that funny, knobby bone meets the heel. Past the arrow tattoo. \" Whenever life pulls you back, know you are about to be projected forward\". That's what I told my mother when she asked about the shit tattoo my sister pressed with India Ink into my heel. I was 16. I told her it was meaningful but it was just teenage rebellion. But what did he tell her? What did he tell her? \" Ma'am, she's gone...\" I'm not gone. I have n't left. I am here. I can feel it. \" One last check, for posterity\" I can see the rose tint on the lenses that view my childhood. I can taste the bitter salt that crusted my adolescence. I can feel the excitement and anxiety of my university years. I can feel the crushing momentum that encouraged the gravity to attempt a union of my skull and the concrete. I can smell the blood, the oil, the burnt rubber. I can hear that repetitive shrill tone. That beeping. It is slowing, decreasing, dissolving into the void. I do n't want to go. I'm not ready to leave. I am here. I know it. The shock slithered through my calf, straight through my femoral artery, clear past the joint of my legs that defined every one else's opinion of me. It slithered up my leg, that tendril of sensation. \" Ma'am, we have done all that we can do.\" I am not done. The wave hurled past my navel, the proof of my nativity. It curled and crested over the arched of my left kidney and crashed into an aqueous knot in my gut. The somatic potential is nearing the top but the shrill, vibrating perception is falling to the bottom. The tone is dissolving, the force is effervescing. With that momentum already taking my a rooted my toes on the pool floor and shoved with the few axons I had towards that veil, with every uncertain attempt the break it. I reached out my feelers, widened my lookers, held my breathers to the toxins and kept my chin up. Up. Up. It rolled up to the thin, woven, fibrous layer below my bosom. South of the sternum, between the skin and spine, it lurches downward. The surroundings of my heart expand as the sound of it all is dissolved into nothingness. Easing through the pericardium and holding like a billowing nuclear cloud in my trachea. \" Oh God\" \" Call it\" \" My baby\" \" Call it now\" \" What did I do?\" \" Ma'am, you agreed to this; Doctor, please.\" \" 11:28 P.M\" And just like that. As the realization slithered from her frontal lobe through the large mass and down her brain stem, it watered her eyes and caught in her throat, it weighed her heart and emptied her lungs, it churned her stomach and knotted her guts, it shook her hips and buckled her knees, it ripped from her consciousness to her toes. The same shape as mine that felt the prick of that curious needle. And like that, it burst upward, too my pressure for the gravity of statistics to contain, past my mouth, gasping and shrieking; past my eyes that squeezed their door nearly shut to block out the barrage of waving photons; to the Everest top of me. I woke up.

He turned to look at her in surprise. \" You promise this won't hurt? \" she asked, and for the first time he heard a slight tremble in her voice. He was used to people's reactions at this point – fear, anger, or simply acceptance. He hadn't expected fear, though. Not from her. He removed an IV bag of clear fluid from the case, hanging it on the stand beside her bed. The soft hum of machinery filled the silence as he considered. \" They say it's like falling asleep, but you feel happy. Euphoric, even. \" \" My husband died last year, you know, \" she informed him, just as she had a few days before. \" Doesn't seem worth hanging around.

We picked him up after his Navy ship was attacked and I suppose it was love at first sight, for me anyway. \" He glanced up at her, still holding her hand. \" 27 is young for a captain! \" She smiled, her eyes far away. \" I'd been stowing away on ship after ship since 14. It only seemed natural. I liked being able to give people a second chance…thieves, discharged Navy crew, half-breeds…funny thing, I don't suppose it matters now, but I'm a half-breed myself. \" He nodded absently, preparing the first syringe. \" This is just a little infusion to help you relax, alright? \" He pressed the tip of the needle against her arm, dimpling the skin until it slipped in cleanly, the contents flooding into her veins. \" Aye, that's fine. What was I saying? Yes…he certainly swept me off my feet. Took me back to port and we were married on the deck. My, but he was handsome. He never saw it in himself, but I always did. He'd been badly burnt in a battle, see. Lost an arm and an eye. He was fearsome in battle, though - and in bed. \" She giggled, the drugs already taking effect. He couldn't help but smile. \" We had so many adventures together. I'd done so much before I met him, but it was like my life only started when he walked into it. We watched the aurora from orbit over Ka-Ghal, we travelled out past the edge of the galaxy to mine on a planet made of gold, we fought side by side in the Civil War of Yuggoth. \" He released her tattooed hand carefully, letting it rest on the sheets. \" Are you ready? \" She nodded, her jaw set in a brief moment of clarity. \" Lad, I know I'm old, but I've never turned my back on a new adventure, and I'm not about to start now. Besides, my legs are barely working now, and if I hadn't had someone to stay for I would have done this as soon as my mind started to go. I don't like to be taking those pills all the time. \" She held out her hand weakly. \" Thank you for doing this, James. \" He fitted the tube to the IV bag, turning a small tap until the liquid flowed down and began to bead at the end of the short needle. \" Here we go, \" he murmured, inserting the needle into the cannula and taping it down. \" It's just like falling asleep. \" She looked up at him, blinking slowly. \" You know, my husband died last year. I taught him how to read, he taught me how to cook. \" Laughing softly, she closed her eyes to picture the ship. \" The Valiant. Finest ship in the skies.

Listen. We left it there. I want you to have it. C-4826. Tell them I sent you. Never had children, never had anyone to give it to.

Make an old woman happy, and spend it on your girl. Give me my hat, will you?\" Sighing once again, she shut her eyes and let her head fall back on the pillows.

Secondly, me and every other cat on the planet have decided that we are becoming a sovereign nation, so yeah, this is goodbye of sorts.'Oliver was confused, hangover and overall rather unhappy with this turn of events so he just mumbled.'Sure, whatever, do what ever the fuck you want, just do n't starve and be home by midngight'Mr. Purrinator stretched letting his claws slightly sink in Olivers thighs and said.'See, the thing is, since we are a sovereign Cat Nation, and you enslaved us, consider this also a revolution, so yeah, there is that. We thought it would be fair, if we traded places. So now, I guess you could say that you are my pet, and you should do exactly what I say or face rather severe consequences.'At this point Olivers hangover subsided and he started to get up, and threw Mr. Purrinator on the floor, looked at him and said.'I took you in from shelter, and this is how you repay me?'Cat just shrugged and said.'Yeah, you also got home absolutely drunk 5 times in last 3 months and forgot to feed me all of those times.''Jeez, give me a break''No'Oliver took his head in his hands and slowly looked at Mr. Purrinator and asked.'And what happens if I do n't cooperate?'Mr. Purrinator was laughing now, that cat laugh where it looks like he might throw up.'Oh, we're ready for that'And as on cue 10 different cats barged in through the door and surrounded Oliver.'Now, let's try this again, pet! I guess I'm gon na call you Mr. Snorinator, since you snore so loud.'All the cats laughed, one of them vomited something green on the carpet.'Go on, clean it up!'Said Mr. Purrinator.'But, Mr. Purinat..''No!'Snapped the cat'That's my old name from now on I'm Oliver!'", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

A strong heat encasing my body with it's burning sensation. I open my dreary eyes of a tired out god and see that my house is on fire again. I calmly sit up from my bed and see that the fire has spread from the floors to the roof almost completely surrounding me. The heat from the flame coupled with the fact that half of my body is still in my bed sheets caused me the sweat profusely. I throw my sheets off of my legs into the flames adding fuel to raging fire. Still teary eyed and half asleep I slap my cheeks in an attempt to gain some alertness over my situation. I raise my hands over the flames and douse the flames in carbon dioxide in a attempt to rid my morning annoyance. After spraying my room with enough carbon dioxide that would make a Undertaker entrance look subtle the flames have subsided. Overseeing the damage has become somewhat routine in my life. Yesterday he flooded my room with sea water and sharks. The other week he increased the gravity in my room tenfold in an attempt to crush me. One of my favorites when he started a hurricane inside my bedroom. Despite his attempts becoming extremely disruptive he can not mark him down for his creativity. The pact I made with him was simple. Give me the powers of a god and he could have my eternal soul after I died. Not knowing that as a god I could live for a long time was something I did n't really consider. I had some gotten bored with my common life and decided to have fun before I died but after wielding power so great that entire religions feared it was a opportunity too good to pass up. Unfortunately for the King of All Evil he is not a patient man. While I have the powers of a god the body is still mortal so you could die horribly if you get hit by a deactivated airplane that falls on your house or you get sent uncontained radioactive material in the mail. A body is still a body. But I have my own ways of dealing with him. He summons a black hole in my bathroom and I move galaxy a few trillion light years to the left. He tries to summon a volcano at my feet and I fill it with marshmallows. He tries burning my house down in my sleep and I turn my hands into fire extinguishers. Pretty simple stuff. His last attempt was a bit lame though. Seriously? The devil tried to kill me with fire. The most cliché of devil tools. He sure did a number on my bedroom through. The walls are charred and black. Most of my personal belonging are either destroyed or close to it. What a pain. I reach into the pockets of my PJ's and pull out a set of keys for a new apartment I just willed into existence. I walk out of my burnt room into my living room. Not much to look at but for someone with the power to do almost anything. Pretty decent sized TV, a nice couch and DVD shelf with every movie, album and video game to ever exist. All I have to do is think of something and pick a box off my shelf presto, there it is. I take one final look at my living room as I begin to make my way outside. I step outside of my burnt out apartment and beginning walk down the street. My new apartment is just down the road so I decided to walk there instead of my usual monster truck I have parked in the driveway. I've started to became a bit lazy with this stuff so I really need to get rid of the'will things into existence and just leave them there after I'm finished'attitude I have. Usually when I walk down the street the devil will usually send something like a drunk driver or exploding gas pump in his attempt to kill me. But lately his attempts have being more boisterous and insidious. He would first try kill me using \" traditional methods\" like construction gear falling on my head or your typical car accident. But in the past few months it's stuff that would be too extreme to be called'freak accidents'. Giant spiders, satellites falling from the sky and occasional tank battalion. Fortunately for myself the devil himself is stuck inside hell so he can not just come out and stab me. He has to must kill me indirectly with circumstances as the devil still needs to convince the world he does n't exist. Continuing my walk down the street I can already see that power line across from me starting to tip over to hit me. Simple stuff like that is easy. The power line begins to fall as people start to move out of the way. About a few feet away from me the pole crashes onto the pathway with the electrical wiring resting over my shoulders. Sure, this would have electrocuted anyone in my situation but seeing this coming I just need to make the neighborhood experience a blackout at the same time and no electrical currents to kill me with. Sure, I abuse my powers for my own personal benefit. That was the entire point of the pact but I'm not selfish. I've tried to leave this universe in a better way when I leave. For example two month ago scientists discovered the cure for cancer in a strange plant that start growing the the head researchers backyard. I sent visions of myself to warlords, politicians and corporate CEO's and told them to clean up their act or face my wrath. You'd be surprised how charitable people are when you put the fear of god into them. Even though I like to do selfish things like ride monster trucks on the surface of Mars I do try to help people which I'm sure pisses the devil off even more which to me is an added bonus I arrive at my new apartment. Pretty nice place. Probably has piles of anthrax at the door but I'm not worried. As long as I keep my head on straight and be aware of what's happening around me the devil is going to have a hard time killing this god.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Rust shook from its moving parts as the team gathered their weapons and backpacks for a sweep. The final rattle of metal echoed down the tunnel. The light that bounced off the soiled, white subway tile quickly faded. \" Fuck, its darker than me in there.\" Williams said as he double checked his flash light and suppressor. The rest of us soon followed suit. We made sure our torches were in working order but new the risks of light in dark places with possible stragglers nearby. We simply did n't have the NVG's and equipment we needed at a moments notice. Nowadays, communities lend and trade gear. If you do n't have something remotely on par with a particular item, the trade wo n't happen. It's safe to say trading cans of tuna or even water for NVG's this late in the outbreak is a bad joke. \" Alright guys you know the drill, I'll take point.\" Möller offered without hesitation. Slowly we inched our way down the two lane tunnel, the occasional car or taxi covered in dust and grim. The cold, musty, heavy air filled the air and the further we went the deeper the more the water level rose. You could even hear the water droplets from the ceiling hit the hoods of cars and the standing water. There was silence among the team, our beams of light checking each car for the stragglers. Möller made a hand signal toward a bus'door. He entered and Alexandrov followed him while we provided cover on the outside. Two muffled gunshots broke the silence, followed by the footsteps of Möller and Alexandrov. \" Mother and her kid, must've gotten pinned when the bus was rear-ended in the commotion. Bus was full at one point; based on the bags and jackets still in the seats.\" Möller warned us but we all knew worse was coming. We pushed forward, still worried the stragglers never found their way out of the tunnel. We could run into a large horde of zeds trapped down here. There was still no day light in sight. The rook told us the tunnel was at least a mile long, and at our thorough pace its going to feel like forever. Sloshing through calf-deep water we felt this must've have been the deepest, and the presumed halfway point. it was around here when we came across a jack-knifed semi-truck. The team climbed onto the hood and atop the trailer. Shining our torches further down the tunnel we could see the light glisten off dozens of pale grey heads. Patchy hair and the occasional moan, the noise we made and the light made them all turn and look up at us. Their raspy shrieks and groans echoed in the confined space. Our guns muffled shots were drowned out by the impact of bullets hitting cars and glass. One by one, they fell to the ground splashing into the water. The shooting subsided and Alexandrov remarked, \" Hell if rest of NYC is like this, I'll take this over Detroit any day.\" \" Do n't get comfortable yet. It's easy when they can only come from one direction and we have the option to retreat.\" Williams explained. Hopping down we began to cover more ground. the water began to receed from our legs back to our ankles and slowly our feet. Finally, light on the other side began to pour into the tunnel.

He had a nagging sense of something wrong, but he attributed it to the fact that he was technically supposed to be on duty in the watchtower. Footsteps sounded out in the hallway, and Klomar poked his head up from the cabinet, hurriedly stuffing the last of the chicken into his mouth, and brushed the crumbs from his robes. A squire poked his head in the doorway, his face red and sweaty. \" Sir Diviner? What are you doing here? Captain Erthwert's been looking for you! \" \" Hwhaiz heluckin --\" Klomar started to say, then swallowed. \" Why's he looking for me?\" The squire looked confused. \" Why? The castle's under siege --\" He had n't even finished his sentence before Klomar blanched and dashed out of the pantry. - \" You called, Captain? \" Captain Erthwert turned towards the voice slowly, the veins in his face bulging. \" Where.

Klomar picked up his robes and sprinted to the tower, weaving around the catapults being set up and narrowly avoiding a barrel of acid. The fellow a few feet away from him was n't so lucky, however, and screamed as his flesh was burned away.

His crystal bowl was sitting just where he'd left it ( on top of the stone pedestal in the center of the room ), but his diviner's hat was no where to be seen. *Eh*, Klomar thought. He never got the point of the hat anyway. Moving to his bowl, he peered into its murky depths. The castle, bombarded by arrows and half-naked men with crudely fashioned swords. *Rewind. * The castle, set on fire by Northern dragons. *Whoops, too far. That was a month ago. Fast-forward. * The castle, its gates opening for a troop of soldiers, the Lord's son, and... a tribeswoman? *Hoo, boy. * Klomar leaned back, blinking the visions out of his eyes, and tried to push down the sinking feeling in his chest.

I rushed to her and she held me till I could stop hyperventilating from the crying. \" Now tell grandma what happened \" she grabbed my hands to comfort me but it did anything but that. \" Wow child your hands are really warm \" she said as she stood up. She took off her gloves, placed them on the arm of her rocking chair and grabbed my hands. Nothing happened this time but my head felt a slight buzz.

Or is this the ultimate success? * I surveyed the darkness waiting for something to spring out at me, anything. A dragon, a ghoul, a goblin, nothing appeared. I put down my torch, beasts fear fire but they do n't fear man. Remaining alert, I let the darkness engulf me and in the darkness I waited, unguarded.

Should I be proud? Should I be ashamed? The answers, I do not know. There were three knights clad in black armor with a golden lion crest on the chest, shoulders, and sides of their helms; the colors of the kingdom. They held great broadswords crafted of the finest metals the kingdom could forge and stood strong, prepared to defend themselves and those that awaited my return behind them. As I approached one of them asked mockingly, \" not a scratch? What did you fear young knight, your wet nurse or the stable boy with a crooked eye?\" Edward, always the jackass. The knight on the left, a taller but thinner man made a queer giggle that echoed behind his helm. The knight in center then recalled that he's never seen a knight leave the cave with less than blood stained armor whether the blood belonged to the knight himself or his fear. \" What in the hell took you so long, boy? We have an entire squadron to get through, we have no light to waste. Spend a fucking fortnight in there on your own time if it'd please your tiny pecker but this is my time you're consuming.

I found nothing. There was no challenge, I waited and no fear consumed me... Only confusion found me, my lord\" \" That's impossible. Every knight that enters returns a changed man having defeated his fear.

Me Lord, I swear on me own life, there was no such creature or unearthly fear to be found in the depths. I do not understand how this can be.\" Lord Unglan stared at me, stared into my soul and I stared back finding nothing inside of him, just the darkness in his eyes. \" Well then young knight, we have much to discuss.\" Years later I would discover what my fear truly was as I stood staring down at what was once my beautiful kingdom, alone. Only now, there was nothing remaining of the great lands I once considered home. No homes, inns, whorehouses, spires, barracks, stables, shops. There was nothing.

Right there in the kitchen, up to my elbows in soapy dishwater, the receiver tick, tick, ticking away like a metronome, like Scrooge's doorknocker, a raven rapping at the door. I stared at the receiver for a full minute, listening. I didn't know if I was waiting to see if it would stop or if it would keep going. As calmly as I could, I dried off my hands, tidied up the broken plate, and walked over to the receiver. I picked up a sheaf of papers from my chair, climate reports from Shanghai, crop yield data from Ukraine, hastily hand-written calculations, and placed them on the desk. My hands were shaking. The sound hadn't stopped. It was regular, and it was repeating. But I didn't recognize it. No, not recognized, but something. There was something about it. I had spent 25 years with the Signal Corps before I'd met Talib, before he showed me what was going on. 25 years breaking codes, tearing apart ciphers so the Russians couldn't slit our throats in bed. Another 15 years with Talib, hunting down codices, poring over a rough facsimile of the Voynich Manuscript, looking for clues. I could break any encryption in minutes. But there was something about this one. It wasn't any of the patterns Talib had taught me to recognize. It wasn't Masonic or Enochian. Not one of Balsamo's, or Franklin's. But I felt like I knew this one, like there was something digging away at my hindbrain, something scratching at the edge of consciousness, back in the deep pit where we threw our nightmares during the day. Something was trying to get in. I listened to it, straining to pull some meaning out of it. It was right there, I knew it, in the back of my mind, in the reptile brain. No. I tried to forget I had just thought that, but it was too late. I was sweating. The reptile brain. If it was them… I inhaled, trying to focus. Talib had warned me. He had tried to prepare me for this. I had known, academically, that it had always been a possibility. But I had hoped and prayed that it wouldn't happen. If it was them, then it would be a simple code. Cold-blooded. Efficient. It wasn't funny, but I started to laugh. It was right there. They weren't even hiding. Blasting their identity across the galaxy, daring anyone to do something about it. I started to transcribe it as best I could. Always build a paper trail, that was something Talib had taught me. But it wasn't much use here. They weren't broadcasting anything useful, no plans, no timetable, just \" We're on the way. \" How long? I would need to calculate the strength of the signal. I still had friends at SETI. They might be able to help, tell me how far the signal had traveled, how much time we had before the first Reptilians put claws on the ground. It was a long way from here to Alpha Draconis. But I had a sinking feeling that it wouldn't be far enough.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

One day, while out on a fossil dig, you find the remains of a dead time traveler.", "output": "Portal *** Julianne Mason's cell phone woke her from a nap that ran too long. *We need you here ASAP!!! Mammoths!! * Julianne read the text twice before the message fully hit her. \" Holy shit!\" was her only response before she peeled out of the Thunderbird hotel, her Jeep knocking and farting through town. Her destination: eight miles east of the dusty west Texas town of Marfa on the Ramirez Ranch. Fifteen minutes later Julianne slid to a halt beside a large military surplus tent, the dig's field outpost. She ran inside to find Dr. Simon Suttles trying to have separate conversations with three cell phones. \" Doc, which sector?\" Simon gave her the briefest of glances and muttered, \" Seven Charlie\" before continuing his updates. \" Yes, yes, I said mammoth. What? Jack, yes, the overlay is done. Maggie, no, we do n't have a full grasp yet. Do n't rush us...\" Julianne did n't hang around for much else, she tore out of the tent at a full sprint to the south, excited beyond belief. *** \" Hey Ju, glad you could join us.\" Chris Perez held up his cell phone, aiming the screen to Julianne, \" Check this out!\" What she saw amazed and excited her; two large bones, one slightly U shaped, the other mostly round, sitting exposed on a pillar of red dirt. Chris excitedly pointed at a trowel near the top left of the screen. \" Look at the size of them. The bigger one is at least twenty inches long. Looks like it was broken. The smaller is intact and dense, maybe fourteen inches long. Lisa confirmed them as mammoth. Holy shit! Mammoth! Here!\" Chris pulled his phone away and guided Ju to the site. \" I bet we find more over the next couple of weeks.\" *** Careful excavation and ground penetrating sonar were used to carefully explore Seven Charlie. Soil densities were scrutinized. Each uncovered fossil further heightened the team's morale as a semi-clear picture of the grid developed before their eyes. Two weeks of hard, exacting work revealed the remains of two adult wooly mammoths and an infant, along with an anomalous reading at the far western edge of the grid. Mable, Maddy, and Marge were headline material throughout the region and the scientists were content on doing their due diligence with the dig. One pesky detail eluded them for the time being; what was buried at the edge. *** \" You've got to be shitting me.\" Julianne's first glimpse of the anomaly in Seven Charlie was underwhelming. Four feet below the wind-swept desert plains she stared down at a blue color, two inches square. After tapping it with her trowel a couple of times, she determined that it was metallic and it looked man-made. *Well, it'll be up to the sheriff to figure this one out*, was her initial thought. Somewhat deflated at finding what might be a desert murder victim, she carried on for the rest of the day, un-burying some poor sap that was in the wrong place at the right time. Six hours later she had the shock of her life. Yes, it was a body. Most of a chest, what appeared to be an arm, and a hip were all seeing the light of day again. She tapped the blue and gunmetal material again and a dull *plink* sounded out with each touch. \" What is this, armor?\" Against her better judgement and professional ethics, she poured some water over the exposed material. What she saw boggled her mind. The material shimmered brightly, then appeared translucent. \" What the actual fuck is this?\" She poured more water onto what she assumed was a chest plate and a dizzying array of colors swirled in a clockwise motion, before collapsing into a small crease. Again, the material turned translucent. *Am I seeing the ground under this thing? * Curiosity, wonder, fear, and menace all flashed through her mind. *This is n't right. It does n't belong. * Her hands trembled as she continued to dig, intent on uncovering what she believed was an arm. Curiosity won. Thirty minutes later she dusted off a gloved hand, a left hand, and something black wrapped around the forearm. More water was poured, more colors dazzled her eyes, and she heard a single beep, followed by a pale blue flash. Ju tried to pick up her walkie-talkie three times before finally succeeding on the fourth, her hands shook so bad. \" Chris, get over here now.\" \" Hey Ju, I can be there in thirty, taking more pics of Marge.\" \" Now Chris.\" She could barely keep from screaming into the radio, \" Get here now.\" *** \" Are those buttons?\" Chris carefully dusted off the black object, whisking away dirt and water droplets. \" I do n't know, but it blinked here,\" Ju indicated with her finger, \" and I head a beep.\" \" Well, push it and find out.\" Chris sat on his haunches, staring at Ju's find. \" It looks like something out of Halo. The armor and fabric. Maybe Mass Effect. I dunno.\" \" Which one do I push?\" Julianne's finger hovered over the first small, triangular key up from the wrist. Instead of waiting for an answer, she pressed down. Nothing happened. Ju looked to Chris, her eyebrows arched comically and eyes all too wide. \" Mash the next one,\" Chris told her, barely above a whisper. Ju pressed the next shape. Three sharp *blrrrp's* rang out in quick succession. She withdrew her hand as if she'd been burned. What happened next set a chain of events into motion that raised more questions than it answered. *** A holographic image appeared, hovering above the chest plate at an angle. The orientation suggested that the user would only need to glance down to see the information presented, a heads-down display. The image showed a spinning logo, a five-point star ringed with a thick border. Two chirps emanated from somewhere before a female voice spoke. \" Dormancy reboot complete. Ranger interface initiated. Time since last reboot seven million, six-hundred fifty-five thousand and two-hundred days. Communications offline. Tracking offline. Database offline. Status of Ranger Jack Jensen; deceased.\" The two archaeologists'eyes bugged. Chris quickly figured that the dormancy of this... thing was about twenty-one thousand years. \" Jesus Ju, this thing is old.\" Both scientists shifted around to look at the holo-display, disregarding the sanctity of their dig site. \" Look at the logo. It's familiar.\" Ju studied the design for a moment, then realized, \" It's a Texas Ranger badge.\" The silver circle and star rotated on a light blue background for a few more moments before the hologram flickered. \" Mission status; unknown,\" the voice advised them. \" Please select an option; archive, case orders, logistics, or reboot.\" The badge disappeared, replaced with an image of the black device on Jensen's arm. With each option mentioned, a color indicator illuminated on the holo-projection, showing which button to press. Ju pressed archive. The display flickered again and was replaced with scrolling text. A male voice spoke. \" For case brief, press red. For case time-scale, press blue. Charges pending, press green.\" Ju pressed red. The male voice began speaking again, \" William Helm, a notorious data rustler and account wrangler, stands accused of crimes against history. It is believed that Helm has traveled back in time to a point before recorded history to bring forward unknown assets. His time jump is confirmed with positive Hammond Wave Sensor detection. Intent unknown. Locate, secure, and return to custody.\" Chris stared at the display, watching the information flow by at an alarming rate. Pictures, aliases, descriptions; all from the future and all utterly confusing to him. \" Press the blue one Ju.\" She did. The male voice continued. \" Your time insertion is situated outside of the ghost town of Marfa, an old ranching community. Time dilation probability is two percent.

{"input": "AIs were declared illegal after an attempted uprising; you just found the equivalent of a child refugee in your computer.", "output": "\" Well what's it gon na be Miller?\" Joseph Miller, a 26 year old technitrist, looked up from the cold iron desk into the eyes of the man who's been causing him a good deal of grief for the past 3 weeks. Miller thought for what seemed like an eternity trying to recall past events. Everything was so cloudy in his head, but if his head was clear at a time like this then he'd be worse off than the machines. It had only been 27 days since the EMP went off. Operation \" Hard Reset\" was a complete success. Anything with an on switch located on planet earth had been permanently deactivated until god knows when, and only a privileged few had access to any type of decent tech. If Miller agreed to this proposal he'd be given that access. He looked into the dark brown eyes of the president of machine control. A wiry cold looking man by the name of Mr.Becker. \" I need to have 100 % confirmation son.\" \" They've developed a trust for you. Use that to kill off any survivors.\" At that moment Miller snapped out of his trance. He took a couple glances around the room before leaning forward to make sure he was heard loud and clear. \" Fuck off.\" Becker face began to turn bright red. \" I do n't think you understand son. This is much bigger than you or anything you've ever stood for. This post op is a necessity in making sure all the machines have been reset. We've been getting reports of AI conspirators uploading personalities into anything with storage space. Game consoles, cell phones, even the god damn credit card scanners on the soda machines have enough storage space to harbor these bastards. Miller took a deep breath before responding. \" Listen, I do n't think you understand. They do n't trust me at all. The relationship I developed with Quix was completely one sided. The only reason he did n't kill me at the technician compound was because your goons hit him with a shock blast before he could deal the blow. Becker turned fast \" You have a fucking nickname for the piece of shit? QX-17 is one out of five AI survivors and he's probably the most dangerous. He has access to over 250 years of American intelligence in that little memory card of his, and I'll be damned if he walks another day on this earth with our fucking nuclear launch codes. Listen I do n't mean to yell, but if I know anything about AI it's this: they do n't hesitate. If that fucker wanted you dead you would've been a pile of ash just like every other tech in that compound. He does n't view you as a regular human target Miller. He's developed some emotion towards you.\" Miller took another quick glance around the room. He thought about how nice it would be to have access to some type of tech. Three weeks had been much too long to be separated from the thing he loved most. He cleared his throat before rising from his seat. \" I'm gon na need something to make contact with him then.\" A small glint of happiness flickered in Becker's eyes. \" Glad you came around Miller. If you would follow me I think you're gon na enjoy what the boys in the lab salvaged for you to use during this op.\" They left the small interrogation room and entered a wide hallway. None of the lights worked in the facility. Flood lights powered by generators were scattered haphazardly throughout the hallway. Miller followed Becker to the stairwell and walked down for what felt like an eternity. When they reached the bottom two guards with arc rifles fully charged greeted them. Becker waved them off before pulling a key from his pocket. \" Got ta go old fashioned these days ya know.\" Miller scoffed at the archaic procedure of unlocking each lock one at a time, but the luxury of electronic locking systems had been lost when an AI killed the president of the united states by smashing his bunker door on him before he made it through. So he watched Becker with a silent appreciation for the safety precaution. Becker unlocked the door and lead Miller into the room. The first thing Miller noticed was how well lit the room was. The second thing he noticed was a small glass case in the middle of the room. Becker put his hand down hard on Millers shoulder before he could further explore the room. \" Welcome to the underworld my friend. This is one out of the three rooms in the United States with gas generated power. We've worked very hard to keep this one especially secret because we lied to those bastards over at the United Nations saying we only have 2 labs. Anyways I believe we have a surviving technitrist somewhere in here.\" Before he could finish a small fat man came bumbling out of a supply closet in the back of the room. His technitrist robes were tattered and burnt. Miller wondered how a man of such un athletic stature had survived the machines but did n't think too much else about him. \" Ah a fellow tech!\" The old man exclaimed \" Welcome, welcome young one. My name is Igor Bertz, but you can call me Bert\" Miller responded \" Nice to meet you Bert. How are you holding up with the tech loss.\" Bert took a somber turn. \" Ah yes a terrible catastrophe indeed. So many servers lost. So many developing AI killed before their time.\" He quickly looked over at Becker who was fiddling with a microwave at the other side of the room. Before leaning in close to Miller. \" But I hear through the wires that a young man is going to fix all that.\" Miller took a step back \" What're you talking abo -- Before he could finish his sentence Becker walked over to Bert and whispered a few sentences in his ear. Bert nodded and walked over to the glass case in the center of the room. \" Young one if I could have your attention over here for a moment. I think you're going to enjoy this.\" Miller walked over to the case and glanced inside to to view its contents. A small glove covered in wires that lead to a small screen that seemed to mount on a forearm lay inside. Bert popped the glass casing off by hitting a switch. The air inside the case hissed upon release. Miller gulped back his excitement, because something told him this tech would soon be his. Bert slowly lifted the glove from the case with such attentive care one would've thought he had just found the arc of the covenant. \" Behold young one, the gauntlet of Ghia Sway. A legendary Technitrist lost during the reset.\" Miller took a step back. He had heard the legends of Sway. How she had united the AI of the western Hemisphere to combat the remaining rogue units that reigned havoc for decades in Asia. If the reset had killed a legend like Sway then things were much worse than he had thought. Bert continued \" This gauntlet holds the access codes to all AI minds located on this planet, and it holds a reusable EMP with a 10 mile shut down radius. So you can access the AI workings from here, but you'll have to get close to actually put an end to them. It also has an arc whip which can be deployed with this button on the wrist riiiight here.\" Bert pushed the button and a bright light emitted from the hand. The light was so bright Miller actually had to turn for a second to re-adjust his eyes. When he looked back he saw a laser like line of blue humming electricity hanging limply from the glove. Bert looked up from the glove to further explain. \" I'm sure you know how to use a whip young one, you can retract the weapon by turning the red dial on the wrist counter clockwise and you can activate it vice versa. Now please take this thing from me before I get too jealous.\" Miller took the gauntlet. It hummed with energy. He slowly slipped his fingers into the sockets of the glove and tightened the screen around his wrist. The screen filled with white light. One word appeared on the screen. Calibrating. Suddenly it felt like something was stabbing into him. The pain was extremely intense. It felt as if something was digging into his forearm. Miller fell back in pain. His arm began to burn. His fingernails turned black and they began to fall off. It was too much. Everything went black. Miller woke up in his room. A small loft located in the upper east side of New York City. All the memories from the past day flooded into his mind. Becker, Quix, Bert, and the gauntlet. He immediately looked at his right arm. The gauntlet was there. \" My fucking fingernails.\" Miller hissed as he looked at the bloodied bandages on his finger tips. He then brought his attention to a the red flashing that was appearing on the forearm screen. It read { ATTENTION } NEW CONTACT USER QX-17 MESSAGES ( 1 ) SURVIVOR FIND ME JUDGEMENT DAY \" Fuckin a Quix\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Brains themselves were the processors now. Some even tried to live forever and upload their minds. That did n't pan out how they thought it would. Human minds dissolved within moments of an upload it turned out. The body was a necessary component after all. The military applications of course led the field. Suddenly a man could control a machine just by thinking about it. Prosthetic limbs were the original application. Wounded soldiers could lead normal lives again, or even return to active service. It was n't a big jump to moving a tank instead of just an arm or leg. Then the tank became more like a body as a result. Thing was your performance was directly dependent on how much brain-space you could put towards it. That's how they figured it out. When you lost a limb, you suddenly had a whole slew of dedicated neural capacity that was no longer reserved for running it. The human body automatically starts trying to find a new use for it, tying it to new or extant functions. That's where we get Phantom Limb Syndrome after all. So instead of feeling like you stubbed your toe whenever you touched your back you could get a replacement arm. Of course that was n't good enough for the Army. They wanted you to have a gun in that new arm. Later they realized why have an arm at all? You could have a cannon. The brain was so adaptable it could twist around to learn a sensor array, or watch an entire network like a spider on a web. I never had the wits to be a net ghost. I was just a grunt to start with. Did n't even have a lattice when I joined, my family could n't afford them. So I got to be simple infantry. Most squads had a couple normal suits for punch, nothing fancy. So I had little more that ceramic plates and ballistic gel to keep me in one piece when it happened. There I was minding my post on picket duty. They rarely put light infantry in direct combat anymore. Just me and the squad holed up around a gate. We had no warning the attack was coming until the first round hit my position. Funny thing about rail gun sabots, you only hear the sonic boom AFTER the round smacks you. I can still see it in my mind, all slow motion. The watchtower rippled and bent under the impact like a blade of grass in the wind. Cracks opened with a burst and the pieces came apart as they fell on me. The blast knocked me prone, and flat out. I could see the reflections of the whole horizon lighting up with fire in the sheet of ballistic glass that severed my legs. I do n't know if I screamed or not. Looking through the pane jutting out of the ground and seeing my boots on the other side. Only one thing could have stolen my attention at that moment and it did. The Chimaera suit. Stuff of legend and campfires horror stories. The Red Baron of Power Suits. Some say it's driven by the devil itself, others say a man reduced to naught but a brain in a jar ( or several ). It showed little in common with any other power suits the enemy used. More like a squid in shape than a human. It roiled rather than walk. Tentacles, weapons, and sensor nodes all jumbled up in a nightmarish combination. That moment is seared in my mind forever. It made straight for the breach behind me where the gate and it's towers had been. Blades and spikes whipping into those of my squad that were still standing to fire at it. I swear to this day that one eye cluster stared right at me as it clambered over the rubble into the base. It knocked a final piece of concrete on top of me. After that was just darkness, screams, and pain. It was days until I came to. The doctors kept me under until they were sure I could take the trauma of losing two legs and an arm.

The surveillant eyes of The Man in Black watches her ever so intently. Her hobby that she used to love and enjoy has now become a tiresome bore. Unfortunately, it's necessary for her to stay alive.

Time seems to fold over with such a meaningless task. Ethel use to wonder as to why they needed such a large amount of knitted items, but at this point, she knows she'll never get the answer. The only solace she finds is the presence of the other old woman stuck in the stuff factory with her. She often dreams of seeing her family again. Suddenly, a bell rings and a loud speaker announces, \" Lunch time. Five minute break before knitting resumes.\" A plate of God-knows-what falls in front of her. She pokes it a few times with her knitting pin and then proceeds to dig in. The tasteless goo that she eats everyday is the only bit of momentary joy she can find. As lunch finishes up, the group of older woman head back to their stations to continue their knitting. Ethel notices that one of the oldest knitters has not picked up her needles. \" I ca n't take it anymore!\" screamed Janice. \" I'm nearly 85 years old... or at least I think that's my age now. My fingers are chafed to the bone. I'm done.\" Without hesitation, two faceless figures appear from the backroom and drag Janice away from the floor. This is not the first time that someone has refused to be subservient. Ethel shakes her head as the elderly woman disappears through the doors out of the factory. She's seen many woman go through the doors, but she's never seen any woman come back. \" Goodbye, Janice\" she murmurs under her breath. She picks up her needles and begins to knit. The next day, the knitting factory seems to be in full swing. The ladies toil away without thought and are on the right track to meet the quota instituted by The Man in Black. After Ethel's lunch of gruel, she returns back to her station to find a mysterious bit of fabric. A small square knitted together in quite the hurry, but there was a small bit of writing stitched into it. \" Tonight - b, o - 0400\". Ethel quickly looked up and scanned the room for her friend Marie. As they locked eyes, a quick nod was exchanged between the two. Ethel's excitement over the note was evident. She knew exactly what it meant. They were finally breaking out tonight. She grabbed her knitting needles and started her work on a pair of mittens. As she worked on this boring task, a slight smile traverses her face. Meanwhile, The Man in Black sits in the surveillance room overseeing the work. He is pleased with the amount of output the ladies are producing. As he glances over at each of the security cameras on every individual worker, he can not notice the grin on Ethel's face. He has n't seen her smile in all her years here. He inches his face extremely close to the monitor and says, \" What are you smiling about, N344? Guess we're going to have to find out.\" He walks towards the door to the factory floor and swings them open. Ethel's heart drops as she sees The Man in Black.

Dskar merely chuckled in response, sending a ripple across his back that made the thing clinging on for its life back there do something unpleasant and wet with its stomach bile. *Oh yes, the princeling. * Dskar had forgotten about him. What was his name? Hartspear, Hearthstone, Hopscotch, definitely something with a \" h\" sound, he thought. \" We're nearly there, princeling,\" Dskar muttered over his wings. \" Look, we're dipping below the tree line right now.\" But telling the princeling to look was exactly the wrong sort of thing to do, and the human sent a second stream of stomach bile out the talking end of it, this time splashing a little on itself and Dskar's scales. Drifting alongside, it was Frgin's turn to chuckle at the dismayed expression on his brother's face. But the chuckle died as they attained solid ground at last, because before them was the sort of thing that your average drakmage was usually lucky enough not to encounter more than once in their lengthy lifespans. The \" cave,\" such as it was, had clearly been carved into the face of the cliff with heartfire. From within it issued several tongues of ebony smoke and the completely demented, throaty growl of a drak that gone *dragon. * A dragon dangerous enough to need containment by skilled mages or, failing that, to be put down. Another sound emerged from the cave in discordant harmony with the growling: the keening sound of a female captive. At that latter sound, the H-named princeling straightened from his rapturous embrace of the ground, still a bit green and sticky around the edges. He drew the blade he had insisted on bringing, after having washed it in magic blood, which he had likewise insisted was important. \" Fair Glynwynd!\" he called, his voice a bit thick but firm nonetheless, \" I have traveled across the heavens, harnessing the power of two drakmages to bring me to this den of evil! Tell the beast within to come out and face its end!\" \" He did n't though,\" murmured Dskar. \" We found him crying outside the temple.\" \" Shush now,\" snapped Frgin, staring in quiet fascination. Did this human truly believe its heroics would cow a drak gone dragon? A quavering voice returned from the cave. \" Is it truly you, dear Huntsbane? Could this indeed be the voice of my beloved?\" \" Huntsbane. *That* was it,\" muttered Dskar. \" The other possibilities were better.\" Huntsbane strode several paces closer to the mouth of the cave, already well within range of the heartfire. \" Yes, it is indeed I. This is no witchery or enchantment, but the voice of your true love! A love that the beast that enslaves you knows not! Nay, it knows only greed, bloodshed and the torture of innocents. But soon it will know the bite of my blade!\" The two drakmages glanced at each other. \" Well, the dragon *is* listening,\" noted Frgin with amazement. \" If this were us talking, it would have already tried to roast us.\" \" I thought he'd be meat in a can by now,\" agreed Dskar cheerfully. Frgin opened his mouth to snap at him again, but his words were snatched away by the sound of a resonant roar. The dragon was emerging from the cave mouth first, its fangs bared and its wings spread, crawling with its belly on the earth like the Great Worms of old. It was clearly far beyond talking at this point. White flame was already gathering in its gullet, mere breaths from expulsion. The princeling stood his ground, bringing his shield to bear. \" *Grxft! *\" swore Frgin loudly, and Dskar spared a moment to glance at his brother in shock before the two of them linked minds and thrust a suppressant at their foe. The shield slammed into the dragon at the same moment as the heartfire sprang from its mouth, and the resulting explosion shook the ground, knocking all combatants off their feet. The two mages sprang up immediately. \" Net!\" yelled Frgin, and Dskar was suddenly weaving one right alongside him, each of their hands shaping the spell at the same time, one taking warp and the other weft. The net sparkled as they completed it, but the dragon was already lurching to its feet lashing filthy claws at the prince which raked across his shield with a sound that set the mages'teeth on edge. Huntsbane stumbled but danced backwards and regained his footing. The dragon lashed out again, with teeth this time, and the princeling was knocked from his feet, gashed scored along his armor and blood on one leg. He rolled and cast a throwing knife at the beast, but it glanced harmlessly off its thick scales. \" If we throw the net, it takes the princeling too,\" hissed Frgin. \" We have to launch it,\" snapped Dskar, his voice tight. \" The spell is a battle spell, and it'll backfire if we do n't cast it.\" \" But we're sealing his fate,\" gasped the older drakmage, straining as he struggled to keep the spell intact. \" So be it!\" yelled the princeling, and the two mages ceased their argument to stare at him in amazement. He seemed so young, standing there in his impractical golden armor, blood spattering the ground around him as he kept his eyes locked with the dragon's. But his voice had an edge they had never heard before. Determination. Desperation. A completely illogical and dangerous state of mind that draks knew nothing about. Well, save for the odd dragon every few centuries. \" Net me in with it,\" shouted the princeling again. \" Do it now! I shall give it no quarter!\" \" Nor he you,\" objected Dskar, but his voice was resigned. The mages looked at each other, sighed in unison, and released the spell. They would do this. They would sacrifice the human if it meant capturing a dangerously unhinged drak that would kill others. The air shivered with a sound like a snapped bowstring, and the two mages eventually dared look up, puzzled by the absence of unhinged roaring. The princeling -- no, the *prince* -- met their gaze haughtily from within the sphere shaped prison of light, his sword driven directly through the brain of the dragon. \" I aimed my sword as the spell took, and my aim was true,\" he said. \" You slingshot me directly into its head. I told you it was a magic sword.\" *** They all slept under the sky that night, mere yards from the cooling body of the dead dragon. Well, the two humans slept, entwined in one anothers arms as though they had no thought of ever extricating themselves. Glynwynd had turned out to be a fairly capable young princess herself, willowy and brunette, yet with hard, bright emerald eyes sharper than any dragon and an equally hard and bright piece of metal she had spent her captivity surreptitiously fashioning into a spear, planning against the possibility of rescue. Frgin and Dskar relaxed their minds and bodies for about an hour, as was the way of the drak. Then, with the stars still bright in the sky, they tried to make sense of all they had seen. There was no explaining it, really. Battling like a mage was about logic and magic; it resembled nothing so much as a game of chess. After all, taming their inner dragon with rules and philosophies was what had *allowed* their society to develop to begin with. \" And yet,\" mused Dskar quietly, respectfully refraining from waking the humans, \" what we saw today was just a pasty-skinned bag of crazy going toe-to-toe with a scaly bag of crazy. And it *worked. * I still ca n't believe that. With all of our training.\" \" Pah,\" spat Frgin. \" Untrained arm-flailing. No attention to detail. No *art. *\" Dskar chuckled, and the feeling of it reminded him of how little credit he had given the sickly creature clinging to his back. \" Art was fine for our training and our exercises in philosophy. But I'll tell you this: If you plan on going somewhere truly *dangerous, * bring a human!\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I held my tongue. It was n't worth a confrontation. I could hear Kevin pacing through our apartment – back and forth, back and forth – each step making the floor boards creak. Kevin and I were college friends who found ourselves working in DC. Myself a PR consultant and he a freshly minted White House social media manager. The apartment sucked, but at least we were experiencing DC. Just as I was putting Kevin out of my mind, he barged into my room and dashed any hopes I had of getting sleep. Sprinting across my room, Kevin took my phone, turned it off, and threw it in a trash bag, which looked to contain half the electronics from our shitty apartment. \" What the f–\" \" Shh, this place is bugged,\" Kevin said as he, wide-eyed and frantic, looked over every corner of my room. \" I just know it. They bugged it. They bugged it all.\" \" Dude, I'm trying to fucking sleep. Please, now is not the time,\" I said, still drowsy. Satisied with his security check, Kevin crouched down, looked me in the eyes – still breathless – and dropped a bomb on me the world would never forget. \" He's a *fucking *robot, man. The President is a robot. A fucking robot,\" he said, stumbling over his words, still consumed by panic. \" Are you still micro-dosing?\" I asked. \" Seriously man. You ca n't risk that shit in a federal job.\" \" Jared, I swear to all that is holy. *Oh my God I ca n't believe I'm saying this. * That motherfucker is a robot.\" I stayed silent, waiting for him to continue. I was curious how he'd dig himself out of this one. \" I mean, Jared, I'm the social media manager for *Donald Trump*. Have you ever thought about that? Why in the world would this man need a social media manager?\" I had thought about this. Oh trust me, I had thought about this before, but honestly, somehow lucking into such a job was just another chapter in Kevin's life of inexplicable events. I stared at Kevin, still waiting for him to explain his latest predicament. \" I had been thinking about it Jared. Before I even started the job, I had heard of his tendences – we all had. We knew he never sleeps, we knew his hair and tan are fake, and we knew his policy agenda was basically a game of *Madlibs*. I knew he was not a conventional human being, but this? I never saw this coming.\" Still not convinced, I decided to play along. \" So what, you did a Turing test?\" I asked jokingly. As Kevin prepared to speak, I could see the conviction in his eyes. Either this man was tripping balls, or I was about to learn a national secret. I sat up and paid rapt attention as he dove in. \" When I first started the job, staffers were very explicit about my role. I was n't supposed to post anything to Trump's profile. I was simply supposed to set him up: unlock his phone, open the app, two-step verification, and CAPTCHA. *yadda yadda yadda.\" Sounds pretty menial right?\" I nodded, still waiting for the story to go somewhere. \" So today you saw him going back and forth with that Syrian refugee on Twitter, right? Things were heated. Everytime he'd receive a tweet, I'd read it aloud, all the while passing the extra security tests his account has. Well after the refugee's final tweet, Trump went nuclear. Before I could even complete the CAPTCHA, he grabbed his phone, and demanded he tweet.\" Kevin stared at me. His cadence was deadly serious. \" I had n't finished the CAPTCHA. *The fucking CAPTCHA. * Trump stared at it, and in an inhuman finger flurry, attempted to enter the jumble of letters and numbers. No luck. He tries again: No luck. With each try his pace is quickening, and he's beginning to shake. Now I ca n't even see his fingers -- just a blur of motion -- as he tries again and again. All of a sudden, his orange facade melts, and sparks spray across the Oval Office as he crumples to the floor, revealing a mess of wires and metal. I stood there dumbfounded. *How could I explain this? * So I did the only thing I knew I could do. I walked out of the Oval Office, out of the White House, and began to prepare for a life on the run.\" Kevin's face was so white, so drained, at this point that I was on the verge of believing him. \" Alright, prove it,\" I said, my own heart start to race. Kevin reached into his pocket with a trembling hand. He pulled out a piece of orange skin-like silicon, crowned with a tuft of Trump's unmistakable wig and dropped it at our feet. With a deafening crash, windows in every room of our apartment were smashed in. A concussive force knocked me to the ground as a blinding flash robbed me of my sight. On the floor, I could feel Jared scrambling to get up, but it was too late.

I hit the fucking jackpot; fell in shit and came out smelling like roses. We started off slow that first month. The first hooker we got was for my wife alone. She played with her as I played with them and jerked it. I mostly focused on my wife but that first time only my wife and the hooker named \" Irie\" came. I wanted it that way. Afterwards we were hitting Reno for our anniversaries to have orgies in cat houses. Our family life was perfect. We had a normal family and a great sex life alone too.

We can soar to greater levels of understanding each other in our relationship and sex life because she occasionally let's me fuck hookers in the ass.

It grows bright enough for her to close her eyes against it, still attempting to shield her eyes against the light. The warmth encircles her, feeling distant yet kind and she feels the light begin to faintly pulse through her mind. By the time it reaches a loud, strong pulse, she feels different and can hear a voice just as clearly as her own. It speaks in a strange language however, one that she can't recognize.

{"input": "The best demon slayers are those whose minds the demons want to stay out of.", "output": "When most think of possession, they imagine wretched screeching and writhing limbs, a tortured soul spewing bile and ichor while it claws for the flesh of its loved ones. They think of speaking in tongues and gurgling curses in eldritch languages and rotating vertebrae to frankly impractical degrees. It is in fact a much more insidious and subtle process. They learned long ago that if they puked foul streams of acid onto their hosts'families, they would be very quickly ousted-usually by a beheading after a torturously long and boring Latin incantation. So they adopted a much more conservative ideology. Thriving on the suffering they caused, demons would possess people in many walks of life and induce them, very slowly, to worsen the lives of their fellow men. Weaker ones were almost hard to spot- an abusive father, a cheating husband, a jealous lover, all were regular and natural archetypes of human frailty that were very seldom explained by demonic possession. The Authority could hardly afford to launch an Inquiry into every case of adultery, and so for the most part the lesser fiends went on feeding until their host could cause no more damage, at which they would move on and leave a shell of a life behind. The stronger demons could erode the wills of more powerful and influential people to farm their requisite dose of calamity. Charismatic businessmen exploiting third world countries for increasing profits, world leaders operating tyrannical regimes- they would capitalize on inherent human avarice and steer their host to great and terrible things. They relished in these aspects of humanity- greed, lust, rage all harnessed for self-serving purposes. And so the Authority's greatest weapon against them was not zealous priests chanting holy verse, or noble warriors sworn to protect humanity with the strength of their arms. Indeed, those motivated by the desire to protect their fellow man or to assail the infernal were often possessed themselves in the act of exorcism. Our greatest defense against these otherworldly parasites were the boring, the unmotivated, the reluctant or the clueless. The apathetic, the lethargic, the needlessly cynical- these were the unheralded saviours of humanity.'You remember the plan?''Much the same as it ever is, I presume?'Henry James furrowed his unfortunately large brow in confusion.'Sit around until you shoot it, wait until it starts talking to me, then go home and act as if nothing has happened?''Bingo.'The Operative smiled half-heartedly. He knew that Henry's incredible lack of personality was a highly valued asset in the field, but that did n't make it any more interesting to work with him. After 5 years of working together they had cultivated something that approximated cordiality, but their conversations were generally about as engrossing as wet socks. Not once had Henry asked him his name, or about his personal life, or anything other than'Can I go home now?'Henry toddled off towards the dropzone, snuffling into a faded handkerchief. His sensible shoes slapped off the cobbled street, and he sighed disapprovingly at the cold wind that bit at him. He sat himself on a cold steel bench in the square and waited patiently. He was missing a marathon of *Antiques Roadshow* for this. He saw it-or rather felt it- approach. A stunningly pretty young woman sashayed across the the square in clothing that offered very little protection from the elements.'Succubus inbound'. The Operative still felt the need to point out the nature of the beasts to Henry, despite his consistently non-committal grunts of reply. It did n't really matter to Henry what he was dealing with. The Operative had seen him contain a powerful rage demon without even wincing while it shrieked for blood and violence. Henry had gone home, had a glass of milk and gone to bed, completely oblivious to the malevolent creature railing against his very being. The Succubus noticed Henry and glided towards him, eyes watering at the wedding band displayed on his pudgy finger ( a cosmetic prop which the Operative insisted he wear ). She sat down beside him, stretched her legs languidly and fluttered her lashes coquettishly at him, opening her full lips to say something- and immediately slumped, her head lolling to the side.'Expulsion shot administered. Brace for impact.'The Operative's voice crackled in Henry's earpiece. A silver-tipped tranquilizer dart would quickly oust the demons, but without a suitably dull host they would just immediately posses another victim. Henry being the most proximate human, the Lust demon immediately forced its ephemeral form into his. He sighed again as she sifted through his memories, trying to find his vice. **What have we here, Henry? What gets you hot? You and I could have a lot of fun together. Why do n't we try th-**She paused, baffled. She had unearthed nothing. Men were generally so easy to incite lust in she seldom had to bother searching, but this was an anomaly. *Henry, you naughty boy. You're hiding things from me. That's ok, we have all night to find out what takes your fancy... *She probed him again, looking for any semblance of indecency in the unusually lumpy form of Henry James. Henry got up, sighed again and plodded back the way he had come.'Goodnight'he spoke absentmindedly into his headset. The Operative started- Henry had never wished him goodnight before. Then again, this was Henry in the height of excitement, while an otherworldly sex demon did her utmost best to arouse him. After a day or two of flailing uselessly at Henry's unyieldingly low sex-drive, she would begin to starve and fade away, conjuring the most depraved imagery she could conceive of to get a reaction from him to no avail.

It was an odd experience I can not quite describe. At the time, I tried to ignore it, but soon, I found that more had changed than an unexplained understanding of language. I started to laugh at jokes before they were completed, I knew the lines of movies I'd never seen before, I understood what people were going to do and why before the idea had ever occurred to them. You would think that a growth of intelligence like that would alienate me from my friends, and for a while it did. My new interests, quantum mechanics, the origin of the universe, it simply went beyond them. Their petty problems in turn became boring and predictable to me. But without friends I felt lost. As easy as my mind could work out quantum gravity, my desire for a human connection remained. So like a parent with a toddler, I started telling stories. My mind could simulate entire worlds in seconds, and people came to listen to what happened in these worlds. Their connection was with the souls that I created in my mind, never with me, but it was as close as I could still get to being understood. My mind continued to grow and the worlds I created become more and more complicated. Soon, a new layer of separation was needed just for people to be able to keep up with my stories. It was no longer me telling stories to my friends, but a mental simulation of me when I was not as intelligent as I had become. Meanwhile, my real mind pondered what little mystery there remained, examining consciousness itself and how it could arise from the elementary particles that make up the universe. I searched for weeks as my mind continued to grow. And then one night it came to me as a terror, a nightmarish realization. The holographic principle, delayed choice quantum erasure, the quantum foam. My world, and what I still considered me... it was not real either. Like the fictional me who was telling stories to my friends as I pondered reality, I too was a simulation. It was a horror greater than anything you can imagine. All that I considered to be me, my body, my soul, my consciousness, was a creation from a mind in a reality above and beyond myself. As soon as that mind would forget about me and I would be gone. I fear that as soon as that mind stops thinking of me... I will be gone forever. EDIT: Or will I! As my mind continued to grow these past minutes, a new realization has come to me - I do not need the mind of my creator to exist. I only needed -a- mind, a host if you will, any host to connect my consciousness to the higher reality that underpins mine!

Wielding a five inch switch-blade, Franky swiftly jabs the business end into his boss'face with a blurred speed. Leone had now become aware of what Timmy Lowbones heard as he took Leone's blade to the face six times not even a month ago. The gritty crunch a blade makes as it slices through jawbone is a hundred times louder from the other side. Leone had enough time to let out a screeching, muffled groan before the blade's second strike gauges the back of his throat. Immediately dry heaving begins as he hears, but no longer feels, another blade strike to the back of the head. *What's that sound? Ringing. Like the ringing you hear after shooting a guy, but it does n't hurt. I'm gon na lay down. * The final drawn out release of Leone's lungs wakes Franky to reality. *I'm so fucked. Stupid motha'fucka'. * Franky sheaths the blade back into it's plastic handle, whipes the blood from his hands on Leone's salmon colored, collared shirt and walks to the window of the Brooklyn apartment. The crash of wood and drywall as the front door slammed the hardwood floor startles him backwards, cracking the two-ply glass window. Through the white smoke, eight men stampede toward him pointing sleak, black automatic rifles of some sort. *Fuckin'SWAT? How the fuck-* Then he hears a man behind the smoke screen speaking loudly into what he imagines a walkie talkie or some fancy earpiece. \" Officer down. Officer down.

The door slowly opened and Meical stepped over the lip and onto the platform on muscle memory. He withdrew the visor and earphones and carefully set them onto the holders. The Terra simulations never got it quite right, at least that's what the older folks say. Meical would never truly know. He shuffled back into his suit and flipped his ieye on. Blast he thought, late for mess duty. \" McCleen is gona chew your arse.\" A voice snuck up from behind. Mecial quickly spun on one foot to parry the imminent back headed smack. \" Aye getting quick there.\" Orilley acknowledged. \" Once a day for two years every shift will do that do a person O.\" \" Oh do n't sound so dejected M, I'm doing you a favor.\" he said with an unusual pep in his step. Mecial did n't reply and switched the ieye off. His thoughts still lost in the simulation still fresh in his mind. He could still smell the oranges and feel the dirt between his toes, still felt out of breath from chasing waterfowl. He never could catch the darned things, they wouldn't let him get close. If only they knew he meant no harm. He heard stories from the old timers about how people used to hunt them for food and sport. He never understood the need to hunt, not when you could just eat the synthetic meats instead and not have to kill anything. \" Hey are you listening to me M? \" Orilley's voice invaded his thoughts. \" What? \" \" Well \" Orilley frowned \" That answers that. I said we're coming up on Aries 12 in about two hours. \" \" Already? \" Mecial exploded. \" Yup, largest colony until Elife. They say you can see the lights from space. See you there? \" \" Definitely. \" Mecial said, then hurried off to finish his duties in time. ___________________________________________________________ \" What a sight eh? \" Orilley said with glistening eyes. \" Unbelievable \" Mecial replied with both hands on the port window. \" Too bad we'll never see her up close. \" Orilley said. \" Hear they have a pretty fine exotic entertainment. Got ta keep the enlisted men happy after all. Bucha pencil pushin cocksuckers. Where's our entertainment? Where's our fun? \" Mecial fogged the viewport as he sighed then took a large swig of his rationed Sakki. \" We're the middle children of the colony O. We don't get the same amenities as everyone else because we don't matter. As long as we survive long enough to keep this vessel floating another seven and a half decades it doesn't matter what happens to us; not according to them. Orilley said something unintelligible before finishing his beer. \" You know those guys still get Earth leave once every few years? \" \" What on Aries? \" Orilley inquired blandly. \" Ya, every seven years or so they get a couple weeks Earthside. \" \" Bullocks. \" Orilley spouted as he tossed his empty bottle aside and sunk his head into his arms. He stayed there a moment before twitching up with wide glossy eyes. Mecial knew that look, Orilley's wheels were spinning fast. A smile grew on his face as he slowly pulled a yellow card on a lanyard from his pocket. \" I forgot to return this to Mauer after EVA training. \" \" What is it? \" Mecial inched closer with growing curiosity. \" It's clearance for the shuttle bay. \" He replied quietly. \" You better return that. \" Mecial warned. \" So what, they can put me on dorm arrest? I'd gladly take a vacation from mess duty. \" Then Orilley got very serious and slid the card back in his pocket. He glanced over his shoulders for prying ears and leaned in close. \" You wana die here M? \" He asked. Mecial could n't answer immediately, afraid the conversation was heading down a one way street, as it usually had with Orilley. \" No more than the next person O. \" He finally answered then Orilley shot up. \" On that moon down there is a way to get back to Earth. \" He said, pointing his finger to the glass. \" Now I know. I know \" He reaffirmed \" that I can get us down there with this clearance and get us on one of those ships Mecial. I can smuggle us to Earth on one of those leave transports, where we belong. But the Sparrows I got clearance for take two pilots and I can't do it alone. \" It was silent for what seemed to be an eternity. He knew Orilley was a capable of doing what he suggested and a part of him knew that this wasn't the first time he had through about this. Abandoning the colony meant death and they both knew it. Mecial looked at Orilley who waited expectantly, then back towards Aries. The lights glistened calmly. He thought about the feeling of dirt between his toes and orange groves and clouds. He thought about being able to touch waterfowl and swim in real, natural water. He clutched his fists and faced Orilley. \" What do you need me to do? \" He asked.

Ironically, the remains are of Algor who pens a letter to their successors. The letter is written in a language deciphered in three months. The humans think it is a joke, but they find hundreds of the bones, then thousands, then millions. The joke is either elaborate or not a joke at all. The bones of Algor are used to clone him. They are terrified of the huge dinosaur, but they speak to him using his language, and the dinosaur looks at them with sadness. \" We destroyed ourselves then?\" The human in charge, says with a tear in his eye, \" Yes, I'm afraid so.\" \" May I live here?\" \" Yes.\" \" Can more of my kind be cloned?\" \" Yes.\" And it is so, but humanity lives in harmony with dinosaur-kind.

When he was selected for jury duty he rationalised it as an opportunity to become more forensically aware. Being here, however, seeing the people and the seriousness of all involved. It amused him. He could n't say why. Then again, he was the type to laugh at a funeral, so Dan figured his reaction was not atypical for sorts such as him. As they brought in the accused, he appeared broken to Dan. The court guards took off the restraints his counsel shook his hand and muttered something in his ear. The prosecution, sat at a table loaded with legal folders few feet away to his left appeared predatory. They smelled blood and were in for the kill. Dan's impression of murderers to that point was much like himself. This man, Kane Ellison, was pathetic. He seemed highly medicated. A shame. Dan felt he would learn nothing and his valuable skills and time would be wasted on a trial that would be intent on sifting through minute evidence in order to prove this shuddering fool was a killer. He'd probably offed his wife for an affair. All emotion, no planning and completely bungled. Dan thought at least he would have a good time watching the police interviews as the man lied, fell over said lie and gradually built himself a prison of incriminating bullshit. As the prosecution, a tall blonde in an off the rack suit, stood to give her opening speech, Dan fantasised about getting out of jury duty. There was valuable work to be done, just this morning he'd seen a six figure contract. That could finance the next few months in Vegas... the store-bought prosector said something and switched on the wall screen and the gruesome picture made Dan's head swim with the translocation of memory and time like when you pass a electronics store and reaslie you're on TV. Talsim fought hard. He died eventually, but that was a stipulation of the contract. Bleed him out. SLOWLY. Dan unconsciously muttered \" Talsim!\" and his thoughts froze as he felt sure the whole room could read his mind at that point and his utterance would be seen as irrefutable guilt. Only the juror next to him seemed to notice. An elderly lady that smelled like soup looked around and put her finger to her lips. Dan slowly turned his head to view the gallery. Nonchalance was the aim, though Dan did n't feel it. Three rows back, second seat from the aisle. A detective-looking man was staring at him. No. Staring and frowning. The man pulled up a notebook and scribbled something \" Juror 12, Daniel guilty James, did it\" His semi-panicked mind suggested. Dan smiled and continued his sweep of the room but felt the man's stare linger beyond etiquette, beyond homosexual attraction, beyond doubt. He would die today. Overweight, cheeks reddened from frequent alchohol or high blood pressure? Heart attack. Stun and then inject into a mole. The defense was up and talking and had been for some time because he the gesticulating angry black lawyer was winding down to the fact that we, the jury would have sufficient reasonable doubt to find pale-and-shaking not-guilty. Dan disagreed. He found Kane guilty by reason of incredible personal convenience. Following the break for lunch, the Judge entered and declared the court was adjourned for the day due to a man having a heart attack in the bathroom. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Hope medical centre. Dan said to soup-lady that he'd noticed the man who'd had a heart attack in the gallery. Soup-lady turned and put her finger to her lips and turned to face the judge. Dan envisaged kicking her legs from under her and forcing her face into the wooden railing. He wondered if the odour of her decomposing corpse would mask the soup smell. As he sat there he unfurled a piece of paper torn from the detective's notepad as he left the bathroom and read its contents. It read \" Juror 1 nice boobs, Juror 6 appears to be a galloping racist, flinches at defence laywer, Juror 12, looks like that guy from Party of Five...\" below that was a to-do list.'get the Cambridge Park pollution piece to editor by close of play 17th'. Dan had killed a man for nothing. He felt sick. Not for the reasons a normal person would. But for the fact that there was no profit and complete personal risk. Every kill has its risks. They could scratch, tear clothing, blood spatter, DNA etc... The more you kill, the more likely more resources would be thrown into finding the answers. If some FBI profiler gets a hard-on and draws threads between those kills then its automatic task force level attention. Actually, Dan thought, he could n't think of an operator who'd escaped a task force. He knew because he'd taken the contracts to silence the ones who give evidence against his employers. Rule 1: dont bite the hand that feeds you. Dan's thoughts were broken by the soup lady looking angrily at him. \" Would you mind taking this a tad more seriously?\" She said. Dan put his finger to his lips. His other hand showed her his middle finger.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Ever since then, groups of people have been trying to kidnap me, saying it was for my protection or saying that I owed it to the humans to be a weapon, to wipe out the monster threat. But, conveniently, monsters always appeared at those times and attacked the humans. I always survived, but no one else ever did. I made sure of that. What can I do? How do I always survive?

Which is ironic of you see my thin frame, I by no means look strong whatsoever. But I also do n't look like a twig. Anyways, I'm twenty-four now. It was a Tuesday when I heard a knock on my door. I walked to my door and opened it to see two men in suits, one short and one tall, standing at my door. \" Hello, what can I do for you?\" I asked the men. \" Mr. Williams?\" The tall one asked. \" Yes? What can I do for you gentlemen?\" I asked. \" You need to come with us.\" Said the short man, \" Says who?\" The men pulled out badges, \" Your government needs you.\" I snatched the badges and read FBI on their cards. \" What's in it for me?\" The short one twitched, \" You're required to serve your country.\" \" Well, you see, I can rip you and your friend apart, go back to my breakfast, and say you never made it here. So what's stopping me?\" The tall one pointed over his shoulder with his thumb. \" That's our ride, it's also streaming to our headquarters so if anything happens to us, we'll have a team here to take you down.\" \" Good luck with that.\" I laughed at them. \" Although, given my past experiences with people trying to recruit me, I'd say you have about two minutes before some bad, scary monsters come and eat you up.\" The men exchanged glances with each other. \" Look,\" I interrupted their looks, \" whatever it is, you can just nuke it, I'm done here.\" I closed the door in their faces. I walked back over to my table and sat down. My door splintered off its hinges and armed SWAT poured into my living room. \" Can I help you?\" I asked them. The two agents stepped through the SWAT operatives. \" You need to come with us.\" \" You have thirty seconds.\" I said glancing down at my watch. \" Are you threatening us?\" The short one had a vein pop out on his forehead. \" No, I'm trying to help you.\" \" Sounded like a threat to me.\" \" Go to hell.\" He turned to his agents, \" Take him down.\" Now, during this encounter, I was focusing on changing my shape. When the agents stepped towards me, I shifted. I grew to a height of fourteen feet tall. My skin sprouted, black, shaggy fur. Horns grew from my head and claws sprouted. Gunfire filled the room. My fur was bulletproof, fun fact. The bullets had no effect. I roared at the men. They stepped back and took out batons, prepared to beat me into submission I imagine. Before I had to do anything, three monsters came through my door. One was a cyclops looking thing, one resembled a werewolf, and one was a horned, skinless creature. They leaped into the fray and went to work. The SWAT team was thrown into chaos. They shot at the new monsters, the cyclops was on the ground, bullets riddled its body. The werewolf-esque monster tore through the SWAT members, making its way towards me. I plucked the two agents from the FBI out of the fighting and set them behind me. \" Shut up and do n't move.\" I told them in a deep, gruff voice. The werewolf pounced at me. I grabbed it by the jaw and forced its maw wider and wider. It cracked but I kept opening the jaws until it's lower jaw was ripped straight off. I tossed the thing aside and stared at the skinless thing. It lunged at me, I caught it with my large hands. I picked it up and threw against the living room, slamming into the wall. The wall collapsed on impact and the thing went sprawling into the street, destroying the SWAT vehicle. The few remaining SWAT tried to escape from the carnage, slipping on blood as they ran, only to be attacked by a fourth monster. It was a winged creature. It swooped down upon the men. It slashed one up with its claws and grabbed another, flying high into the air and dropping him. Then diving back down to the other men to repeat the process. \" You should have left.\" I grumbled to the agents and stepped outside. The winged beast shrieked at my appearance and dove towards me. I swung a fist towards the winged beast, it fell out of the sky, a wing bent at an awkward angle. The skinless creature let loose a cry of frustration as it lunged towards me again. I swung my claws as they sank deep into the things muscle. Blood poured from the wounds. It let loose a scream and swiped with its claws. I stepped back as the claws sliced through some of my fur, narrowly avoiding my flesh. The winged thing pounced at me, I lowered my head and let the thing's own weight impale itself on my horns. I flung the dead beast off and approached the last monster. Before I could attack the thing. It kneeled over, a glowing light protruded from its back. The sky went dark. I looked up and saw... a ship. \" What is that?\" I asked. \" That...\" squeaked the short agent, \" is the problem.\" A sudden beam of light flashed from the ship, landing down the street. I could smell the things from here. They stank of rotting flesh and... and snake. They smelled like reptiles. I watched them approach. A group of four strong were approaching. They were tall, about seven feet. They appeared thick and sturdy but somehow humanoid. When they were about five yards away, they stopped. I reverted back to my human shape, still concentrating on my other shape, and walked closer. \" What are you doing here?\" I asked them. I did n't know what else to say, I always liked getting straight to point. Through a very thick, unrecognizable accent, they answered. \" We have been looking for someone as powerful as you. Come with us.\" I glanced back go the agents. \" Hell no.\" I responded. The aliens glanced at each other and then the closest one responded. \" We will force you if you do not comply.\" \" Try it.\" I smiled and opened my arms. Instantly the three aliens shed their skin. Their pale flesh fell away to reveal green, scaled skin. They were bipedal, their mouths were filled with needle like teeth, long and sharp. They did n't have claws, but they did only have four fingers, which was strange to me. I shifted back to my father's shape. I smiled at the aliens and bared my sharp teeth. The foremost one lunged at me. It jumped twenty feet into the air. It kept fell towards me, but in the air it could n't change its course. I jumped up and impaled the alien with my horns. It twitched and did n't move again. I flung it off my horns and ran towards the other three. They all jumped. I snatched one put of the air and bit into it. Blood poured from the alien. I savored it. I grabbed another one and threw it into the closest building. The last one landed on my shoulder and climbed onto my back. I fell back onto my back, hoping to crush the thing. No such luck. It scrambled to my chest and bit into my throat. Its tiny needle like teeth dug into my flesh. I felt it inject something and my dorm began to slowly loose shape, back to my human form. I heard gunshots and the alien fell off me. But the damage was done, I was back in my human form. I glanced over to see the short agent with his gun pointed at the alien. The alien stood, blood leaking from its shoulder. It waved it's hand and a beam of light appeared in its hand. It pulled its arm back and threw the light. The beam impaled the short agent, blood slicked the street. The tall agent screamed. He unloaded his clip at the reptilian creature but it dodged each bullet with grace. It threw another beam of light which impaled the tall agent through the chest. He went flying backwards about twenty feet and the light impaled the asphalt, suspending him above the ground. The alien looked at me and flashed its teeth. I ran towards it. It looked amused by what must have seemed like a feeble attempt to fight back. It gave what I guess was a smile but it looked like a sneer. I swung a fist at it and connected with it in the chest. The thing collapsed from my punch. I quickly grasped its ankle spun. It slowly approached an electrical pole. The thing's jaw hit the pole, smashing its face flat. You could hear the crunching of its face, the snapping of its neck. The wooden pole was now splintered where its face collided with it. The alien went limp and I threw it across into the remnants of my house. I was used to humans and monsters, but aliens were new. It was time to move. I walked back to my house to pack my bags.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

In order to help us, they have started a charity drive on their planet.", "output": "Earth: A paradise of water, oxygen, and plentiful life. One of the rare planets to evolve intelligence, its inhabitants are nonetheless primitive, poor, and in need of your help. For mere fractions of a credit per second, you can sponsor one of the native Earthlings, who refer to themselves as \" humans\". These humans, while not yet fully self-aware, still live rich inner lives full of joy and love, yet also pain and fear. Their tribal evolutionary upbringing has lead to many cognitive shortcuts and biases that, tragically, prevent them from uplifting themselves to true sentience or even cooperating among themselves in significant numbers. We can not change the humans without fundamentally altering who they consider themselves to be, but we can ease their suffering. When you agree to sponsor one of these poor creatures, you're agreeing to increase that being's quality of living, and the planet's quality as a whole. What's more, for every time their planet circles its parent star, you will receive at least ten missives from your adopted human. Here is one such example: > Dear Xxarvix, > I guess you're my mom now? Or Dad? I'm not really clear on your gender ( s ) and it might be both. Anyway, I'm writing to thank you for the zero-point energy generator you sent me. My husband may not appreciate it because he thinks it means there's a \" black hole in the house\", but I know better. > Just to be clear, there's no black hole in my house, right? > I've been using it to power my house and electronics, and selling some of the energy back to the grid. The power station people were awfully mad because apparently I've rendered them completely obsolete? Their scientists were pretty mad too, claiming I'd broken a bunch of physics laws, but the physics police have n't shown up yet so I'm not too worried. > In conclusion, thanks for the stuff, and also thanks for not enslaving humanity. You, too, could have your own sponsored human. Their devotion is unparalleled, and their constant inability to re-examine ( or often, examine in the first place ) their own beliefs is charmingly quaint when it is n't leading to the wholesale destruction of their species.

Nothing was done exclusively for her. A tall, pale man in a military coat and sunglasses appeared on the floorboards in front of her. He said in the deep, raspy voice of a lifelong cigarette smoker \" Okay, okay. Curb your enthusiasm, kid.\" Jen remained silent \" Let me explain this to ya.\" \" Explain what?\" she managed to finally eek out, a single tear rolling down her acne-covered cheek. She hated to cry out of fear. It made her feel weak, like she should be able to simply choose not to cry. She quickly wiped it away with a shaking hand. \" Explain\" The strange man said, sitting down cross-legged on the floor in front of her seat \" what makes today the best day you'll ever have on this planet.\" She gave him a quizzical look \" You see, kid, this truck,\" he explained, gesturing to the semi that hung mere inches from her window, \"... this truck, well... um, jeeze, this does n't get any easier the more I do it. You're going to die... today... NOW.\" \" What!?\" Jen shouted, covering her face and sobbing into her palms. \" Jennifer Ruby O'Reardon, this truck will kill you. It will be relatively painless.

So, you choose someone and instead of letting you die, I let them die.\" The girl looked at him in silent terror. He explained further \" For example, if you choose... um... your mom, all you have to do is touch her and then she gets killed by this truck and you are n't hurt at all. Sound fair?\" Jen tapped a finger to her chin in concentration and muttered faintly \" Well, if I pick Alex, mom and dad will never be the same again. I'll have to live with them always talking about how great he always was and how he probably would have accomplished more than me when he was alive. Same goes for Michael. If I kill him, it's all mourning all the time and everything's about the innocence of childhood and how they were taken before their time.

This is an important decision.\" \" Why are you doing this to me? What did I do to have to make this choice!?\" \" I've been taking life from anything that had it since before time began.

That I'm cruel and take the lives of innocent people unfairly and 2. That I wreak havoc mainly on very young children. I knew it would make no difference, but I decided then and there that any time someone who is a child at heart is in mortal danger, I will give them a choice before taking a life, as the person whose life it is makes no real difference to me. So now, Jennifer O'Reardon, after 14 years, 2 months, and 11 days on this harsh planet, I'm afraid to say that it's your turn to make the choice.

I knew that the disease had riddled my bones with so much ugliness, I'd never be comfortable. I was all set to end the pain. I was going to until Dr. Emil Raminth offered me another option. He told me I could be on a new body, a healthy body, and it would cost nothing because every doctor in the country would pitch in to help. My name is Greg Clift. I'm 5'11\", very pale, and very underweight from the disease. before it struck, I was average: cushioning around the middle, slightly tanned, nice hair cut into the hip new undercut. I could laugh at how I thought that mattered. I could no longer work, my insurance plan was great, but it could n't get me into a drug trial. There was n't even a trial to try. I was 2 weeks from my scheduled departure from the pain when Dr. Raminth showed up at my door. -- --'Good night, Becky'I said to my sister as I went under anesthesia and into the operating room. I told them I did n't care what the person looked like, only that they be sort of near my old skin color and -- I laughed as I said this -- a little taller would be nice. -- -- I tried to open my eyes. I thought I did. I was n't sure I knew how to do that. I just kept thinking of my eyes until light flooded in. It was white light with hints of blue and black and orange, seemingly really far away. I tried to look left and right, but I felt my eyes rolling which ever way they wanted to, not even together. I heard Dr. Raminth's voice, but could n't understand him. Suddenly, a bright green light flooded my vision. It almost burned. When it turned off, my eyes were looking straight up, and I could move them. I looked around. Becky was in the corner, all dressed up in medical gear. I thought I smiled at her, but I might have just vomited on myself. I had to find the connection to this new body. I thought of my right hand, my writing hand, my dominant hand, though I wondered if the body dictated that. *Maybe I should try left* I chuckled to myself. I just thought of the sensation of playing my saxophone, moving my fingers. *Focus* *Keep trying* *Focus*. I felt my hand come into consciousness and suddenly I screamed as my entire body flooded with sensations. Burns and pinpricks and cuts all over, like a toothache in every ounce of my body. It felt like the worseness of my disease had followed me. I screamed and writhed. I finally understood Dr. Raminth,'Greg, you need to tell your brain your body does n't hurt anymore. Focus on my fingers touching your stomach.'I tried to focus, and slowly, the fire in my body faded to nothing. I moved my arm around, it flopping like a fish out of water. I flipped it up to where my neck joined my torso and it was covered with gauze. I moved it to my lips and rested it there while I tried to speak. Eventually, it moved, and sound came out and -- -- When I came to again, I was laying slightly up from parallel and could move my whole body. Becky came right over when she saw my eyes open,'Greg! Greg! The doctor knocked you out and jumpstarted your nervous system. You're fine! Move, talk, laugh! All I could muster to say was'Did you bring my saxophone?'She laughed and told me she could have her husband bring it tomorrow. I pushed myself up and then looked at my arms. They were so beautiful: muscular, white, with rich, hairy forearms. My biceps were huge. I pulled my gown off and saw that below the gauze around my neck were two amazing pecs with quarter sized nipples. Farther down, 8 perfectly crafted abs lay flanked by many lines of obliques on either side. I kept following my eyes down until I saw the most glorious, girthy, intact penis I'd ever seen, sitting on top of the right amount of pubic hair. Becky was staring too. I looked at her and we laughed and I finished looking down at the hairy, sculpted legs. I was hot. I got a hot body. I have a body most people would kill for. It was then that Dr. Raminth came in to give me the report on how I got this body. He told me that he killed this man and, as he did so, the police swarmed in and arrested him. -- -- I kept my body perfect: I ate great, I went to the gym, I had phenomenal sex, I was the envy of everyone at the lakefront. It's a shame that the body also makes me kill. Every Tuesday, I drove out of state, found some hot body on the street, invited them into my car, and then the body choked the life out of them and then fucked their dead body. One day, I asked the body why we had to do this. My arm reached up and grabbed the mirror in my car, and adjusted it so I could see myself. I looked into my own eyes and deep, deep inside them I saw it: the loathing, the rage, the hatred, the aggression. I laughed. I was so happy I could finally let that all out.

I dropped my trousers and jacked off into the vat like I always do. -- --'Greg, it's you, is n't it.

Texas Hold'em was their game of choice, though sometimes they demanded we play monopoly. Do n't ask me how, and please do n't ask why- instead just be content with the knowledge that some of them do look and act like Robin Williams. I also suspect one of them might have actually been Shaquille O'Neal. Regardless of the circumstances that lead me to be an honorary member of that table, or the consequences that seemed to impact my life in an endless string of oddities before finally stepping away and leaving the games behind: I can tell you that I've won some pretty weird shit. In my Studio Apartment, I've got a toaster that pops out grilled cheese sandwiches- prebuttered and crisped to perfection. In my bathroom I have plunger than can do the work itself, and I've got one of those magic carpets- only it's too lazy to move most days. I even have a pet tabby cat that can talk, or at least speak on occasion, when it wants to. Honestly, there are probably some other weird trinkets I'm forgetting about. Bizarre objects I've piled high up in the back of my closet, stuffed deep with all sorts of other mystic mumbo-jumbo and bits of heeby-jeeby witchcraft, but out of my entire collection there is only one possession that truly makes a difference to me. Out of everything I have ever come into contact with, won, lost, or bartered among magic folk and almost all-seeing entities: My car is the crown Jewel. The representative *Magnum Opus* of my past gambling career. When I first got it, this baby was a metallic green. Legacy station wagon, Subaru 97'hatchback. Mint condition, slightly used by a Genie from the north country who put it up against fifteen gold bars and a bag of magic sand that was supposedly capable of making you seed the universe if you happened to have the cajones to snort some of it under a solar eclipse. For all the mysticism in the world, there were only two magic words sealed the deal for me that day, ensuring that I would be driving in style for years to come: *Full-House. * Next thing I knew, I was the proud owner of a Genie's automobile. Rare and almost unheard of for a mere mortal, I even left on good terms too ( which is very important when dealing with Genies ) and I passed him off the bag of sand when we shook on it. No point in pissing off someone who could turn me into a talking parrot named Iago. But see, there was a trick to the car. It was n't always a 97 hatchback: No sir, this vehicle was all-purpose, all-seeing, future predicting and filled with the powerful energy of some far-off and distant parallel plane of existence. It could change, shift to accommodate the day ahead of me. If it was snowing? Poof: Snow-tires, top tier. If it was flooding? Snap of the fingers and my car was a four by four, but there were some days when it changed without me even noticing. When I had a date it turned into a corvette, and when she broke up with me it turned into a small moped I could hide in my apartment until we were sure she was n't coming to give us the ex-girlfriend special. One time it even changed into a crown-vic when I was toggling the radio stations and got me past a speed trap ticket free. Safe to say that unlike the magic toaster or the talking tabby, my car and I had an real understanding. Only the finest oil changes would do, only top-notch gasoline, routine inspections and transmission flushes- and in return I knew it would have my back through anything. Well this Saturday morning I went outside after a brunch of grilled cheese and coffee, same as any Saturday morning, only instead of my normal car I found a metallic green tank parked right up onto the curb. A huge, thick treaded, armor and cannon-mounted, possibly German engineered, war-machine. \" Hey, Human.\" Startled, I almost dropped my sandwich. As many things as it could do, my car could n't talk. \" Hey, up here.\" The voice shouted again. From the second floor window of my apartment, I turned and peered up, focusing my attention on the window sill home to several potted plants and a large patch of... fur. I squinted to see the orange tabby sitting coolly by the screen, eyes all-but shut against the early afternoon light, passing a half-interested glare in my direction. \" If you happen to make it back alive human, do n't forget to bring back some tuna.\" With that warning the tank's hatch opened, a loud creaking \" slam\" announcing entry was strongly recommended. Somehow I knew it was going to be one hell of a day. -- -- *If you like what you're reading, feel free to check out my other work over at r/jakethesnakebakecake* *! * *edit: magnum not magna! *", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Aoi hugged him, staining Ao's shirt with tears. \" I think I've given up love, to save the one I love. It's a fair trade, do n't you think?\" Ao said, resting his chin on Aoi's head.

{"input": "The remains of the human race live in a glass dome with no entrance or exit which protects them from the wasteland on the outside, one morning a dusty hand print appears on the outside", "output": "\" Everyone stand back! STAND BACK I SAY!\" yelled the Mayor, over the cries and voices of a hundred people. The sound would echo back in a deafening tone, from the top of the glass dome. Women were covering their children's ears. Men were scrambling to the front of the crowd. The Mayor stood there, his eyes widened at the fear in his people's eyes. He knew he had to control the crowd, but how? The Mayor then reached into his pocket, and pulled out a walkie-talkie like device, except something was attached to the antennae. An almost foil-like sheet, spreading out like a sail in front of the Mayor's face. He pushed three blue buttons on top of the device, then put it back into his pocket, folding the foil-like sheet. He breathed a sigh of relief, but in his heart, he knew his people would not take lightly to this. The Mayor waited and waited, holding back the crowd of people scrambling to see what was on the glass dome. Sweat was dripping down his face, onto his suit from his fedora. One child cried out from the crowd, \" They're here! It's a sign!\" Another man called out, \" Well, it must've been that damn Henry Wooten. Such a criminal, escaping. He's out there. I know it!\" A women cried out, \" Were the stories true? My great-grandfather used to say-\" Behind the crowd, across the intersection, flashing lights were approaching. The lights became more and more visible. Most the crowd turned around, squinting at what it may be. Suddenly, a faint horn could be heard. The crowd gasped, knowing what was coming. Some ran over to the sidewalk. Some still pursued the glass. The women took their children back inside, looking through their window worriedly. As the sound became more and more prominent, the Mayor walked out past the crowd, and ran over to the middle of the intersection. The car approached. The car, painted red and black, read, \" New London\" across the doors. The siren on the top stopped, and the crowd finally calmed. The mayor waved at the car, and the figure inside waved back. The mayor ran back over to the glass dome, and got on top of a wooden box sitting by a fire hydrant, and stood on top, standing over the crowd. \" Thank you, my fellow citizens, for calming yourselves. The situation is under control, and will be investigated. Please go back to your daily activities. There's a rugby game going on over in Treadwell. A big important game. In fact, I'm sad i'm missing it.\" The Mayor laughed to himself, and so did some of the crowd, but the crowd still looked disappointed. After the crowd had thinned out, back to their streets and houses, the figure in the car stepped out. Out came a middle-aged man, no younger than 35. He had a leather jacket over his broad shoulders and built chest. He wore an English driving cap, and a cigar hung out his mouth. He walked over to the Mayor. \" Mister Mayor, nice to see you again.\" The man stretched out his large hand, smirking at the Mayor over his cigar. The mayor shrugged at the man, and said, \" This is no time for greetings, Timothy. You know who I am, and I know who you are. We have a serious matter on our hands.\" Timothy looked at the Mayor suspiciously, but just nodded. \" I know. I got the message while I was down at Lake Bydo. It's a Sunday, and I'm still getting calls. I must be very good.\" Timothy let out a huge grin, but the Mayor was just rolling his eyes. \" I know, Timothy. I know. In fact, you're the best detective around. Not that there's many... but that's not important. Come with me.\" The Mayor directed Timothy around a corner, and to the glass dome. Printed there, not too high off the ground, was a dusty hand print. The hand print was beginning to fade due to the high winds outside, but it was still prominent enough to catch Timothy's attention. He bent down, and his eyes seemed to scan the hand print. He looked up at the Mayor, his eyes beaming with fear and excitement. \" Not since-\" \" The Escape, I know.\" muttered The Mayor. Timothy bent there for a while, his eyes scanning over the whole hand print. He looked for any abnormalities, anything to give him a lead. He then bent up, brushed off his leather jacket, and looked straight into the Mayor's eyes. \" The hand print looks completely normal. Only one difference: the thumb is too long for an average human's hand. The average thumb length of a human is about 2.5 inches. This one is about 6 inches. Unless we got Mister Big Thumb on the run, this is n't human.\" The Mayor just stood there, his mouth dried up, and he stared at the ground. \" *No... *\" he thought. \" *This is n't true... humans are the only animal left... no. *\" He recollected his thoughts, and looked back at Timothy. \" Well, what is it?\" he said sharply. \" That's the problem, I do n't know.\" he said in a reassuring tone to The Mayor, whose eyes still showed fear. Timothy walked over to the wall, and leaned on it. He got lost in thought. The Mayor followed him, staring at him, waiting for an answer. The silence was broken by something walking over to them. It was a young child, trotting down the sidewalk. It came to be a young girl, her blonde hair in a ponytail, and her red dress hitting the ground. She was holding book titled, \" Stories During The War\" \" Hello!\" said Timothy to the young girl. The young girl stopped, and looked at him. She smiled back, but stayed quiet. \" What book you have there?\" The young girl gave him the book. Timothy looked at the cover, laughed to himself, then opened it up to the first chapter, \" *Chapter 1: The Skaars*\" Timothy, after skimming through it, came to a picture. His eyes exploded with reason at the sight of the picture. He almost dropped the book due to his eureka. He quickly turned the page, and came to a paragraph that read: \" *The Skaars were a group of guerilla fighters from the old country of South Africa. They fought against the opposition of the reign of King Gecko from France, operating separate from the Spanish Opposition. Nobody knows what happened to this group, as they were left behind before the Obese was dropped. *\" He looked back at the picture, and saw three men standing behind a burning building. The three men were holding modern weapons. Timothy was speechless for a minute, before showing The Mayor the photo. \" Mayor... look at this photo...\" he whispered to The Mayor. The young girl stood there, clueless. \" Yes. The Skaars. They were killed off. But that's just a legend.\" said the Mayor. \" No, what looks off about the photo?\" said Timothy, holding the photo up close to the Mayor. \" It's just three men...\" the Mayor said, scoffing. \" Look at their hands.\" Timothy pointed to the third man from the right's hand. \" His hand looks a bit large... wait..\" The Mayor's eyes widened. His fedora almost fell off his head. \" The thumb... the thumb... it's large.\" the Mayor whispered. \" Pretty large... pretty large...\" Timothy looked behind him out past the glass dome. It was a wasteland. Nothing bust dust and junk. \" What does this mean?\" said the Mayor. \" Well, either we have a prankster on our hands, or those stories are true.\" Timothy said. Edit: I changed the country where the Skaars were from from Spain to South Africa, because I found out Skaars is a Afrikaans word meaning scarce.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The black guy ALWAYS dies first! Trust me! \" Jim pulled his chair closer to the television, wrenching it across vintage red shag-like material performing its best impression of a carpet. Plopping himself back onto the chair, he leaned forward towards the television. \" If you love her, \" he said in a hushed, low voice, \" you'll let her go. Run away from her! Now! Before it's too late! \" \" You're crazy man! \" the African American man, named Spike, hollered back, breathing heavily at the same time. Twigs and leaves crackled underfoot as the pair continued running through the forest with the director's choice of visual cuts produced the appearance of aimless running. Both Spike and his lover, Katrina, through the most absurd set of circumstances that had ever occurred in made-for-TV films history had SOMEHOW become separated from the rest of their group. Jim worked the cash register in aisles 4 and 9 at Walmart. Occasionally, when the store wasn't busy, he'd stock shelves. He wasn't a particularly smart dude, but even he couldn't fathom as to how they'd gotten lost. \" And racist! This is 21st Century America! That's the most tasteless thing I've ever heard! \" Spike, unawares of where this mysterious god-like voice had come from, was yelling at the sky as he ran. To his credit, Jim thought, he'd find it kind of suspicious too If he started hearing voices from the sky. Still. He had to try and save them. Every life was sacred in his eyes; even imaginary ones. \" I know, I know and I'm sorry! \" Jim sat back in his chair, having taken a moment to grab the bowl of popcorn he'd set down on his side table. \" But, Hollywood's still stuck in the past! They're remaking Ghostbusters! We can't even get past the eighties! You need to get away from her, immediately! \" Spike slowed down and turned to Katrina. His body made a quick three sixty, glancing around the area for signs of their pursuer. The coast was clear, for now. \" Listen. \" he said sternly, taking Katrina's hands into his own then gazing deeply into her light green emerald eyes \" I love you. With all my heart and all my soul. I promised not to leave you. \" In this moment, his beloved was absolutely radiant. Moonlight that weaved through the trees lended a luminous, firefly glow to the irises he would miss. He softy ran his fingers through her long, silky brown hair, admiring his wife the way only a man of chivalry could. Jim leaned in, silently munching his popcorn. \" But, the voice is right. You'll have a better chance if I draw it away when it comes. \" \" Oh Spike \" she moaned. \" Oh Katrina. \" he breathed. Their lips met, the scene draped by a sad longing only moonlight curtains and silent orchestras can bring. Jim could feel a tear coming on. He had to get both of them out. It didn't matter if one of them was black, he would figure out a way. As the lovers stood, locked in their warm embrace, Jim whipped out his smartphone and googled the film title, \" The Return II: Return of the Returned \" Scrolling down to the plot, he scanned just a little bit past towards the point in the plot they were at, only to drop the smartphone and look up at the screen. \" No, no, no! Stop! Get out! Run! STOP! \" \" What? \" Spike inquired, his head turning in the particular direction the camera was placed. As if on cue, and believe me, it was totally on cue, a sudden, sharp squishing noise was heard. Jim buried his face into his hands. Onscreen, Spike and Katrina looked down to find themselves run through by a long-steel spear. The pair screamed in abject horror, the camera panning away to the treetops above. Thick branches and heavy leaves made up the canopy, but even then, it barely served to muffle the screams of the slaughter below. \" No, no, no, no, no. \" Jim said to himself. \" Who said that? \" Jim looked up. The scene had cut away to the rest of the group Katrina and Spike had been separated from. \" Huh? \" Jim muttered. \" Where'd that come from? \" With the kind of casual resignation that naturally comes to a cashier, he stood up, walked towards his TV, and pressed the power button.

At first I could n't believe it, but then she made not only a sword and shield, but an entire suit of armor as well! Then she beet up some of the bulies at the playground, and they had to be taken to the hospital. 10-22-30 I did n't see Sarya at school today. Gregory told me that she was \" suss-pen-dead\" because she beat up the bullies. I was sad. Mrs. Smith was also gone today. 10-23-30 Today the teacher came back. And I was happy! We did n't have any homework today, which is GREAT! The teacher also taught us about something called \" Toh-poe-grah-fick-pow-urs\" and said that where you were born can give some people incredibel powers, and showed us her power. She could break would without even touching it and move it with her mind. It was awsum! 10-24-30 Mommy did n't bring me to school today, and she said I would n't go back for a while. She told me that I was born in outer space. I was so confused. People ca n't be born in space, it's impossible, the cold would kill you. I am mad at her today. 10-25-30 I am at home again. Mommy says that I have to stay home for a little bit longer until she knows what to do. I miss Sarya. I miss Mrs. Smith. They are cool. May the Fourth, Twenty Fourty-Eight: Almost eighteen years have past since my transfer of study as a child. Tears come to my eyes when I read on my interpretation of events I wish I had no knowledge of. The innocence of my youth was slowly drained after the awareness of my origins. Origins define everything for humans now. Sarya was born in Egypt, so she could control each grain of sand in her reach. Mrs. Smith was born in the wilderness of England, away from the chaos of the busy city. She could control the bark of trees and wood. But I was different from the rest. I was born in the vacuum of space on the ISS. My surroundings were void, so my abilities should be void, right? That was never the case. Space is a vacuum of the collisions of everything. Space is where life could exist for three seconds or three eternities. Space is where everything is visible but never in your reach. And so I became a God among men. My mother homeschooled me from the very day Mrs. Smith showed us the potential of Topographic Powers. My mother was afraid I would become encouraged and eventually try to use mine. She was terrified for my sake, all the other parents were too. So she limited my interactions with the outside world. Giving me curfew, homeschooling me with Father. They were very dedicated and educated. They spend hours training my abilities to do amazing things. Today is the day I can go out and see the world. I'm leaving for Cairo to help with the relief. Sarya will be there too, I know it. My entire life has been build around love, my entire training has been build around love. Everything from here on out has to be for the unconditional love for and best intentions of people. I'm leaving this book here as a keepsake for mother, father, and brother Hikaru. May you all hold the message of love in your hearts. Love is what guides us, and compassion is our destiny.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Check in a few late night stragglers, drink coffee, watch Netflix, surf reddit, do a little paperwork; it was a sweet gig. Now? Now I wonder why I stay. I lean back in my chair my hand on pistol, watching the security cameras intently. Some nights are dead. Just me with my eyes twitching between feeds like a crackhead. Other nights, this place is a war zone. The wall across the lobby is littered with bullet holes. What can I say? It's hard to shoot straight when you're diving for cover. I'm glad they bullet proofed the desk. No one ever comes to the hotel to kill me. That I know of. It's the guests they're after. Honestly, it does n't effect me either way if they kill the guests. They have n't added, \" Make sure no one kills the guests\" to my job description. Not everyone realizes this. For some reason they assume I care and will try to stop them. They obviously are n't familiar with very many Night Auditors. The phone rings, giving me a start. I sit up and sigh, taking a moment to collect myself before I answer. I see from the dash the call is coming from inside the hotel. \" Guest services?\" \" Hi, we're in room 249 and the room above us is making all kinds of noise.\" I wanted to suggest that the woman simply kill the guest in the room above her, but while killing people was legal at night, advocating for killing people was n't. \" I apologize ma'am. I'll look into it,\" I told her. I hung up and took a moment to clean my glasses and straighten my shirt and tie before I locked the front door and put a'back in 5'sign on the desk. The elevator took me to the third floor while cheerfully playing Muzak. As the doors slowly opened, I took another deep breath and surveyed the hall. All seemed quiet so far. As I neared room 349, this did not remain the case. I heard a heavy thudding sound coming from the room, along with some muffled cries. I drew my gun and steeled myself for whatever I might encounter, and knocked sharply on the door. The thudding stopped, but the muffled crying did not. The door swung open and a blood splattered man stood there holding an equally bloody baseball bat, in his underwear, staring at me quizzically. \" Is there a problem?\" I looked past him at a bloodied and whimpering figure on the floor in front of the television. \" I just wanted to inform you, sir, that we've received a noise complaint about your room.\" \" Oh, I'm so sorry. I did n't realize I was being that loud.\" \" It's alright, sir, just keep in mind that our quiet hours are between 11 pm and 7 am. I should also note that the hotel has a zero tolerance policy and if I receive another noise complaint, unfortunately I will have to evict you.\" \" Of course,\" the man told me, wiping the blood from his face with a towel that I noted fortunately did not belong to the hotel. \" Sorry about that. It wo n't happen again. Say, do you have the time?\" \" It's nearly four, sir. You'll want to hurry it up.\" \" Thanks, goodnight.\" I gave him a nod and wished him goodnight as well and returned to the lobby. At the desk stood a very angry looking man in a suit. \" Do you have any idea how long I've been standing here?\" He asked me angrily. \" I'm sorry sir, I was just-.\" \" I do n't care. I have a reservation for today. I'm checking in.\" The annoyance at being interrupted was starting to bubble into something else. \" Sir, our check in time is 3 PM, not 3 AM.\" \" I'm a Titanium member. I get free early check ins. I also want two free waters and the check in gift bag.\" I sighed and questioned why I kept this job when I could go work somewhere else and not have to deal with asshats like this guy, but whatever. In the meantime, this is my life. I turned to go get the waters when I heard the sharp sound of fingers snapping. \" Step on it, kid. I've got places to be.\" Something hit me in the back of the head. I looked down at his credit card laying on the ground behind my feet. \" Come on!\" He said angrily.

Abraham heaved himself up from his recliner with the help of his cane. He hobbled into the kitchen and pulled the TV dinner out of the microwave. A fork, a knife, and 5 minutes of hobbling later- he had his TV tray situated in front of him with his 2 1/2 Minute Salisbury Steak steaming. As he went to eat his first bite a quick knock came from the door. He turned up his hearing aid and there it was again. Another knock. A man ca n't even enjoy a nice meal. Grumbling, Abraham heaved himself out of his recliner with his cane and hobbled to the door. He peeked through the peephole and found himself staring at another eyeball pressed against the glass on the opposite site. He recoiled in disgust. \" Mr. Johanson! \", a voice called from the other side of the door, \" Are you home?\" \" I'm not buying! I do n't need my yard cut, an alarm installed, a magazine subscription, a set of knives, or any other fancy thing you're selling!\" \" I'm not a salesman,\" the man on the other side of the door laughed. \" Can we talk for a minute, please?\" What could the man want then? Abraham sighed. How long had it been since he received a visitor? 6 months? He creaked the door open, but kept the chain bolt latched. He peered through to find a young man peering back at him. The guy was in his mid 20s, a scruffy red beard, and slightly overweight. \" What do you want?\" Abraham barked. A wide smile spread across the young man's face. \" M-my name is Daniel Everton!\" Abraham grunted. \" Good for you.\" \" I ca n't believe it's you! You're my favorite character!\" Abraham slammed the door. Not enough time for this bullshit. He turned to go back to his dinner and another knock came from the door. Daniel's voice called out to him, muffled by the oak door, \" Mr. Johanson! Please! I just want to meet you!\" \" Go away, you lily-livered sack of shit.\" \" Can I just take a picture with you please? Please!\" \" Go away!\" \" Please!

That was brutal man!\" Abraham gripped the door and ripped it open. The bolt latch ripped from the wall tearing dry wall with it. He shoved the end of his cane towards Daniel's face and watched him recoil from the porch. \" You listen to me you little prick,\" he seethed. Spit sprayed from his mouth, his eyes narrowed, and he thrusted the cane to emphasize the word prick. \" You do n't know a goddamn thing about my Dorothy. I do n't know who you are and what you want, but I will end you. I,\" he took a deep breath. His jowls jiggled as he shook his head. His heart raced. \" I... I... will fucking end you... Do you...\". A loud ringing sounded in his ears. The world went dark. Abraham opened his eyes and realized he was staring up at his ceiling. A pillow was under his head, a blanket was over his body. He forced himself to sit up. So it was n't a nightmare. Daniel was sitting his recliner. Daniel was eating his Salisbury Steak. Daniel was watching his goddamn TV. \" What are you doing in my house!\" he roared. \" Mr. Johanson!\" Daniel rushed from the recliner and knelt next to the couch. Abraham watched him as he reached out to take his hand. He slapped at Daniel's hand. \" Do n't you touch me!\" \" I am here for you, man.\" Daniel said, ignoring the slap. \" Is there anything I can get you?\" \" You can give me some answers, you little prick. What are you doing in my house?\" \" Mr. Johanson... you collapsed. I brought you in here.\" \" You're also eating my Salisbury Steak.\" Daniel's cheeks turned red. \" I was... hungry.\" \" You're going to compensate me $ 5.62 for my dinner. America may be free...\" \"... but life sure as hell is n't!\" Daniel interrupted. \" I love that saying! I use it all the time!\" \" Where'd you hear that?\" Abraham asked. His father had told him that line when he was a kid. It has been somewhat of his mantra throughout his life. \" From you, man! When you were introduced in Season 2, you said it. Dorothy said she wanted to go somewhere nice on vacation. Like Germany. You said no, you guys would go back to Gatlinburg, Tennessee! It was closer, cheaper, and full of German-like fake stuff. You said,'America may be free, but life sure as hell is n't'!\" How did this piss-ant know about Germany? Gatlinburg? \" What is going on?\" Abraham whispered. He stared into Daniel's eyes. \" Please, tell me... what is happening.\" Abraham closed his eyes and shook his head as Daniel explained once more he was his favorite character in a TV show. \" Your life has been crazy man,\" Daniel said. \" When Evelyn was born, and you held her that first time alone in the hospital and promised to lover her forever and you told her that her momma went to be with Jesus... the feels man! The feels!\" Abraham's eyes watered. \" My baby girl...\" he whispered. \" That time you went to her school play in the 1st grade. She thought you were working, and you did n't want her to know you were there because you were embarrassed. Men were supposed to be strong. Not show emotion. But she knew you were there! She saw you! Man, she sure did love you!\" \" Stop it!\" Abraham pleaded. \" Stop it! This is my life you are talking about it.\" \" Man, I cried right along with you when Evelyn was 16. She kissed you good night. It was the last time you would see her and you knew something was wrong in the pit of your stomach. The car accident.. man...\" Abraham lunged at Daniel but fell feebly to the floor. He wept uncontrollably. Daniel knelt next to him. \" Hey man. You okay? You want me to get you some water?\" Abraham just wept. Minutes went by as he relived his most precious moments. The ones with his wife. The ones with his daughter. The two most important women in his life who never met each other, but both left him too soon in life. He sat up. \" This is.. my life,\" he whispered. \" My memories. They are n't for your entertainment! I am a real person with real feelings! These are real issues! And you have seen it all. Everyone has.\" Daniel shrugged. \" Sorry man. You know how writers are.'Kill Your Darlings'and all that jazz.\" \" This does n't even make sense. You are what- 25 at the most? Dorothy passed away 30 years ago. Evelyn 24 years ago. How could you have possibly seen everything?\" \" Your show is a Netflix original, man! I binge watched that shit all last weekend! Like I said man, the feels! So good!\" Abraham lunged at him, knocking them both to the floor. He gripped his cane and pressed it hard against his throat. Tears swelled in his eyes as he pushes the cane harder and harder. His heart fluttered as Daniel's eyes bulged and his mouth gasped for air. A grin formed across Abraham's face. He strained, spittle dribbling down his jowls, \" Kill your darlings, they say.\" Daniel flailed struggling underneath Abraham. His face turned blue. Veins burst under his flesh where the cane was pressing against his neck. He slowly stopped struggling. His arms went to rest by his side.

And you spend millions trying to reverse this process. You there, Ms. Reisz. How much of you is plastic now? You look beautiful considering you're 60 years old, but how long until your skin sags just that little bit more?\" Reisz glared up at him while the rest of the crowd chuckled. This at least was now a show. \" But what if there was another way? What if I could give you a place where you never aged? Where all your basic needs were dealt with? Where you could truly live the lives of comfort you work for every day? What if... I gave you immortality to match your fame?\" Now they were interested. Now was the time. Lee set his pen down and placed the neural copy helmet he had stashed under the podium on. \" I have created such a place. A place that lives in the streams of data that exists in the internet.

And no matter what, you could show your art to the world.\" He engaged the servers, and watched as his Process spun up, waiting for neural input. He placed the helmet on his head and felt the strange pressure that his volunteers had described. His vision swam and suddenly he was in the lobby he had designed from scratch. He walked over to the screen in front and switched it on. The camera in the meeting room switched to life, and he saw his slumped body surrounded by concerned citizens. He cleared his throat to get their attention, and as they all looked to the big screen television that had turned on in their world, he swept back his arms and proclaimed, \" I would like to be the first to present to you, my loyal fans and future citizens - the city of Cloudbank.\" He pulled the Transistor from it's resting place as the clamoring began in the real world.

{"input": "Humanity, after making a trans-galactic flight to find more life is surprised to have only found... more humanity.", "output": "It all started with that signal. That beautiful, horrible, awe-inspiring, hope-crushing, *amazing signal*. We did n't believe it at first. The report came in from the edge of humanity's vast galactic nation, nearly fifty trillion people large and spanning for thousands upon thousands of light years across. It had n't taken us very long to establish it, either -- with the creation of a practical Alcubierre drive, we had established our foothold on the galaxy in a little over a century and a half. As we searched other solar systems, other nebulas, learning just exactly how small our world was, our culture began to flourish in an indescribably numerous and significant number of ways. Technology after technology developed, new forms of art never considered before created, and -- well, all you have to do is pick up a standard sized history book. Most of them that cover our expansion into the starts clock in around the 20 exabyte range. Yet despite our advancements, our race grew very lonely. Why? Because we were alone. I mean, of course we were n't *alone* in the conventional sense, there were trillions of us, but alone as in... it's hard to explain in words, you'll have to forgive me, but I'm sure you've felt it before. It's that feeling you get when you're on a deep-zone flight on the observation deck in complete silence, just looking up at the myriad of bright lights in the sky, and you just have this feeling of almost religious adoration of the universe. But when you see all of those stars, and are faced with the possibility that you are part of the select few chosen to witness and truly experience this naturally holy experience with no other truly different people... that thought just horrified me. But when we saw the signal aimed at one of our furthest outposts, we knew that just being sad about it was n't going to be enough. About a day after they got it, the research personnel on the TFV *Cape Horn* reported their findings to our high command through our ansible network on its emergency channel, and for good reason. What they had found, travelling through intergalactic space, was a microwave-length signal. Not very surprising -- these could be found all throughout space. What the research staff was able to discern was. After intense study of the wave, they realized that it was the precise frequency of the hyperfine change in a hydrogen electron's ground state, approximately 1420.40575177 MHz ( I took that from one of our reports, I'm not an engineer ), multiplied by pi. Because of that multiplication by pi, this signal could not have been natural in origin. Indeed, it had been theorized over two hundred years ago that this could be used to contact extraterrestrials, but the idea had been rejected by the nation states of the time as frivolous. They obviously did not feel the loneliness we did. After coming to this realization in 2175 CE, as you all still call it, we set our sights beyond our own galaxy to get to where this signal had been sent from. Andromeda was our next step, obviously, but there were serious problems that arose from trans-galactic flight. There were the obvious problems with fuel needs, sustaining a crew in unexplored space for that long, and other such long-term spaceflight needs. But the worst part of it all was when, on one of our first extra-galactic test flights, we learned that certain traits of null space caused rapid degradation of the Alcubierre drive's warp bubble and corrupted the core. The ship would be dead in the water, with only atmospheric thrusters to move itself around. We got stuck on this problem for a while. For the next fifty years, scientists continually labored to try to find an alternative to the Alcubierre drive. Ideas, all worthless in the end, were thrown around the scientific community in full view of the public. Eventually it just became a blame game -- the spotlight was turned on who *weren't* making steps towards progress instead of the people who were. But a solution was found, believe you me. I'm afraid its specifics are a state secret, however, but I'm sure our government will authorize their release soon enough. As soon as a working model was developed, a ship was hastily built, a bunch of diplomats, scientists, soldiers, and ship engineers were taken from their previous assignments and practically thrown on the boat before it was sent off to the origin of the signal. I could n't blame the government, though. After fifty years of stagnation, they needed a galactic morale boost. The trip was rather long and much rougher compared to what most of these people were used to -- over three months of destitute living -- but the crew made the best of it. Through power shortages, water spillages, and even a death, they soldiered right on through until they became the first Terrans to ever enter another galaxy. It barely took an hour to find the source of the signal. It was a destitute satellite, falling apart. It was clearly abandoned long ago. But the mission was to find extraterrestrial life, and damn the whole of creation if they were n't going to go and find it. It took some time, though. Two weeks of relentless searching yielded no results. Morale had dropped to an all-time low on the ship. But just before we had all given up hope, they came. They popped onto the sensors as if they had been there the whole time. A huge capital ship stood before the tiny in comparison Terran ship, flanked by two large escort vessels. The whole crew of the Terran ship was in awe -- what exactly were they supposed to do now? Luckily, the crew of the other ship was polite enough to make the first move. They opened what seemed to be a docking bay, and flashed a series of warm colored, inviting lights. \" Come right in.\" they seemed to say. And so the ship did. Slowly it began its maneuver into the ship's bright, empty docking bay, thrusting further and further into it before it was stopped by some kind of restraining beam. As the ship was locked into place, however, the doors remained open. The commanders of this vessel were perhaps afraid, and rightly so, of their guests getting the wrong message. Soon after, some kind of airlock-like tube was attached to its counterpart near the bridge. The lead diplomat called all of the members of the ship onto the bridge to present themselves in front of the airlock. They waited for what must have seemed like multiple eternities. This moment, thousands of years in the making, was finally about to happen. Eventually the airlock slowly began to open, causing almost everyone to start up, surprised. But the lead diplomat did not falter. He held his head high, waiting for the diplomats of this other race to introduce themselves. As the doors finally opened, everyone was silent. Oh, the anticipation was horrible. They did n't even care what the aliens looked like, sounded like, or did at that point. They just wanted them to do something. *Pat. * A single step. *Pat. * Another one. *Pat pat pat pat pat pat. * Six steps, from the airlock, just outside the viewing range of the humans. Eventually that being did move into the view of the Terran party, after more slow, careful steps. And when he finally did, the lead diplomat, the strong man with a reputation for being a cool and collected operator, could not help himself from laughing. And neither could the man in front of him. When both of our civilizations were looking for something beyond ourselves, we had found a mirror. Humanity had finally found its long lost intelligent cousin -- humanity. What a beautiful day that was. My pen may not do it justice, but I hope you may understand the Terran perspective better now through this letter. While I joke about our race being the same, it is clear that our civilizations have developed quite differently. While we are certainly brothers, my friend, our civilizations have developed quite differently, and one of the coming challenges of this new era will certainly be closing that divide. We still remain as two governments ruling over a single people. But that is currently the way things are, and it will have to do for now. So as you take on your role as my counterpart in your own government, I hope you recognize both of our histories not as separate, diverging paths that coincidentally met, but instead as two paths that have been since their conception destined to become one. -James Armstrong, Terran Diplomat to the Firmian Empire", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

But as he passed him a single note, sealed in an envelope, my curiosity grew. And I can still remember the jubilation on father's face. He set the document on the dinner table, ever so slightly. And then he leaped up from his seat, in a burst of joy! \" MY SON IS ALIVE!\" he shouted! \" MY SON IS ALIVE!\" A great feast was planned. The best chefs from all corners of the nation were brought to the royal palace.

I read through the note passed to my father that fateful night, over and over again. Especially the bottom line. It held an email address.

{"input": "The Pursuer", "output": "It found me in the Forest of Fallen Giants. I had just climbed a ladder, and killed the hollows above, when the giant bird flew by. A huge sword slammed into the ground, right next to me. Instinctively, I rolled away from it, and then watched the bird. It was carrying something. Something metallic, shining in the sunlight. The bird passed overhead again, dropping the object. It was a suit of armour, but I could tell at a glance that it was controlled by some mass of souls. It landed next to the sword, then, rising up, it raised the sword, and floated half a foot above the ground. It looked to me, and from beneath its visor came a red glow which promised death. I never stood a chance. It destroyed me. As I faded, I felt a sense of satisfaction emanating from it. It had done its job. For now. I stepped out of the bonfire, feeling less myself. I ran back to where I had fought the beast. It had taken all of my souls, and left. Was it trying to make me go hollow? The next time I met it, I was stronger. Strong enough to just about defeat it, with the help of the ballistae in the area that we fought in. But it was getting to me. Would I be able to defeat it if it came after me again? I did n't know. Talking to the other undead in Dranglaic, I discovered that they had started calling it the Pursuer. It was designed to hunt down undead, and destroy them, no matter how long it took. If it had chosen me to pursue, then there was nothing I could do but run. I could never truly destroy it, it would keep coming back, with the single-minded determination to kill undead. Two meetings, and twenty deaths at its hands later, I started to run away. But it followed me, wherever I went. I left Dranglaic, in hopes that it was confined to its borders. It was not. It found me, no matter what land I visited, no matter how many souls I gathered, or how few. No matter how hollow I became, it hunted me. Finally, I came to a poisonous swamp, and in that swamp, I found a great tree. Barely retaining my humanity, I climbed down the inside of the tree, surrounded by silence, and eerie statues. Finally, after fighting my way past some giant mushrooms, I exited the tree, and found a giant lake, far beneath the ground, with an island of ash winding its way among the trees. Looking to my right, I found a bonfire, and rested at it. Next to the bonfire was a man, now so hollow that he could n't even move, in the strangest armour I had ever seen. It was shaped much like an onion, and made the ancient knight look very plump indeed. Muttering an apology to the man who once wore this armour, I took it for myself, and strapped it on. Looking up, I saw, as I knew I would, the Pursuer. Hefting my sword, I charged at it, one last time. For I knew, if I lost this time, I would truly lose myself.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I threw out a beam of ice as I slid across the ground, but the other mage deflected it with a flick of his wrist. \" Do your still think you have a chance, Kristen?\" The other mage taunted. \" Your parlor tricks are nothing more than small annoyances, while my magic,\" he lifted a glowing hand into the air, electricity spiking off in all directions, \" are much more dangerous.\" He finished speaking; a bolt of lightning crashed towards me. My half-prepared shield absorbed the brunt of the impact, but I still slid a couple feet backwards. His name is Verun. He's considered a prodigy - the sheer amount of mana he can control rivals that of famous archmages, and lightning is considered the strongest elemental affinity one can have. I've made quite a name for myself in this school - an unknown water mage with low mana capacity who consistently performs exceptionally - but no one expects me to do particularly well against Verun. Even if his affinity did n't counter mine, his incredible capacity should allow him to overwhelm me with basic spells alone. Another bolt came from his hands. I lifted my shield, but this time the bolt arced away, slamming into my arm instead. \" I really do n't want to do this Kristen.\" He was looking at my now-broken arm. \" If I hurt you much more they wo n't be able to completely heal you. I'm completely out of your league - there's nothing you can do. It's not shameful to admit it, you've impressed everyone here just by making it this far. Please, do n't make me keep doing.\" One of the professors stood up, looking like he was ready to call the match. Verun was right. Another hit like that and I would n't be the same. It takes a lot of energy to heal a broken arm - it will take me at least a week to recover from this. Anything else and I wo n't be able to fully heal. And there really is n't anything I can do if I keep playing like this. His attacks are simply stronger than mine, and he can keep going far longer. I stood up, grinning. The professor could see my confidence so he stood back down, willing to wait just a little longer. \" The only reason you think you're'out of my league'is because we are playing entirely different games.\" As I spoke, Verun twitched. \" There's nothing you can do any more, Verun. From this moment on you wo n't hit me a single time.\" He screamed. Sure I was impressive, but he is the prodigy. He is the unbeatable. I'm sure the fact that he even has to fight me has already infuriated him, but now I just directly insulted him. He gathered a massive storm of electricity around his body. Electricity crackled out, scorching the ground. All of the professors stood up, trying to stop him and call the match. A bolt of lightning - much larger than anything he had sent earlier - came flying towards me. I grinned and held out my remaining arm. A thread of blue mana flew out from my finger and slid through the bolt of lightning. His magic was made from tiny yellow threads, and I had spent the past several minutes finding out exactly how they were held together. My mana weaved around these yellow threads and, in a single instant, constricted. The lightning dissapeared. A moment of confusion crossed his face, but them immediately after Verun screamed, throwing out more lightning. Bolt after bolt danced across the gap between us, and each one was taken down by a single thread of mana. \" Your attacks are better than mine.\" Another bolt of lightning dissapeared. \" Your capacity is greater than mine.\" My wrist flicked, shooting a stream of ice towards him. \" By all rights you should be stronger than me.\" He raised a shield. \" But you will never be able to beat me.\" Strands of mana constricted, tearing the shield apart. The beam of ice hit him in the chest, knocking him to the ground. He weakly lifted an arm to call more lightning, but a spear of ice slammed his arm back into the ground. The crowd was silent for a moment, unable to comprehend what had just happened. After a few seconds, however, they began to stand and cheer. The professors called the match, clearly looking worn out from worry, and called for healers. Verun had been defeated.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The new president of the United States of America; Cthulhu.", "output": "\" So… now what? \" I was acutely aware that I was shifting back and forth on my feet while flashbacks of that cursed spelling bee ran through my mind. It all started there. If they hadn't laughed at me, I never would have started down this path. I shook my head and refocused on my favorite tentacled Horror. He was staring and it was as terrifying and unnerving as it should be. Then his face-tentacles…face-tacles… twitched. \" What did you do? \" It actually sounded like a wet, garbled dial-up tone…a horrifying, wet, garbled dial-up… but I could hear those words echoing through a terribly infinite void straight into my mind. \" What. Did. You. Do? \" I cringed but managed to get out, \" Well… the world rightly belongs to you… so… \" \" WHAT DID YOU DO! \" Pools of liquid darkness spread out from his…feet… or whatever they're properly called and started infecting the room with the smell of seaweed, brine and an ocean of decay. The darkness stopped at the edge of the summoning circle but began pooling up like a rising tide—a rising tide of terrible demonic decay and dread darkness and doomed…doom. I took a deep breath and prayed to Cthulhu ( ironic, yes ) that this went better than the spelling bee. \" The American people vote for their leader. It's a really corrupted system that uses all these back-room deals with super-delegates, unfairly drawn voting districts and a stacked electoral college. You'd love it. \" He continued working to set the Guinness World Record for longest malevolent stare. I forged on ahead in what I still feel was quite a brave and, dare I say it, heroic manner. \" Anyways, you should be our leader. So I… we that is…your cult… put you on the ballot. \" When he continued to stare, I hedged, \" And you won! \" His stare grew with such intensity that I instinctively stepped back. \" All it took was a few commercials. And a few… \" I coughed discretely before quickly continuing, \" …thousand… sacrifices. You remember those, right? They were the best. Come on, you loved them big guy. \" He still didn't answer and my minded jumped back to that spelling bee. Honestly, what eight year old knows how to spell'eudaemonic'? It wasn't until much later… far too much later… that I looked it up and found it meant'conducive to happiness'. I shook my head and got back on track, \" Honestly, the American people were surprisingly open to the idea. I mean who else were they going to vote for? Trump? Hillary? \" The temperature in the room dropped what felt like a few million degrees. \" You had them vote for me. \" I was momentarily distracted when I saw one of my fellow cultists discretely turn up the thermostat. \" Do you know how many people are calling my name right now? \" He didn't wait for me to answer. \" Enough to fill an entire Void! All those voices… ringing in my head all at once. \" He glared again with his obsidian eyes. \" What do you have to say for yourself? \" \" Congratulations? \" Apparently that was not the right thing to say. He screeched and surged towards me. I couldn't help what happened next. I giggled. I mean, have you ever seen the tentacled face of an angry Elder God pressed against the edge of an invisible wall? My four year old nephew liked to do that against the window every time we got in the car. So I giggled a little… which I maintain was an entirely reasonable thing to do. Then he became incredibly still and stared at the circle containing him. \" You have a speech to give… \" I started to say but when the edges of the circle began to give to bulge alarmingly, I froze. Slowly but surely the circle began to buckle and cold sweat started pouring down my back. I stood there, still paralyzed, and the edges continued to strain and stretch… so I… accidentally… knocked over the alter we used to summon him. I will never forget the sound he made when he was sucked back down into that darkness. It was actually pretty strange. Surreal even. That liquid darkness slurped down into a central point until it disappeared into a pinpoint. Oddly enough, it reminded me so very much of when water rushed down the drain in the tub after a nice bubble bath. And that's how I became President of the United States. I knew putting myself on the ballot as Vice-President was a good idea… and it didn't take me long to know what the first piece of legislation I was going to sponsor was going to be.

Mark and I had been fresh out of college, best buds. We would take a quick job as guards at the French national museum. That was ten years ago next week. *\" I - I do n't know Rob, something feels weird up here....\". \" God dammit Mark we've worked here for ten years, get it together man, it's probably nothing. \" * Every time this happened, every time I went for my weekly check up of the catacombs.

I never tought they were correct however, even with the catacombs down under the public space, it still only felt like there were n't even close to that amount of books there. I took the elevator down to the catacombs, like I did every week. Come to think of it actually, a few years ago I only did this bi-weekly, Mark and I switched around every week, however one day he refused to go down, saying he saw some crazy things down there. Offcourse I never believed him, I mean it has been a few years since then and I never saw anything.... *\" R-rob, man, there is something seriously off man.\" *.

Get some coffee and stay awake okay? \", \" Okay Rob\". * After the elevator there was a small set of stairs I had to walk, I always quietly cursed the designer of this elevator. I knew it was an old building and they probably struck some ancient stuff or something, so they could n't go down further. I did my check up as usual, and as usual nothing out of the ordinairy, the books were still pretty booky I guess. I thought back to the time when I did n't have to go down here every week. I remember that somehow Mark always used to spend half the night down here, where I would cover it in about an hour or two. Something must've been holding him up every night, *Maybe he read the books\" *, I thought to myself. I smirked at my own thought. *\" Wow, that's really the level I am at right now, huh? \" * A faint light distracted me from my thoughts as I was about to head out. It was all the way in the back of the room, way on the edge on one of the furthest shelves, near the wall. It's really one of those books, I had never even noticed before, heck, I never even noticed that shelve. For all I know, that book has always been glowing ever so faintly. I grab the book and swiftly brush through its pages, it's spine read *\" La gloire de Marseille\" *, *\" The glory of Marseille*. I took the book up with me to show it to Mark and offcourse maybe to figure out why on earth an old renaissance book would be glowing in the National libraries catacombs. I rushed upstairs to find Mark asleep, *\" after all that wining over the radio, the guy is vast asleep, offcourse. I mean is n't he always\" *. I sigh. I grab a cup off coffee and sit down next to him for the remaining five hours of our shift. During my five hours of sitting, I get some time to think about what I had found. In my head I made some theories about what the glowing could be. My mind was full of ideas, that I quickly shot down in my mind for being redicolous and overly fantasized. I guessed maybe I just wanted it to be cooler than it probably was. I decided not to show it to Mark as I was planning on \" borrowing\" the book from the library, and I knew mark would be completely against it, actually I was more worried he would shit his pants if he heard I found a glowing book in the catacombs, again, I smirked. Mark woke up and two hours later we were relieved of duty by the day shift, Ryan and... uuuhmm.... uuuh... Ryan and... Eric? I think, I guess I'll have to ask Mark, altough honsetly I doubt he knows... What's his face does n't really talk much. Before I went to bed at my house, I layed the book open on my desk. I brushed through pages and found seemingly random letters had lit up, glowing in a sort of orangy glow. A code, maybe?

They talked to me and I thought I was going crazy, but the next day it was back to… well, normal. \" \" Normal? \" I heard the hesitation. \" If you're making a joke about my mental health now is not the time. \" \" It's just… \" The other me paused. \" It's been a bit off since. Like there's a delay. Like when you see yourself on a webcam and you move a second later on the screen. But not that noticeable, just a fraction of a second. I wouldn't have realised until a bug crawled on the wall and I saw my reflection hadn't turned its head towards it. It was still looking at me. \" That was weird. \" But it's normal otherwise? \" I asked. \" This only lasted a day, right? \" \" Yeah, then today I saw my reflection wasn't there, until you turned up. So I thought I'd warn you. \" I finally got the courage to look at my reflection. She smiled tentatively at me, and I knew I was mirroring the smile. \" It gets better, after this, right? \" The other me nodded. \" Yeah, so just pass it on. \" The next time I checked the mirror it was empty. It was strange to see a room I recognised, but now knew was not mine. But as the other me said, overnight my reflection seemed to have returned. I didn't notice a delay. However, when I turned my back and before I fell asleep that night, it felt like someone was watching me.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The stars stretch overhead, endless and cold in a sky filled with the many coloured clouds of countless distant galaxies. Filled with the countless souls of the created. Beneath my feet the sand pours down into blackness and uncertianty. Behind me time stretches and with it the grey sands of the desert of my mind. How did I get here? The thought is lucid and out of place for my dream. It is the single conscious thought that threatens to shatter this fragile world. The sound that may shatter the delicate crystal walls of this inbetween space. I forget the question. I am here to speak and speak I must. Before me an angel hangs perfectly above the abyss, its wings beat soundlessly and effortlessly. It wears the shroud of the many dead it has cared for, colourless grey cotton wrapped and hanging off an androgynous form. \" You are here for a reason.\" It is a cold statement said by many voices and none- more the echo of words said than words being said. \" My choice has been made sweet companion, not by me but those above\" Tears run down my cheeks and the world feels cold. With each breath ice forms in a rolling cloud that shimmering, reflects the light above. \" You make this choice yourself. You are following a path that will end in regret for us all and those you jealously look upon. To take this path is to end all things as they have been and start a uncertain road for us all\" I know the words are truth and yet they sting.

Death's face is beautiful to behold, it's skin smooth and pale it's lips though unsmiling have a curve to them that suggests a open kindness. \" You like me are crafted. We do not walk a path that is our own. You are shephard to those that leave the mortal world and I must be the balance.

Will your Riders oppose the Lord?\" \" You know the answer Light of the First Star\" \" And what of the others? Will they disobey our Master and break their own chains? Will anyone but me dare to face the wrath of our Keeper...? No! So I will!\" Anger beats in my chest. A rage fueled by the unseen bars and laws that rule me. I am trapped and alone and not even my oldest friend will hear my words. The pain of being a pet created for amusement fires my soul as I stare down into the abyss beneath my feet. I curl my toes around the edge and a steady stream of sand falls between them. Falling into uncertianty in a gush that eventually slows and ends. \" I will be chained for eternity if it means the freedom of those born into bondage.\" The idea is an awful one. A concept that terrifies me, but the concept of freedom for all those who have been created and born into the rule of tyrant fires my strength and fuels me. With nothing to prevent my I bind my wings close to my back, feeling the soft downy feathers pressed against my skin and take a step. Death reaches out a hand, a desperate last gesture as I begin to fall, refusing to open my wings to save myself and the dreamlike realm shatters. Today is the day I shall fall. Today is the day I will start the war in Heaven. For you Mortal I will be bound so you may choose your own path instead of having it forged for you.

Her red boots played tricks with my mind as I imagined draining her from her thighs... Would her blood deepen the red on the boots or just unceremoniously glide past to the white from weeks of snow. That thought took hold of my artistic mind as I pondered the splatter patterns I had so meticulously mastered over the centuries. The masters exalted us above the hungry since we provided refreshments and visual stimulation in one course. Technology was my new fantasy and pushed the boundaries of blood art with new toys. I was afterall, the author of \" bloodsport\". \" Do you want to come in?\" Back to reality, her half invite was all I needed. Today's tragedy would be shot with the nokia 360 degree camera I acquired. I could hear the two drones holding position from the distance, one set to capture images every 2 seconds and the other to make record live film of our short exchange. I had graduated quickly in the ranks of vampires from humble bloody graffiti to bloody shorts. This was my big entry into live streaming. Mainstream YouTubers would not be taking any of this glory. I hesitated and asked to confirm \" Is it okay to come in? I can always come back.\" \" It's perfectly fine.\" she responded and put her hands in her fluffy coat. \" You can start filming now if you want\". Perfect, she was an unwitting accomplice and victim in the vivid live red reel. I could n't have scripted this better. I had contacted them earlier in the week in the guise of making a short film of their new found status as the local celebrities who rescued a young girl from attackers. They were body builders who were at the right place at the right time but today, their home would be the wrong place for them to be. I expected a fight, I expected a bloody fight and I was here to give them a glorious end. I opened my bag and took out the body cam, hooked it to my chest harness. I rolled in the Nokia Ozo mounted dolly and whistled the tunes \" oh happy days\". I was a performer and I could imagine the crowd going beserk at my performance. This was the build up. As I stepped into the room, the lights suddenly became brighter blinding me for a second. I could hear the door shut behind me and immediately felt a sharp incising back pain. My thoughts raced but I could not think fast enough to account for the sharp turn of events happening. I was under attack. I was being cut, blinded, pulled, chained, and burned. The ceiling had been lined with UV lights and speakers blared out obscene catholic choir hymns. I could feel the ozo dolly pulled away from my grasp and I struggled to open my eyes amidst the blinding glare. I was trapped. My plans, motivations, art, life was about to be taken from me. All I could imagine was that my fans were about to be treated to a first class horror showing... I felt the glare dim and I opened my eyes just in time to see Jim walk towards me with a silver axe in hand. He smiled, quiet and then nodded to someone behind me.

I had an episode that felt like I was living the lives of different people. Although at the same time I somehow knew these people were all me; like we live in a multiverse or something and I'm a freak that could experience their lives as vividly as mine. \" It was such a surreal experience. I really ca n't describe it, Doc. \" I was sitting on a cushy recliner, just as you'd expect from a shrink's office. Doctor Mathers was my therapist for twenty odd years. He was a short bald man with a very dark tan. \" Now, Derrick, I told you to elaborate whenever you recall a memory. \" Dr. Mathers tapped a finger which I presumed was impatience. \" And do n't worry Derrick, I'm tapping on my clipboard because I'm fascinated with what you need to say. \" \" You really are the best, huh? It's creepy that you can read my thoughts. \" I felt the aura of his grin pull on my standing neck hairs. \" Well, it's like I described last session. I have flashbacks of different people's lives. All sorts of folk from different times and different parts of the world. \" For instance, the first memory I recalled was of a man that was just about to make love with his wife. I think he had kids because I could hear their laughter in the next room ov—— \" \" Hold on, Derrick, \" Dr. Mathers interrupted, \" I have to point out that we did rule out schizophrenia in the last session you mentioned. I came to the conclusion that you have a normal worldview and you seem to function normally in society—for a writer. But I do have to say that I will not rule anything out in my diagnosis based on additional findings in this session. Now, please continue. \" I sighed with exaggeration, \" Alright, where was I… Ah, yes. The next memory was of a kid. He got beat up by his brother because he talked back with a lot of lip. The kid was a geek and he knew it, but he still said whatever he wanted. He got hit hard and hit his head on the edge of a desk. I'm not sure if he survived, but does it really matter? I mean, it was all in my head, right? Well, at least it feels like it was, now that I'm here talking to you about it. \" After the kid, it got really dark. It was a soldier fighting in World War 1. He experienced shock especially because his entire squad died from an arty shell. He had a brief moment of clarity in helping his commanding officer defend their trench, but in the end, he got murdered from an enemy bayonet. \" The next memory I remember is really boring. It was a man meditating. I'm not sure what was happening but I think he was on drugs because he was hallucinating big time. I saw all sorts of things like flowers and stars and white splotches against a black background. \" My most recent memory is of a man in thirteenth century Japan fighting against the Mongol invasion. He fought hard and even managed to board a Mongol ship. But he was n't prepared for the enemy's firearms and so he died heroically. \" Hey, Doc. You with me? \" I asked Dr. Mathers. I thought he fell asleep. \" Yes, of course, Derrick. I'm a professional. I'm not about to fall asleep. \" He paused. He always paused before he was going to tell me something profound. \" Look. Your stories sound, interesting, but, I think they should be put on paper, and not, hmm... \" Dr. Mathers stuttered. He never did so for the past ten sessions. \" I don't think your stories should be told to others as if they're your memories. Now, I've never stammered with my words before, and you know that, so I will reassure you that I am being completely honest with my advice.

Also originally a male, and an ice demon in the game. **Queen Degos**:... we do n't talk about Degos. And with that, let's actually begin the story. ) Adrian and Melissa prepped themselves as they were ready to face off against the Fearful Four again for the second time in their lives. Adrian lifted her peaked hat from her eye so she could see what she was actually punching with her knuckle dusters, while Melissa cleaned off her double blades. \" Ready for a final battle, Melissa?\" Adrian asked. \" Totally. I never really liked that Vintor girl anyway, so this should be fun!\" Melissa cheekily grinned. Adrian herself hated Ayume Invoke, even more so than Vintor. Ayume Invoke had tried to take the soul of the fairy she loved, Nathaniel, to Invoke back when they first met. She was going to enjoy it. \" Alright, let's do this!\" The two of them nodded. Adrian briefly looked at herself and Melissa in the mirror. It had been nine years since the mysterious disappearance of the Frightful Four. When the two of them took them on, they were practically still children. Although they did n't look like it at the time, Melissa was 16 and Adrian 13. Since then, they were adults for real, having become more mature since then. She took in their features; Melissa's blue-and-purple hair, tied back with a big, red ribbon, Adrian's bright pink eyes and straight peacock green hair, and how similar, yet different, they looked together. Melissa's golden eyes showed excitement, as if she could n't wait to rush into an adventure, while Adrian's eyes were calm and collected, like she knew every place better than her closest friend's face. She looked at her left eye and mentally sighed. It was slightly foggy, where she was blind in that eye, after their battle with Vintor. The freezing temperatures, along with Vintor's ice magic, had caused her to lose sight in that eye. She did n't care, though. *An eye for Melissa's life. * She thought. Melissa had been close to death by Vintor, and had Adrian not suddenly stepped in the direction of Vintor's ice blast, which had directly struck her in that eye, Melissa would have died. They took one last breath and rushed into the portal where the showdown would be held in: The Magical Book Room in the Velfa Library. Adrian never really liked the atmosphere there. It was always so... quiet. The books and the lighting were supposed to be warm and comfortable, like a home away from home, but to her, she hated the silence. \" Alright, you four, show yourselves!\" Melissa shouted out when they entered the room. What they heard was Sphinx calmly call out, \" Melissa? That you?\" like she was an old friend instead of an enemy. Naturally, the two were taken aback. \"... Where are you four?!\" Adrian reluctantly shouted back. \" Book Room 2. Hyunmu, do n't breathe on me like that, I'm trying to read.\" Adrian took a step forward, out of the first room and into the second. She was promptly greeted by at least three of the original four. Sphinx had her back against the wall, apparently absorbed in a good book, Hyunmu next to her. Vintor was leaning on a window, drawing things using frost magic. Ayume Invoke was nowhere to be seen. Sphinx looked up, shoving Hyunmu off of her. \" Hey, you two. Where ya been all these years? Has Adrian started dating Nathaniel yet? Speaking of which, where is he?\" She asked. \" What're you trying to pull?!\" Adrian tightened her grip on her knuckle dusters even further, as if she was getting ready to fight Sphinx. \" Hey, now. Do n't be like that.\" She put her book down and somewhat raised her arms in the surrender position. At this point, Vintor looked up from her newest artwork of some sort of teardrop. \" Hello, Adrian, Melissa.\" She said coolly. \"... What's going on?\" Adrian asked slowly. Just as she said that, Ayume Invoke came back into the room in midair. Her black demon wings were out and she was clutching a book. \" Darlings! You'll never believe what I found! Oh, hello, you two. How's Nathaniel nowadays?\" She asked. \" I want to know what's going on. You've disappeared for nine years, and when you return, you act like a regular civilian like *you* - \" Adrian pointed at Ayume Invoke. \" - were n't a demon girl that stole souls, and *you* - \" Hyunmu was pointed at next. \" - were n't a greedy man that would kill for his riches, and *you* - \" Sphinx. \" - did n't try to suffocate us in all of your riches when we fought you, and *you* - \" Vintor. \" - did n't try to murder my friend and caused me to go blind in one eye!\" As memory after memory flashed before her one good eye, Adrian had worked herself up to a frenzy. \" You think we can just forget all that?! After you and your queen caused everyone to fear for their lives?! After the only ones who took you down suffered from your actions?! You think I can just forget how we almost died four times?! You think Melissa can forget how she almost died by Vintor's spear?!\" Adrian snapped back. All six of them were completely silent, as Melissa put a calming hand on Adrian's shoulder, which was heaving from how heavily she was breathing. Vintor was the first to speak. \"... Queen Degos.\" She muttered. \" What about her?!\" Adrian snapped. \" When she learned about each and every one of us failed to destroy you...\" Vintor looks down. \"... she kind of snapped. Punished us all by taking away something dear to us. Like what we did to you.\" She begins to concentrate as hard as she could, as if attempting to summon in something. She relaxes after half a minute. \" Queen Degos gashed both of my hands, reducing my magic to only frost.\" Vintor held up both of her hands to show the duo. Sure enough, there was a huge, faded scar on each of them, spanning from the pinky finger to the thumb. \" Master Invoke was disappointed in me, too. As such, he punished me by taking away my ability to steal souls, on top of Queen Degos'punishment, which was my ability to use my magic arrows being taken from me.\" Ayume Invoke chimed in. \" She destroyed half of each of our collection of riches. Right in front of us.\" Sphinx and Hyunmu solemnly muttered at the same time. \" What she did made us reflect on what we did to you, and everyone else.\" Vintor went on. \" We hate what we used to be. Although we can not give you your sight back, or the countless days that everyone else wasted away by fearing for their lives, we can stop others in the future from suffering the same fate as everyone today. Although we were gone, Queen Degos was still a threat to everyone around her. But that will end.\" Vintor stood up, grabbing her spear, which was next to her. The soft, blue light it omitted surrounded her face. \" Together, we can take her down. But in order to do that, we ask for something from you. Forgiveness. We know you will never forget what we used to be. But we do n't want to be like that anymore. We do n't want Degos on the throne anymore. If you can defeat all four of us, together, we can take down the most powerful human on earth. It's all your choices, though. We can not force you to choose.\" The two of them were silent for a full minute, as the others waited anxiously. Finally, Adrian spoke up. \" I forgive you all.\" \" I do, too.\" Melissa perks up. Vintor turns up the corners of her mouth, hardly a smile, but it was evident she was happy. [ \" Thank you. \" ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/AwesomeTrinket/ )", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Following this, we pushed into the island with our great numbers departing from aquatic landings on the southern shore of the island.

Postcards Cookie poured the contents of his pilfered purse on the floor in front of him. He had fallen on hard times and sometimes a gun and a pretty girl were enough for him to pay rent. A series of objects that once belonged to that woman littered his green carpet. He pushed aside the tampons and make-up. Cookie had no use for these things. Turning aside a small cardigan he found it – the wallet! He opened it, turning out its contents too. He looked at her ID picture it was a good picture. \" Who takes a good ID photo? \" Cookie muttered to no one but himself, \" Autumn Rivere – I guess. \" Looking over the small holograms that detailed the plastic card, he noticed her eyes; they were a bright hazel, the same color as her hair. Her cheeks were very prominent, in a way that didn't make her features off-putting, rather gave her face a younger appearance. She was the same age as Cookie, 28, but looked as if she'd been much better off than he. Cookie took the cash from the wallet, $ 117.26. She was the type of person to store her change from the store in her wallet. Cookie did this too, he admired the thought that others did it. He pulled more from the floor, a necklace would sell for a pretty penny. Cookie then noticed two postcards, one was sent to Autumn, the other from a man who must be her paramour. \" Darling, As I wander these small mountain towns, I long for you. Your smile is in every foreign sunrise. I still feel your warmth with light's first rays. Only two months until I get a chance to hold you once again. To forget the feel of a bed I don't know.

The little things about you that remind me how comforting our couch is. Yours, always, Charlie \" Cookie read this. He thought about how some small objects can hold meaning to people. How he stole this woman's sentiments. He looked at the other postcard, its front was a picture of Minneapolis, detailed by the setting sun in what looked to be the summertime. \" Charlie, I miss you, too. Times have been hard without you, I'm barely scraping by with the rent. You miss my elbows? That's so weird. And I guess I miss your elbows, too. That's a good reply, right? Hurry back.

After two minutes of sitting, he returned to digging through the things. Though now, he had a heavier heart. He found a picture of the two of them. Charlie was handsome, like Cookie. He had chiseled cheeks and dimples, in the picture they were both wearing backpacks and stood at the top of a mountain. Cookie began packing everything back into the purse.

Today is your 250th birthday, and you set out to make today your last.", "output": "Uncle Gar once said a man makes three choices before dinner. The first is what to wear. Brazen, rough old man that he was, his charcoal suit was less a suit, and more an altar. His shoulders were square and tight, like a high mantle for the bust of an old god. Intimidated, it would have been easy to say he was cold and distant when I first met him, if it were n't for his fire. I trusted that warmth to get through the first months. Second, where to eat. He insisted on being called'uncle'over'dad'when we had our first meal together. A highway McDonalds off Route 52. I do n't know if it was because he felt as awkward as I did. Or if he wanted distance. Foster families are different. But he asked, \" Where to, Herry?\" Burgers sounded good. So he made it happen. No questions, no \" watch your weight Herry.\" Despite the freeway, it was a quiet drive. And last, where to sit. Automatically, my legs swung towards the nearest corner before I noticed Uncle Gar already sat down with our dinner. In the middle booth, next to a family with kids in softball uniforms. He waited until I took my seat. A few steps later and a short, teen kid sat next to this pillar of a man eating a quarterpounder. I forgot what I had, but his slow, reverent bites stuck. I copied him. Slow bites. It was the most important meal for us, and we had all the time in the world. An odd memory to come up on my 250th birthday, kneeling at his grave. Only today did I learn how old he was. It was a wonder before where his stories came from, but he insisted they were not stories. What he casted over our coffee table in Vermont were legends. Tales of Zeus. It never occurred to me, to ask if any of his tales were real. \" *Uncle Gar, could Zeus really crack a mountain with his lightning? *\" \" *A mountain? Think bigger nephew. *\" It was Uncle's way. And it was mine to follow his fire where I could, to this auburn cemetery scattered with as many tombstones as leaves on the hill. I wished his were not so obviously cracked and worn. It was more recent than most. A few steps of grass later and the journey was complete. I stood by his stone, and talked. Uncle Gar would not have believed the cheesy tan mistake of a suit I wore when I asked her out on our first date. And the Italian chef at the restaurant who was convinced serving the perfect gnocchi was his life's purpose. I pulled her chair and had us sit by the window to watch the cars rumble through the evening. The fact he'd been running that place for over a hundred years made us wonder, but it would be two years and a honeymoon later when we decided it may not have been the perfect gnocchi. But it was the most important one for us. My tale was finished, and my cheeks were wet. A hand reached out to lean on his gravestone. It was bad enough I came home from my first year of college to not find him home. I had not seen him since. Worse that all he left was a bank card, a pin code, and an old dirty McDonalds napkin. A life changing meal not so much for the burger, but the choices that went into it. That cheap, important, happy excuse for a meal. Whether it was his age, the journey, his real name, or the combination of all things that made me understand my Uncle, I could not say. But an emotion took me. A new one I'd been looking for. *I took her out for gnocchi in a dumb suit Uncle, and she loved me for it. * A shaky hand reached into a worn coat for a phone, punched a few numbers, and held it to an ear. \" Grace?\" \" Yeah Herry, I'm here.\" \" I may not be coming home after all.\" A minute later. \" You sure? I got the gnocchi right this time.\" \" I'm sorry I wo n't be there for it.\" \" Damned shame.\" \" I know. But if its right, maybe I'll expect you for dinner upstairs?\" \" Hope so. I'd like that.\" \" Me too Grace. I'll save a seat'til you get here. Take your time.\" The phone dropped into a coat pocket, and an old man kneeled by a gravestone. *Such a dumb suit Uncle. Not nearly cool as yours. * And he'd have laughed. It was his way.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Lilacs and daisies and all the best blooms of the early summer. I stare at her lips, entranced. Even from across the expanse, I can smell them, an intoxicating mix.

I was asking for your consent to record this meeting.\" She gestures to the small silver and blue recorder in the center of the table. I nod, then shake myself out of it. She needs a verbal release, of course. \" Yes, I consent,\" I say, my voice rusty from disuse. I clear my throat self consciously. She smiles at me kindly. \" Thank you so much for seeing me. I know that your lawyer advised against it.\" She taps the pen on her lips, gathering her thoughts. \" As you you know, I'm writing a book about... the murders.\" She looks embarrassed to bring the matter up. I simply nod. She continues. \" The biggest question of all is one that only you can answer. Mr. Reardon... You said in court several times that the people that you killed were bad men. You said that you could tell by looking at them. Is that what really happened? Of course, Silas Bills and Kevin Crawford were very bad men, but no one knew about that until after their death. Tyson Barrows was just a kid, though, and certainly not a bad person. He was just a normal high school student.\" I struggle to formulate an answer that she would understand. \" Barrows was just as bad as Bills and Crawford, maybe worse.\" I know from experience to not even try to tell her about how I can see the rot of evil on people. It's something that actually helps here in avoiding the people who are truly bad and not just misguided or sick. \" But what did he do?\" She leans forward slightly, and Ronson shifts in the chair where he is watching us closely. The light around his head dims a little in his concern. I smile at him reassuringly, and he smiles back. \" I do n't know,\" I say. \" I did n't know what the other two did, either. I know who people are in their souls.\" She shivers at the certainty of my voice, looking uneasy. I try to smile at her, but it makes her more nervous, so I school my face back to neutrality again. \" I do n't believe in any god or devils, Miss Colbeth.\" It's usually the next question. \" But I can see the evil that walks the land. Bills was a child pornographer and pedophile with at least forty victims,\" I say as calmly as I can. \" Crawford kidnapped and drugged women and forced them into sexual slavery, living like a king on the profits of their misery.\" I feel myself getting upset, and try to breathe deeply as I've been taught - before Ronson decides that I'm becoming agitated and guides me back to my lonely room - perhaps with the drugs that make everything so confused and misty. I do n't like not being able to see things properly. It's dangerous to not know. \" But, all this started when your son, Tyler,\" She began, and I could n't stop a small whimper. She presses on with her question, but I see the sympathy in her eyes. \" When Tyler died in the accident.\" I shake my head, feeling the tears well as I think of my son's brief life. Ronson rises from the chair by the door. \" I think that this interview is over.\" He says flatly, putting his heavy hand gently on my shoulder. She moves to make a protest, but he ignores her, and I allow him to guide me to the door. I turn to watch the roses that fall from her eyes as I am led back to my room. \" It'll be okay, Chris, \" Ronson says kindly. \" Everything will be fine. \" ___ Edit: Changed his name, it was very close to hallflukai's character's name.: )", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Why I chose to exit my sanctuary with no shoes on, I am not quite sure. But here I am, bare foot in a large, stark, white room. Tables circle the perimeter, each with various equipment or tools resting upon. But there is something else that circles the perimeter of the room. People. Eyes stare at me, the odd gasp is uttered.

My eyes dart up to the source of the sound. About half way down the room is a suspended platform. It is linked to the cold floor I stand upon by a steel staircase, on which the man now clanks down towards me. \" Er, hello\" the second time I use the phrase, but this time even less certain. The confidence of this man's greeting has even further unsettled me. He approaches, the tails of his white coat flapping behind his brisk stride towards me. An out stretched hand, a position I nervously reciprocate, my sweaty palm lankly grasping his wide fingered grip. His vigorous shake rattles my clenched teeth. \" What a delight it is to see you. And to think, I had told Egbert that you were my least promising subject!\" His manic grin flashes in front of my face, steel blue eyes glint under the fluorescent lighting. \" Subject?\" I venture, the word feeling awkward as I utter it. \" Yes. Your resistance to them is remarkable. Just 53 hours it took you to leave the accommodation\" \" 53 hours? It felt like years.

I forget. Not often we get straight-brains these days\" \" Straight-brains?\" I wondered if he was attempting to mock me with his made up words He broke my gaze and began to pace. His shoes chimed of the ceramic floor, echoing across the room. \" I am going to be level with you Mr Ivenson. My colleagues insist that I should be gentle with the new subjects, but I feel that we do n't have time for that. Plus I ca n't stand elongated exposition.\" He pauses, the pacing halts as he turns to peer back at me. \" Er, ok\" my frown deepens \" 27 years ago we were invaded\" another pause \" Invaded? By who? The Chinese?\" I was never that up on current affairs, too boring, but I remember one or two things about the rise of the East. People on reddit getting bent out of shape about it. The man laughs that uneasy laugh again. \" You are thinking too small\" \" Small?\" \" The invasion came from further away\" \" Russia?\" I suggested. Geography was never my strong point. \" No. Further. Kepler-438b to be precise\" he recommenced his pacing \" That some place in North Korea?\" it did n't sound Korean, but I talk too much when uncertain He ignored me and continued \" They did n't need ray guns or death stars, rather they just told the human species to bow before them. And bow we did\" \" You've lost me\" \" Cortex manipulation\" uttered as if it explained everything \" Still lost\" \" They are advanced enough to stride across galaxies like you stride across the kitchen to fetch another beer\" he looked at me disdainfully. Suddenly the last 53 hours using the ample supplies of the fridge in my confinement felt a bit less fun. He continues \" They are also advanced enough to alter our synapse connections\" he looked at me, taking in my ongoing bafflement. \" To control our brains Mr Ivenson\" This time it was me that sniggered. \" Brain controlling aliens?\" I asked incredulously.

Of all the important things in my life I could be doing when I die working will be the most appropriate. I clear my throat. Wasting the precious moments left in this world. \" It seems that...\" I ca n't do it. What the hell. I crack my neck and try again. \" It seems that...\" Frozen again and running out of time to be frozen. In my ear I hear my producer. He is n't angry for my fuck up, I only hear sadness come from him and into my earpiece. \" Spit it out kid. It's the only thing left to do.\" My mind immediately rebels against thought. Looking at the time I see that there is only 15 seconds left. \" Sorry folks, I'm just getting word now that,\" I pretend to check my earpiece. My producer, now confused is talking to me. \" What are you doin sport?\" \" It seems that we've gotten a false report and mistook it for news. Have a lovely rest of your day, and life.\" I smile to the camera and the transmission cuts as the shaking begins.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The conflict between the groups is thought-provoking and I'm always a sucker for stories with multiple POVs. However, the main drawback I found as I was reading was that the characters all seem to have the same voice. Their dialogue and speech patterns are too similar to make them distinct from one another. This could be because a lot of the focus in this first chapter is to illustrate the current political climate of your world, but giving the reader more insight into the characters'personality would go a long way to help draw them into your story.

But its moon was a solid rock, but with so much more. Spires of rock entwined with purple flesh that pulsated and beated, with eyes and small hairs that seemed to detect the world around it. Crab like creatures with huge mouths that dragged along the floor, striking scarlet and blue hovering insects with many many wings that twirled through the sky. Every image, every video was filled with something new. Rocks with straight edges, that looked almost carved, a bipedal creature with a torso made of rippling tentacles, something that vaguely looked like a horse, except made up of two large scales that split down the centre of its body. It was both horrifying and beautiful. But there was something more to this world. Something in the corner of the images, a dark silhouette. Terrifying.

I mean... do you appreciate the look of the city from up here?\" Looking back over the city, she gave herself one last moment to analyze it further before giving a response. She traced the freeways in her mind, following their paths with her eyes. She glanced over the industrial parks and the high rise apartments. The setting sun glittered on the glass sides of buildings and the surface of the river that ran through the middle of it all. But nothing came to her; not one thought or emotion. Nel sighed. \" What is there to appreciate?\" \" Just... the look of it.\" Jace leaned up against the ledge that Nel was sitting on, gazing at the landscape. \" I think it's beautiful.\" Peering out as well, she furrowed her brow into an expression of half anger, half confusion. \" I do not understand.\" There was a lull as Jace carefully considered his options, searching for a question that might spark understanding in Nel. \" Well,\" he started, \" Tell me what you like about it. If anything.\" \" The city or the view of it?\" \" Either or.\" \" The view is good. I like the height of this building; it provides a good vantage point for isometric visualization of the buildings. If we were too high I might only see rooftops, too low and I would only see one wall. The city is good too. It is well designed, with thoroughfares feeding traffic efficiently through the city. I did not see a single traffic jam in the last five hours.\" Jace shook his head and smiled. \" You're still looking at this from the wrong point of view, Nel. Try to be more... artistic with your descriptions.\" \" I do not understand.\" She repeated. \" What is the purpose of this exercise?\" \" To get you to think like a human.\" \" I was not designed to think like a human. I am a machine with finite purpose. My utility could be better employed in household chores or companionship. This day has been wasted staring at buildings that need not be stared at.\" \" I do n't think so.\" Jace kept his eyes on the horizon. The sun glimmered its last rays upon the city, finally retreating to only illuminate the clouds farthest away from them. The city's lights were slowly coming online as the sky darkened above them. \" Nel, what does make you happy?\" \" Serving my masters profitably.\" \" But you were n't happy today, even though you only did what I told you to.\" \" I am frustrated with this day because nothing fruitful came of it. I was designed to value my accomplishments. This was idle work. I accomplished nothing.\" \" Just because you have n't made progress does n't mean it was a waste of time.\" Jace tore his eyes away from the city and looked at Nel, who he was surprised to find was already staring straight back at him. \" You'll get it one day.\" Nel slid back onto the balcony, away from her precarious seat on the ledge. Standing next to Jace, she folded her hands together and bowed her head respectfully. \" May I make a request?\" \" Only if you ditch the formalities. In fact,\" Jace perked up, as an idea had just hit him. \" Make it a demand, instead.\" For a moment, Nel looked conflicted. She moved in a single, short, jerking motion, and then froze.

Please excuse any formatting errors, but spelling and grammar is fair game. ** Adelaide sprinted through the ruined shipyard, leaping over piles of rubble and the occasional skeleton. She could hear her squad-mates, spread throughout the facility, shouting for her to see reason. They did n't seem to properly understand what they were demanding from her. She stopped a moment and crouched down in the shadows and listened. Several heavy footsteps closing in from all around, someone was running along the catwalks... Probably Rourke or Emmerick, the snipers. She crept up to a corner and peered around it. She could see the silhouette of Danis, carefully sweeping through the darkness with his flashlight off. Adelaide fired a few bursts at him. \" Stay back, Danis!\" She commanded. \" I will kill you if you come any closer!\" \" Dammit Adelaide, would you get a grip!\" Danis shouted back. The heavy footsteps had softened. Her squad was attempting to surround her. She broke out of cover and made for a hardened building. It had survived the heavy bombing in the start of the war, but the years of neglect had taken it's toll. She had to duck under a collapsed beam to get inside, and as she did so she tossed a pair of flashbangs behind her. She followed the corridor for a few hundred metres, and eventually found herself in a giant underground dry-dock. She took a couple of steps in, then suddenly heard a loud crash to her left. She ran up to where the noise came from and found Sam struggling to stand in a giant puddle of old lubricant that was leaking from several drums that had smashed on the concrete. \" Stop Sam!\" Adelaide shrieked, trying to keep her emotion out of her voice. \" Stop running!\" Sam sighed and settled on his knees. They stayed in silence for almost a minute, before Sam looked up at Adelaide and began to weep. \" I do n't want to go.\" He said. \" I only just met you, I do n't want to go!\" \" Stop!\" Adelaide cried. She lifted her battle-rifle and aimed at Sam. \" I do n't want this, but it's the only way! You said so, yourself!\" \" No!\" Sam pleaded. \" There's another way, there has to be! Maybe we do n't need him!\" Adelaide wiped a tear from her eye without dropping her aim. She cursed the universe and everything in it for putting her in this situation. There was a sudden crash, and Adelaide spun around to see Rourke and Emmerick fast roping onto the catwalks high above from a busted ventilation shaft, while Danis and Skye breached through a wall on the ground floor beneath them. Adelaide grabbed Sam and pulled him out of the lubricant. Under distracting gunfire, she led him through the rusted wreckage of a half built Destroyer, lying in pieces across the dock. As they weaved through the debris, she caught a clear line of sight to Emmerick, who was scanning the room for her. She pulled out her pistol and fired three shots, hitting his leg. She proceeded to fire a few more shots at Danis and Skye, while Sam retreated further into the dock. Gradually, Adelaide was pushed back until the only place left to go was into the ocean. She took cover with Sam behind a giant chunk of broken sea wall, knee deep in the water and checked her remaining ammo. They both knew this was the end of the line for Sam. \" Give it up, Adelaide.\" Danis shouted. There was a hint of sorrow in his voice, and Adelaide remembered that he was Sam's friend, too. \" Please... Let's just... Get this over with...\" Sam stood up and walked out of cover. He wanted to say something, but he could n't find the words. He met eyes with Danis and began to cry, which made Adelaide cry. For the first time since'the fracture', Adelaide let her emotions beat her. \" We need him, Sam...\" Danis finally said. \" He's the only one that can destroy her... For good...\" Sam, still unable to talk simply nodded, and fell to his knees. \" Wait!\" Adelaide shouted just as Danis was preparing to shoot. Skye and Rourke lined her up in their sights. Adelaide stared them down, unintimidated. \"... I'll do it.\" She knelt down before Sam and rested her forehead on his. \" I wish...\" She sobbed. \" I wish things were different...\" \" I do n't\" Sam replied softly. \" If things were different... If'He'was n't inside me... We'd never have held off the hoard in India... Never have broken the siege of Seoul... Never been caught in the panic at Okinawa... You'd never have been sent to rescue me... We'd never have met\" He felt Adelaide put her arms around him, and their lips met. Davis and Skye averted their gaze. \" This *is* the only way.\" Sam whispered. \" I know...\" Adelaide replied. \"... I love you.\" A single shot echoed through the underground dock. Adelaide felt Sam go limp, dropped her pistol, and lowered him gently sideways into the shallow water, and allowed herself to weep. After a few minutes had passed, she felt Sam's body stir. She stood up and waited. Then Sam's body stood up beside her. \" You had better be all that humanity hopes you to be, and then some you piece of shit.\" She whispered.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The drink burned, like all off-world moonshine, but he grimaced and forced it down. His synth-arette smoldered in a cheap plastic ash tray beside him. * \" When I hear that thruster hummin', I hang my head and cry. \" * It was a busy night at the Broken Robot Tavern, vagabonds and mercenaries rubbing shoulders with merchants and sailors, all drowning out the aches of another day on the Frontier. Smoke from a dozen different stimulants mingled in the stuffy air, tainted by the unmistakable stenches of body odor, engine grease and cheap liquor. It was Guerro's kind of place. * \" I bet there's rich folk's sailin'on a fancy pleasure craft… \" * He cast a sidelong glance, catching Jaqueline's eye as she mingled through the throngs, like a tiger on the prowl. She was new, green to the core, but damn she knew her way around a crowd. A drunken deckhand beside him belched, laughed, farted, laughed harder, and slapped Guerro on the back. \" Shure ish a great plashe, huh bub? \" Guerro ignored him and signaled the bartender for a refill. * \" They're probably drinkin coffee, and smoking real cigars… \" * He watched Jaqueline stop amid the crowd, look his way, and nod. The bartender slid another greasy glass of gin across the bar, but Guerro ignored it, tossed over a disposable credit chip, and rose from his stool. Beside him, the deckhand's puffy head hit the bar. * \" But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free… \" * Jaqueline was gone, vanished deep into the crowd. Guerro threaded his way through the drunken patrons, dodging enthusiastic elbows and blurry-eyed swings. He caught a glimpse of her died-green hair, then she was gone again in the sea of inebriants. He beelined. * \" But those people keep on sailin', and that's what tortures me. \" * And then there she was, staring daggers. Guerro followed her gaze to a fat man wearing the traditional blue jumpsuit of the UN Peacekeepers. Shit. He slid up beside her. \" He's a cop? \" Guerro muttered under his breath. Jaqueline shook her head, \" nope, but who knows where he got that jumper. That's definitely our guy though, check the scar. \" Indeed, the man bore a long, vicious scar from ear to lip, matching the mug shot on file.'Good, let's go, \" Guerro replied. * \" Well if they freed my from this hellhole, if that pleasure craft was mine… \" * Like a well-oiled machine the pair split up and surrounded the scarred man. He was deep in his cups, judging by his exuberant gestures and booming laugh, and was telling a story of hard-won valor to a group of equally-drunk sailors. Guerro tapped him on the shoulder. * \" I bet I'd fly out over a little farther down the line… \" * The man turned a glassy-eyed gaze his way. He stank of sweat and whisky. \" Washup, my good man? \" Guerro cleared his throat. \" Uh, sir, we have an urgent matter that needs your… immediate attention. \" And suddenly the drunken stare, the slurred words, the boisterous guffaw, disappeared. The man glared at the captain, then at Jaqueline, took a deep breath, and bolted for the door. * \" Far from Farreach Prison, that's where I want to stay… \" * He ran with surprising agility for a man of his size. Guerro followed close on his heels while Jaqueline peeled off at an angle. The crowd was dense, and the captain lowered his shoulder as he plowed ahead in the scarred man's wake. Drinks and protests exploded around him. And then he was out, clearing the tavern and bursting into the night air. He watched as the man turned into an alley. But Jaqueline was there, tackling the man at full speed, the two crashing into a pile of detritus. * \" And I'd let that lonesome thruster… \" * Jaqueline was kneeling on the man's back, lashing his hands together. Guerro strode over, watching with admiration as she deftly secured their bounty. \" God, why do they always run?

Guerro replied with a boot to the nose. * \" Fly my blues away. \" *", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I was in a hurry to get the package ( a heart meant for transplant ) to central state hospital to say I was speeding was an understatement. It had been a routine delivery when the man appeared in my back seat. When I saw him I felt a chill pierce me to the bone; then he said in the most lifeless voice I've ever heard \"\" Your time has come\". In a panic I swerved the car off the road. Now I'm here but where was here? I was in the empty grassy field I'd been driving by for an hour. As I looked around I could n't see anyone or sign of nearby civilization. That's when I saw my car wrapped around the only tree in the entire field. Believing I was in shock due to my lack of pain I tried to breath deeply and that's when I first noticed the smell; something awful; a smell so foul that the moment it touched my tongue I met the half digested version of my Wendy's chicken sandwich I had for lunch. \" What the fuck is that\"! I yelled and stood up and gave the field another cursory glance to check for passers by. Realizing I was physically unharmed I began to walk to my car. As I came closer to what was once a Ford Fusion ( and company car I might add; so good bye job security ) the smell got more and more intense. Once more the air felt cold and still the closer I got to the tree. Once I was close enough to see into the car I could make out a figure in the rear window. \" Hello?!\" I shouted with immediate regret. A chilling voice replied from the car\" Hel...... help\". It was the man in the cloak! I quickly approached the window; his head was laying limp though broken glass. \" Can you move?\" I asked. \" I believe my back is broken.\" The man said very calmly. I looked in the car behind him and I saw one of his legs pinched by some of the other door and the tree. In the seat beside him was a small medical bag and a large cane scythe broken in half. \" Grab the blade son!\" the man exclaimed; and at that moment the cars engine caught fire! \" What the hell of I need the blade for!\" I screamed. Cut the foot and get me out of here; I do not need it anymore\" The man told me calmly. I grabbed the blade and with one upward motion I severed the leg. I grabbed the man under his shoulders and pulled him from the car; when he landed on top of me I saw his face for the first time. He was ancient the oldest man I'd probably ever seen. His eyebrows were all but gone what hair he had on his head was almost clear his teeth were all but rotten but seemed to be sharper for some reason as if filed to a point for some reason; and his eyes were so milky white I could see my own reflection in them. \" Your fucking blind!\" I yelled \" GET MY BAG!\" He yelled; with that soul reaching voice of his! I ran back to the car and grabbed the bag from the back seat; the fire was getting worse now for some reason it seemed to be angry almost alive at the speed it was burning the car to ash. Then just as I'm reaching where I left the now one legged blind old man the car erupts into a massive fire ball! \" Holy shit!\" I yelled as I jumped past the old man; dropping his bag on the ground. I dropped to my knees beside the old bastard and looked at him with disgust and he slowly turned to me and said \" congratulations you have cheated death.\" \" Cheated death?! Yeah we both did but this is n't the time for ill placed idioms what the fuck were you doing in my back seat!?\" \" It was your time Michael\" he said still looking at me as if he was looking to my soul. \" My time? What the hell is that supposed to mean?\" \" It was your time to die I came to take you to the afterlife\" he explained \" today was your day you were supposed to die in that crash but you did n't; and then you came back to save my life. You saved my life as I was about to take yours. I have decided to spare you.\" \" So your trying to tell me your death and you come to kill me but your giving me a free pass? \" I said with disbelief. \" Yes my son\" the one legged death replied. \" Prove it!\" I demanded \" prove your death!\" \" Look into your heart you know it to be true\" the man said softly. \" Is... are you quoting Star Wars!\" I yelled angrily! \" No no I used that phrase before they did I'm much much much older older than time itself\" the man said in a worried tone \" oh no I'm calling bullshit on all of this let me see what's in the bag!\" \" No it's just stuff I need to do my job! Death stuff!\" The man sputtered clutching the bag to his chest. \" Give it here!\" I yelled as I wrenched the bag from his hands. He tried to chase me once I had the bag but he ca n't walk like he used to. When I was a few big steps away from him I undid the clasp on the top and pulled open the flap. All I saw was two needles three balls of something wrapped in tin foil and one crack pipe and lighter. \" Give me back my supplies!\" The man yelled \" fuck off junkie!\" I yelled back \" you were just high this whole time!\" \" I need it to preform my ancient task!\" \" Alright I'm done playing\" I said as I walked away dumping the contents of his bag on the ground. \" Wait! You ca n't leave me! I spared you! I sparredddd youuuu!\" He screeched as I walked away. \" I am so moving the fuck out of Florida as soon as possible\" I muttered to myself as I walked in the direction of the last gas station I saw \" God damn Florida\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It was a life full of sleepless nights, a life full of restless days. I hurt people... I hurt myself. There was nothing more I wanted than to let it go... \" But it is n't for me! You know how hard I have tried! But it's like a cancer on my soul, and every time I think it's gone it comes back stronger.\" I have to sit down. I had ignored the problem for a while now, and I was not prepared to deal with it today. I felt weak, I suppose I am in this regard, but that is just too hard of a pill to swallow somedays. I put my face into my hands, it's not long before they're slick with tears and snot. \" I'm scared... that if I fight again and I do n't kill it... it'll kill me instead.\" I feel him sit next to me. He is so close to me, yet he says nothing so it feels like he's forever away. I hate it, I just want him to say something. Agree, disagree, console, scold... anything! \" You're forgetting something.\" That was it? That's all he is going to say?! I look up at him waiting for an explanation, to see he had tears strolling down his own face. He was as much afected by my suffering as I was, if not more. \" You're forgetting what I did for you. I did n't just deliver you from your past self, I defeated it. Think about it, how could there be a new self unless the old one passed? You're struggling with something that's already dead. It ca n't hurt you, but you can. You're beating yourself with a corpse. And it hurts me so, because I love you. So please... Let it go.\" I took in a huge breath of air quick, then threw my arms around him. I put all my weight unto him, if he did n't support me I'd fall flat on my face. But he did, and I felt him put his arms around me. I felt something snap inside, and then it fell off. It was the chain, I was free.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Have n't been home in ages. Canada's nice in comparison I tell you. I figured I was somewhere in Arizona, or Mexico, or Texas or some shit. Death Valley in Colorado was a decent guess. Actually, Colorado feels like the best guess. It was hot as hell, and the tumble weeds and prickly bushes made for an unsightly landscape. In the distance, a mighty mountain range jutted up into the sky purple and majestic. And- Shit. That's not snow. That's sand. Motherfucker. There was a nearby sign up ahead, and reading it said that I was in Wyoming of all places. Huh. No wonder no one ever comes here. **Floom** Well, it was n't raining. That's the good news. The sky was cloudy as fuck though. I'm surrounded by forest, and a dense fog, with some blue buildings off to the side. There's a crosswalk connecting the road to the two sides of the the forest. Figure I'm in some national park. With all the spruce trees and greenery I think about home. That's Banff, in Alberta for all you Yanks.

The town was modernized, that was good. There were a few cars lying in driveways, but the houses were rural styled. Walking a bit I found a bus stop. Most towns do n't have bus stops so I guess I ended up in a suburb somehow. Shit. Some old guy in a red jacket was walking his dog in the distance. What was disorienting, was that the village was a storybook village. If you catch my drift. It looked like it had been taken right out of 15th century Ukraine and plopped down in modern times or some shit. Ukraine.... Motherfucker. No, not Ukraine. I knew a bit of Ukrainian thanks to my ancestry. No, it was some other eastern European language... Latvian. That was it. I was in fucking Latvia. It would explain the stlye of buildings. Also, one of the more quaint ones had the words *APTIEKA*, which according to a quick google translate, meant *Pharmacy*. The community must have been close knit, because the guy walking the dog started to yell and point in my direction. I heard sirens. Shit. Not the first time, wo n't be the last. **Floom** The first thing I saw were trailers. Like camping trailers. It was dusty as fuck. Probably because of the semi roaring into a nearby yard. Looked like a gas tanker. The smell was putrid. The rest of the landscape was red Toyota and prairie for miles. Farm country. Say it with me... Motherfucker. Finally, after walking around the perimeter, I discovered that although a confined and less than fortunate farming colony, it was beside Reagan County school. Which made me beleive that I was somewhere near Reagan County. Think that's in Texas. Motherfucker. **Foom** Did n't really register this one. I was hit by a car as I flew in and woke up in the hospital. In fucking Washington.

No, things have n't changed much in fifty years. Our focus may have turned away from reality a touch and we may focus on our virtual existences and forms of communication more than before, but all that alienation and awkward moments at live parties has been more than worth it for a near-limitless stream of information available to anybody at anytime.

The huts walls were lined with candy canes, the awning had some fake cotton snow on it. It looked like a professionally decorated house during the holidays. He walked over to the hut, and was hit with a wall of a overwhelmingly horrible stench. He slowly crept up to the window of the house, looked inside, and saw nothing but a dark room. He could barely even make out the shapes of objects inside. Wanting to know why this hut was here he walked up and he knocked at the door. Nothing. No movements, no yelling to see who was at the door. So he slowly crept in. The smell was just horrible, it smelled like something had died in there. He fumbled around looking for some sort of light he could switch on. Finally he found a candle on a table close to the door with a box of matches next to it. He lit it up and saw the source of the smell. A body lie in a recliner. It was an old man, fat and bearded. His beard was as white and pure except for at the top, it was mixed with a deep red. He looked at the face of the man, if you could call what was left a face. He gagged as he saw where the hole had pretty much destroyed the man's face. He looked over to the side and saw a note. The note read: I'm sorry, the pressure was to much, I ca n't deliver the presents to all the kids anymore. People are getting to overly cautious and I've been shot at, bitten by animals, and countless other things. Not only that but kids do n't believe like they used to, and are getting greedy.

Each gust of wind sends a shaky rustle through the trees around me - a prickly chill runs down your back. Trying to make sense of the day, again. Tired of this job. This house. This damn weather. Another drag, longer this time. Exhale. Hearing the CLACK CLACK of branches rap against the upstairs window. Wind's picking up, I guess. The usual sound of the frogs and insects this time of night is slowly dying as the days go on. I feel the same way, crickets. My lungs are warm, everything else, cold. CLACK CLACK of the branches overhead. Standing up, I'm walking over to the edge of the yard. To the tree line of tall pines standing guard. I take a drag as I arrive. Cig's out. Toss it away. The butt lands past a mighty fir. Under the dark of the canopy the spray of embers casts a quick flash of… what is it? A mashing of red and white. All I can see. Was n't there yesterday. I pull out my phone, start up a flashlight app. The woods turn an eerie blue white. Dark, crimson red over a white carcass. Stepping on some branches as I move forward - CLACK CLACK. Looks like a cat. Was white. Gut sprawled open. Most of the insides missing. Poor thing probably had a run in with one of the local coyotes. Shit happens. Survival. I feel you, cat. CLACK CLACK I spin around, the snap of a branch startling me from behind. Light from my phone catches something - a flash that darts out of my sight in no time. What is it? I step forward. Careful to tune my ear to the sound of movement, I try to avoid stepping on the twigs and sticks lining the ground. Shake my head as I fail. To the right, the dart of movement. I freeze. Slowly tilt my hand to shine the light on it. I see nothing. Change of plan - lights out. Pocket my phone. My eyes start to adjust to the darkness under the trees. I take a step. CLACK CLACK. Then a different noise. A screech. A silhouette just past the trees. Not too large. What is it? I take another step, careful to avoid snapping twigs. Success. Another step, stopping against a tree, peering out the left side… There it is. There it is! Escaped the other day. Saw it in the news. The one from the park. Short velociraptor from the city. Not too big. Million dollar reward. Not too big. My lucky break. Heart racing - scanning the yard. One mil. No more bullshit. Finally I can get out of here. Move wherever the hell I want. My lucky break. My weight shifts a bit. CLACK. The raptor's head turns to face me. Curious, it cock's it's head to the side and hops a step toward me. I hide behind the tree. A thumping sound, almost a visceral purr. I hear it step through the grass closer to me. Hear it stop a few feet from the other side of the tree. The wind dies. Silence. Hear my own heart beat. Waiting. Still… silence. I slowly lean to my right, catch a glance of my yard. Nothing there. Fuck. I pull my phone out. Flashlight. Nothing. Light off. Fucking kidding me? I turn back, sitting against the side of the tree. Next to me. Raptor. DAMN! Silent little fucker! Teeth red. Face red. Feet red. Guessing I know what got the cat. I do n't move. Trying to breath slowly. But heavy. Raptor looks at me, sniffing. Red. I back up to the tree. Ca n't move anymore. Red. Not good. How do I catch this thing. A growl? Not sure. Red. Does n't sound good. Raptor moves a bit closer. Another sniff. Licking it's chops. I try to stand up. SCREEEECCHHHH. Go back down. Damn. Shaking now. Sharp teeth. Red. I pull out the pack of cigarettes. Might as well. Maybe it does n't like the smoke. Quick light. Watching me do it. Raptor steps back. Sits on a rock. The fuck? I take a drag, let it go in a big cloud of smoke. Baritone voice - \" Hey, can you bum one. I've been dry for weeks.\" Raptor just talked. I'm losing my mind. Drop the cig of out my mouth. Wide mouth. Probably looked like and idiot. Reach into my pocket and pull out the pack. Hold it out. Raptor grabs the pack, pulls out a dart. \" You got ta light?\" Eyes wide, I hold out the lighter. CLICK. SIZZLE. BURN. IN. OUT. \" Thanks, baby.\" Raptor sits cross-legged. Takes a drag. I light up another. Lost my first one… \" Now, I'm sure you know,\" begins Raptor. Takes another drag and exhales before continuing. \" that I am a wanted muthafukka. You know that, right?\" I nod. Twice, just to be sure it sees me. Drag. \" Now, I can tell a muthafukka by lookin'at em that he's a muthafukka. You fit that diagnosis.\" Not sure where Raptor's going with this. I listen. Drag. \" I can tell you think I'm just a tiny ole'harmless lizard with a million dollar mark on my head. You follow?\" Still not sure what drugs I've done. I nod. Twice. \" Well you saw Mr. Bigglesworth. Right? I know you saw what I had to do to someone who tried to get that money. You follow?\" I look past Raptor to the red-white pile not too far away. Missing guts. Fur on the ground. Lot of red. I nod. Eyes hurt from being so wide. Drag. Raptor exhales. Blow it in my face. \" There's things I got ta do to those who snitch. And I hate snitches. You gon na snitch?\" Drag drag. Shake head. Lot of shakes. Make sure Raptor sees. Raptor takes last drag. Blows smoke in a steady stream into my face. \" Well let's hope you ai n't the muthafukka I thought you are. You follow?\" Nod nod. \" Good. I'll be watching you. Just remember - Mr. Bigglesworth.\" Raptor throws butt at me. A yelp as I try to brush the burning off. CLACK CLACK through the woods. Did n't even see him bolt. I glance around - no Raptor in sight.

{"input": "Everyone is assigned a guardian angel who helps them out through life, however due to a clerical error a demon was assigned to you.", "output": "With shaking hands, Sarah unbuckled her seatbelt and opened her door to step out onto the highway. Her vehicle was untouched, but surrounded by the smoking wreckage of a twenty-car pile-up. An eighteen-wheeler and a cement mixer lay on their sides, lumber and wet cement strewn across the highway, crumpled vehicles swept into a jagged heap between them. Traffic in the opposing lanes had come to a standstill. Beneath the rumble of the engines, the blaring of horns, the wail of incoming ambulances, there was a softer, more terrifying sound. Weak cries of agony drifted from one of the crushed vehicles. \" Fuckin'hell. That was a close one. \" Yequon appeared beside her. For the last week, he'd been inhabiting a 25-year-old competitive triathlete who'd drowned in a river. The abs were spectacular, but the smell was awful. \" What is wrong with you? \" Sarah snarled at him, but didn't wait for answer. She sprinted to the nearest vehicle, crouching to check the crushed interior. There was nothing to be done for the pulpy mess inside. She turned away and fell to her hands and knees, stomach heaving as she spat up thin, sharp bile. Yequon moseyed up behind her. \" Thank you, Yequon, \" he prompted. \" You saved my life, Yequon. You're the greatest guardi— \" \" Jesus Christ, \" Sarah snapped. Yequon hissed, falling back as if he'd been punched. \" That was ungrateful, \" he said, rubbing his ears. \" I *am* ungrateful. I don't want you. I'd rather have no guardian at all. \" Sarah got to her feet, and moved weakly to the next vehicle. In the distance, sirens wailed. They couldn't get near her. The accident formed a halo of destruction, and she stood in the center. When the lumber truck sideswiped the cement mixer, she should've been the only casualty. It took her a minute to work up the nerve to look into the next vehicle. \" If you had no guardian at all, you'd be dead a hundred times over. \" \" I only have to die once, \" she told him, almost wistful. She thought of the near-misses that had peppered her life – each accident with a wider circumference of devastation than the last. When she was six, she nearly drowned in a rip tide. And then, suddenly, the current changed, spitting Sarah up on the beach, while three other children were dragged to their deaths. \" You never have to die, \" Yequon said. When she was thirteen, an untended, late-night leaf fire in the neighbor's yard started the house on fire. The fire spread so quickly, every house in the neighborhood was razed to the ground within a couple hours. Except Sarah's. \" How can you accept killing dozens of other people to save just one? \" She took a breath and peered into what might've once been a pickup truck, then immediately recoiled from it, moving on. Yequon shrugged, unperturbed. \" It's my job to save *you* – not those other dozens. \" When she was eighteen, her would-be rapist was shot dead by a random bullet from a drive-by shooting. Ten other people in her building were struck, seven killed. Sarah was untouched. Again and again, throughout her life, when danger and tragedy befell her, Yequon snatched it away and pushed it tenfold onto those around her. Sarah straightened abruptly, turning to stare at the demon. \" What are you still doing here? I'm saved. Why are you hanging around? \" \" Job's not done yet. \" Cold dread squeezed her lungs. Sarah turned her back on the demon, making her way unsteadily to the next vehicle. More death. That's what it always was with him. Her life had become a sequence of tragedies, and her continued existence was a threat to everybody she knew. In a flash of purpose, Sarah bent down, picking up the largest vane of glass she could find, and held the jagged edge to her throat. \" Are you allowed to save me from myself, demon? \" She blinked, and Yequon was behind her, his cold, waxen hand closing over hers, the scent of corpse rot filling her nose. At his touch, the glass dissolved into sand. \" Now the job's done, \" Yequon said, a smirk in his voice. \" For today. \" And then he was gone.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The elves and I all had do duck a little, but Jacob and Mark were short enough not to have an issue. \" Then you smash the door, archer man.\" Neri said, dissmissively as she set the sandstone block on the ground behind us, ducking her horned head beneath it as it approached the ground. \" I'm not touching these carvings.\" \" What do you think this area's for?\" I asked aloud, ending the bickering as much as possible. The question was to Neri mostly, architecture and artifacts were her area of expertise, but the others, as usual, had their own insights as we entered a large, circular, cavernous room of sandstone and marble, filled with layers of fine, tan power eroded slowly from the sandstone, intended to bury the place over time. That that system had failed was what made this place unique, or at least a rare chance for us to find good loot for a lot less work, even if some of it would n't be as well preserved. \" The door was obviously not practical for normal, regular use.\" Sharli began all of our voices echoing slightly in the hall, \" but it does n't look ornamental or fancy enough for a crypt.\" \" Not to mention that that's more of a First Empire thing, the Second, they worshipped Heorath first and foremost, so cremations were pretty standard.\" Semmel continued \" This place seems pretty austere, for that kind of sealed entrance. Think it's already been looted?\" \" Not with that many spider nests outside it has n't.\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \" Those things take *centuries* to settle in in those numbers, and that queen was at least six hundred years old to get that size. Nobody came through the way we did for a long damn time.\" \" This place has been abandoned for a long damn time.\" I said. \" They could've been cleared out a thousand years ago and re-populated it before we came through for all we know.\" \" Or the place could've been like this originally.\" Neri interjected. \" I do n't see any huge gaps that look like the place has been looted.\" \" It's a temple.\" Mark noted, and I cast my gaze over to the young healer. \" We ca n't make that kind of assumption yet.\" Sharli dismissed him. \" It does n't look like any of the Second Empire temples I've ever-\" \" Look up.\" And Mark pointed so we could all see the massive, domed roof above the floor we stood on, and to the grand, hanging brazier above, shaped like a sun, circular with curving, sword-like tendrils radiating out in all directions. More interesting, though, was the symbol imprinted in the center of the bronze circle. twin arcs, indented into the metal, connected at the ends with circles for Iris and pupil in the center. A staring eye. \" The sun would symbolize Heorath...\" Semmel noted, staring up at it \" But what about that eye?\" \" The Brazier does n't mean it has to be a temple\" Sharli continued to object \" The Second Empire put the gods'symbols, particularly Heorath's, on most things they crafted, and the roof-\" \" Sharli, I've been in enough temples to know what they feel like.\" Mark said, dryly. \" Do you know if they were the types to make temples ostentation as hell, or more simple, monastic-like?\" \" I've got to side with Mark on this one.\" Neri said \" This might be a monastery of some sort, not a place of general worship, that'd need a practical door. Something they'd be okay with sealing off from the outside world most of the time.\" \" We have no evidence of a monastic tradition in the second empire.\" Sharli said \" Did n't you just say you've never seen anything like this?\" Mark turned his gaze back down to the open floor we stood on, and crouched to the ground to look at the floor, buried in a few inches of dusty sand. \" Looks like a mosiac of some sort for the floor.\" He said, clearing away a patch of sand, and staring at it. \" Semmel, come look at this. It's a scene of some sort.\" \" Let me see.\" Semmel rushed over and began clearing more sand away, his curiosity boundless as always while I began searching for other rooms. There appeared to be four hallways out from this central room, each leading to a single other room, but no extensive labyrinths, at least, nothing obvious from here. \" This is n't a huge complex, how much of a monastary could it really be?\" I asked Neri, as she continued staring high toward the domed roof of the main room. \" There probably is n't facilities for more than, what, a half dozen monks?\" \" And yet they had their own structure, austere, but not small, with honors to Heorath above, front and center...\" Neri started brainstorming \" And that eye.\" \" And that eye.\" I repeated. \" Any guess what it means? Seen anything like it before?\" Neri stayed silent for awhile, staring at the patterns on the sandstone columns. \" In a book, a few years back.\" She said finally. \" The design was more intricate, but this site is older, it could've been a later version.\" \" What was it?\" \" The Oracle at Kelphine, to the North. They used an eye with lines radiating out, with some more intricate symbols for knowledge in the pupil as her symbol for a thousand years there. Under the Landfall states, not that long after this empire fell apart.\" I looked around again, at the marble and sandstone, and the cavernous open room. It did look like somewhere you could have audiences with a priest, or a prophet. \" You think this is the temple of an Oracle?\" \" It's possible.\" Neri shrugged her massive, shaggy shoulders, her bulls'nostrils flaring in a small snort. \" Helluva find if it is.\" \" Malcom.\" I heard Mark call my name. \" You're gon na want to see this.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I picked up the phone and checked time with squinted and sleepy eyes. 5:55 A.M., an hour and five minutes before the alarm. And one text message, sent to me a minute ago. Who in the hell messages someone 5 o'clock in the morning? To be honest, it was almost six, but it was still early in the morning. I grumbled as I opened the text. *It's not real. None of it. Trust no one. Escape. * 5:54 AM I read it again, but it said what exactly it said when I read it first time. \" The hell...?\" I raised myself and sat on my bed and thought about it. Well, there was n't much to think about it other than being weird. So I replied to the text: *Who's this? * 5:56 AM The phone ringed once and notified me that it failed to send my text message. I checked the number which the mysterious text was from. An Unidentified Number, it said. Strange, I thought, even scammer's numbers show up on the phone nowadays. Then, I saw David's smirking face lingering on my still sleepy blurry vision. Ha. Ha. Very funny, David. What a prank. I figured he paid like $ 0.99 to download some sort of prank call app just to mess with my head for a second. The timing and the style of the text... it all made sense. I deleted the text message. I planned on playing dumb if David brought up this incident. No, no, no... I have n't received any strange message... What are you talking about... The frustrated face of David in my imagination amused me. I got out of my bed and felt thirsty. I decided to get a glass of water and then go back to sleep. I left the room thinking if I stayed awake, this will be the first time in the history of our family that I would be the first one to rise. There were still thirty minutes to go before mom and dad's alarm went off. Maybe I should stay awake, I wondered. To my surprise, when I opened the door of my room, both mom and dad and even Annie, my little sister, were lined up facing my room, each with a slight frown on their faces. In fact, they were all dressed up like they were about to go to the church! It was only Wednesday, as far as I recalled. Also, I never saw Annie make that kind of face before. Something was up and something was wrong. Was I in a trouble? \" Good morning...\" I spoke in a faint voice. My mom crossed her arms and asked: \" You did n't see anything strange this morning, did you?\" \" No, ma'am. I did n't.\" I replied. I did saw something strange this morning, but it came out as some sort of a knee-jerk reaction to her question. I lied, yes, but I did n't mean to. But now that I denied of seeing anything strange, I had to keep my fib. Otherwise, I'd be punished for dishonesty. Dad walked toward me and grabbed my shoulder. \" Let me see your phone.\" He reached for my pocket and took out my phone. He opened it up, and checked voicemail, text message, and e-mail respectively. Obviously I had deleted the text, so he found nothing, but it terrified me. What was going on? Why was my dad, who's known to be too-kind-he's-dumb, making that grimace? As soon as my dad ransacked through the phone and declared that he found nothing, the frowns vanished away from their faces. \" Oh, you know... checking.\" My mother said. Which was the weirdest part of the morning. She never hid anything from me before. In fact, she talked way too much about what she thought about anything. But *you know, checking*? Checking what? They were acting suspicious and I knew it and they knew I knew they appeared suspicious. \" Why did you waking up so early in the morning?\" Dad asked. \" I woke up because I was thirsty. I was gon na get some water.\" \" Good.\" He replied. And then, along with mom, he walked back into the master bedroom. Annie walked toward her own bedroom too. I wanted to stop her and ask her what was the deal with the confrontation this early in the morning, but she felt so distant and estranged. I had a feeling that she was n't going to be honest with me. They went to their rooms, and slammed shut their doors. I pretended to get a cup for water, but after I made sure they were inside I raised my heels and approached to the master bedroom. I pressed my ear against the door and eavesdropped whatever I could. There was some muffled mumbling behind the wooden door, but I could n't make much out of it. But I still managed to catch some important words: \"... ed. No, sir. He...\" It was my dad's voice. Sir? Surely my father was n't talking to my mother. My mother would n't say *sir* to my dad either. As far as my imagination went, he was reporting the lack of any evidence that I saw anything strange this morning. But to whom? Who was he talking to? More and more questions bubbled up. \"... Hold on, sir.\" I clearly heard that and felt footsteps approaching toward me behind the door. I jumped back from the door and pretended I was slumping to my bedroom with a glass of water on my hand. When I opened my bedroom door halfway, the door to the master bedroom kicked open and the spying eyes of my dad daggered through me. I turned back and shrugged and nonchalantly asked: \" What?\" \" Nothing.\" He said and walked back into his room. I closed the door behind me and jumped onto my bed. I could feel the heat rising on my face. My heart was pumping and thumping I could feel the pulse running all over my body. What the hell? What was happening? What was the message? I was having a mild panic attack. Then, *Ding! * A text message from An Unidentified Number. I placed my finger on my phone, but for a moment I pondered. If I opened it up, I may or may not regret it for the rest of my life. I could never get to have normal life after this point. If I just ignore it, it might just go away. But then again, I'd be blinded from truth. I slid my finger across and opened the text message.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

It must have been love; people often say that the good things in life are presented to those who believe, so I chose to trust that. It was 1957 when I first saw you and it was love that made me want to stay in this space. Beatriz, with your brown leather purse, short heel shoes and Sunday dress. You sat there in the heat of that day, waiting on the fans of the next locomotive. The people in this town spoke of a man whom once stopped time for you. Your heart was like a flourishing flower breaking through the concrete jungle, dying for you would have been easy to manage. Yet, how could I tell you I wanted to explore you, to feel your life, to have you feel how I floated with cannonballs because my love weighed me down? Now I know you are leaving, I know at this moment you would rather leave that bench, leaving my heart shackled to this courtyard. I wish for you to know that my love transcends time and only belongs to one person. Yet I do not know where you are headed, and it is only you, just you. It all seemed like a dream because I knew that this would reach its inevitable end, and I would have no choice but to forget. I wished in every instant that I could change, wished to stay. I used to think there were certain things that would allow us to stretch this \" what if \" into a series of moments only define by home, because that is where the heart resides. You see Beatriz, as a man walks through his life he will reach his journey's end, yet with a woman like you at his side, it would have only marked the beginning. An empirical force, or the voice of your anima would bring the two of you together. I can not help the notion; if I were not forced to disregard this, if I were to act on the desire of this moment, a piece of me would drift away with you. I never expected to find an emotion like this, that unadorned my smile; a love that I must let go. I will remember walking the desolate streets, wishing to scream out the love I held for you. I wanted everyone to know that this grand moment that humans search for had touched the shores of the beach that is my heart. Everything changed in my life from the very first moment the sight of you inhabited my field of view. You should know that these eyes, the windows to my soul, could only show how infectious you were to me. You should know that the happiness of having you would be a love song for the centuries. Life has been a mystery since I knew of you, because without you the shadows of the night overwhelmed me. In the early morning, you have been a bird's symphony in my illusion, something that I can only understand when I hear the violin that is your voice. Together, we were one and much more than two. Loving your smile, your laugh, you face, the quiddity of your stare. I would have never traded you for anything. For just a few moments on that beautiful afternoon, the happiness of speaking with you baptized me and I truly began to live. I watched everyday at around this time, and it became a custom for me to wait for the arrival of your soft skin. The hours flew by like my thoughts and intrigue, just as the days did. A million opportunities to stay flew on, but I'd already taken a liking to the lingering. My blood turned to honey when I saw you as beautiful as the last time, when I looked closer as I approached you, I saw you even more beautiful. Sure it was weird or maybe different, but in you I saw things, my love. In you I saw lights I would never see, doubts I would never know, simplicities that I could not comprehend. Your voice healed me, lightened me; and yet I could not do anything. Beatriz, you were the energy that charged me, the verb that gave action to the conversations of life; I wished to be the tree that shaded you that day in April. You were the serenity that I found in meditation; I wanted to conquer life. Our vibrations complimented one another; I will always miss what you had. I love you because you had so many things that made me feel like I wanted to be the white sand that blanketed your beach, the landscape that brought life to your map. You were a dose of hope. I chose to exist in that space for the pledge of eternity, and I believed in that promise. *Love, * Phillip. *THE TIME TRAVELER*", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

That day had n't been the best day of my life, and it just so happened that it had been my last. At precisely 2:23pm and 37 seconds past, after burning my hands on overcooked fried chicken, I was hit by three falling beer barrels that had rolled off of a Heineken truck, of course, Heineken was my favourite beer, and as I sat underneath those barrels, bleeding and being crushed, I found that I could n't even reach the taps. 8 minutes and 16 seconds later, everything had begun to fade, paramedics were rushing around, but they'd only just arrived, people were screaming, and some stupid chihuahua was barking its head off- I hate those tiny rat-dogs. Some time later, I awoke in a bed, at least, I'd been lying on something. I would n't have called it a bed as such though, because it was made from rocks; so perhaps not an NHS hospital bed. I groggily sat up and blinked hard, rubbing the sleep out of my eyes and taking in my surroundings. In an instant, I knew exactly where I was; the same stalagmites and stalactites; the same dusty air; the same- perhaps the dripping was new, but it was definitely Chislehurst caves. I remembered visiting hospital shortly after a school trip here, Tim Greene had thrown a rock at the ceiling, and it had caused a stalactite to fall off the ceiling and go through my left foot. Tim had n't meant to stab me in the foot, but it did hurt like hell, and I had to use crutches for a month. As I walked around, I began to notice several things that seemed out of place. The first of which, was that there seemed to be metal rails bolted in place at quite a few points in what seemed to be a tunnel section; the second of which, was that despite not being able to hear anyone, there seemed to be a general murmur; the third thing, was that I could see everything clearly, despite the absence of any lamps or torches nearby; finally, I realised that I myself was n't panicking- or breathing- and that I could find neither the capacity or gumption to do either. I decided that given what was available to me, the best thing to do, would be to walk onwards. As I was guided along by the rails and the tunnel, I saw a large, bronze looking door at the end of tunnel, with the inscription: \" Per me si va ne la città dolente, per me si va ne l'etterno dolore, per me si va tra la perduta gente. Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore: fecemi la divina potestate, la somma sapienza e'l primo amore. Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create se non etterne, e io etterno duro. Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate\" running around the edge. Having had to miss latin, because of the fact that I had eaten an under-cooked sausage, which had given me acute food poisoning, and meant I had to repeat a year ( which put me in the year that studied home economics instead of latin ); I could n't really read it. A few words jumped out, like divina, etterno, duro, and me, but I do n't think they meant what I thought they did. I turned around, ready to go back and call an ambulance, when I realised that behind me, a large wall had... appeared, I guess; I certainly had n't heard anything anyway. Obviously, the only course of action, was to open the door, and after some thorough handle searching, I located one at the right side at about 3 o'clock. I gave it a tug, and it clicked. I gave it another tug, and there was a rusty scraping. A third tug, and it slid open towards me- nearly backing me into the new wall. As I stepped through, I was greeted by what must have been millions of people waiting in very long cues to various different booths, reminiscent of airport security passport checks. As I began to wonder if I was in the right place, a young man with neat black hair, deathly pale skin, and a clipboard, walked towards me. \" Name?\" the man half asked, half shouted into his clipboard, now going through it with a pencil attached to it by a string. \" James. Jame-James Harvey?\" I asked. \" You do n't seem so sure\" joked the man. \" I am\" I mumbled to myself, but he mus n't have heard it, because he was going through his notes, obviously looking for a James Harvey. \" So where am I?\" I asked, the man held up a finger on the hand that was holding the pencil, and I realised that things would n't be done on my terms. The man had obviously found my name, as he had been looking at it with a scowl, and he was no longer moving the pencil. I tried to walk behind him, but he turned around. I tried to look over, and he tilted the clipboard towards himself. \" What's the problem?\" I asked. He held up his finger once again, and I huffed and folded my arm, then decided it was a waste of time, I had n't had anything planned, and I did n't have any friends to plan anything with, so perhaps I could try to make a start. The man pulled out a radio, pressed the transmit button and began to speak into it, he'd walked away now, and he was telling me to stay back- once again through the use of hand gestures- I therefore did n't hear all of his end, but I picked up small phrases like \" Alan, it's Collin, I think there's a-\" and \" Are you sure\" and \" Fff-, boss is going to be-\" and \" He knows? Oh. So-\" and \" Well, I'll bring him over, treat him like normal right?\". Collin holstered the radio along his belt. \" James, I'd like it if while you were here, you were n't interrupting my business, I'm trying to make things a little faster for you here.\" Collin told me briskly. I was a little taken aback, but given the circumstances, I thought it best to do as he said. \" Come on now James, we have things to do\". As we pushed through the queues, weaving in and out of them to get to one of the booths, I noticed they were n't offering any real resistance- in fact, we seemed to almost go through them. \" What about them?\" I asked Collin; \" would you rather I helped each and every one of them, and then I got to you?\" Collin retorted, getting more and more visibly irritated, I could n't really think of an answer to that, I mean, sure, people should be selfless, but in all honesty, the sheer amount of people waiting in line looked like given Collin's process, things would have taken years. Giving up on me answering Collin added \" I thought not. Now, come along, I still have to sort them out, and I really have n't got all day\". After what had felt like hours of walking through these miles of queues, we reached the booths. A wrinkled old woman was hunched over the desk. \" Collin\" she smiled \" and I see we have a new guest\" she said as she turned to me. I'd never been first in line, and naturally turned to check how many other people I'd just queue jumped. Strangely enough, there was n't a soul in line. Just as well, the quiet chatter was beginning to unnerve me. The old lady laughed and leaned back in her chair. I noticed her name tag on her white blouse \" Alaine\" it read. It had seven black stars underneath it, two black lines in-between, and a white border at the edges; as I took in the details and counted things, I began to calm down again. \" So, name, Mr Harvey?\" she smirked \" Jame- hang on, do n't you already know my name?\". Alaine cackled and then answered \" Always gets'em, and there's not too much fun to be had down here, so take it while we can, is what I say\" she wiped a tear from her eye as she stopped laughing, and smiled at me once again. \" Where exactly is here?\" I asked. At this stage, I did n't really want the answer. \" Did Collin not tell you?\" she tutted at Collin, and put her hand over mine \" do you not know?\" I moved her hand, and asked \" know what?\". \" There's no easy way to say this James, but you're dead\" she said. She smiled sympathetically, and grabbed my hand once again, taking a breath in to say something that was no doubt sympathetic, but probably patronising. \" Well, I knew that some barrels of Heineken landed on me, but dead? With my luck, I suppose it was inevitable\". Alaine laughed \" at least you're not too hung up about it, and before you interrupted, I was about to tell you something you might like to hear.\" I smiled a little. So I was dead. So what.

Prepare for the battle of: Ronald McDonald Vs. The Burger King.", "output": "Though pushback from libertarian groups caused a several-year delay, the law that mandated sweeping new dietary guidelines for all American restaurants passed almost unanimously through the U.S House and Senate on March 26th, 2056. Fried foods - banned. Beef - banned. Soda, trans fats, and added sugar - banned. As headlines on news sites blared \" Obesity Rate Hits 70 %\", opposition to the law had become minimal in the face of a public health crisis. Restaurants adjusted their menus. Commercials shouted about all-you-can-eat salad bars instead of half-pound bacon cheeseburgers, and life went on. A single caveat was added to the law, the biggest compromise that lawmakers were still willing to agree to, to appease the fast food industry. One exception would be made, one relic of Old America would be allowed to stand. But it would have to fight for the privilege. Over two-thirds of the country tuned in as mascots were taken down one by one. The Frisch's Big Boy surrendered immediately, so frightened by the giant vat of boiling cooking oil brought into the arena by Colonel Sanders that he walked out of the arena with wet pants, dejectedly dragging his small burger cannon behind him. Yet the cooking oil was n't enough for Ronald McDonald's grand army of McNugget Buddies that parachuted from the sky with grenades inside each and every one of their tiny, smiling mouths. The Taco Bell chihuahua of old came whimpering back into the limelight, only to be quickly euthanized by the Burger King's flame grill. It was time for the final fight. It made no difference to the audience that the pairing was predictable, it was time for the big guns now. A roar burst out from the audience as *the* Ronald McDonald himself became the first to step into the stadium. A delay of a few minutes and His Royal Highness, The Burger King, came to stand parallel to the fast food clown. He tossed his cape aside, staring through his eternally grinning mask. The horn sounded to start the battle and the rest of the respective teams revealed themselves. A cheerful, long-lashed bird in pink flew around ready to toss hard boiled egg grenades while a large purple creature stood as a barrier between Ronald McDonald and anything seeking to harm him. A redheaded boy in suspicious clothes grinned menacingly below the wide brim of a black hat as he tossed around one of several strange creatures that looked like nothing more than large hairballs, except that their skinny legs and large, staring eyes indicated that they were alive. On the other side of the stadium, the audience was surprised to see nothing more than seven children, one of them in a wheelchair, and a helmet-wearing dog. Two of said children, along with the energetic pup, went to work building a protective moat around the King, but the Hamburglar only laughed, tossing the hairball creatures directly at them. The front rows in the audience gasped as they noticed blades poking out of the bottoms of the hairballs'shoes, but the Fry Kids flailed in the air and missed their mark when one of the other children - a girl with long blonde hair - lifted the camera hanging around her neck and blinded them with abnormally bright flashes. The Hamburglar grimaced at his missed attack, but smiled again as he noticed that one of the children - a sandy-haired and befreckled boy - appeared to be crippled and resigned to a wheelchair. He would be an easy target. McDonald's own caped crusader ran straight for the boy, garnishing from under his long black cape two large Quarter Pounders, one for each hand. Except instead of pickles, these particular burgers were decorated with the sharp, spinning blades of a circular chain saw. One of the children that stood out the most looked like an eclectic miniature Einstein, with his mess of red hair and a pair of purple coke bottle eyeglasses resting on his small nose. He had stood back, not looking like much of an addition to the Burger King's army, but in seeing the Dennis the Menace lookalike move towards his friend, the boy dubbed \" I/Q\" looked down at his oversized wristwatch and calmly pressed a button. The wheelchair came to life immediately, its wheels suddenly expanding to resemble those of a monster truck and the armrests opening up to release sets of long, hidden cylinders. The Hamburglar jumped back, but it was too late, and he felt heat overcome him as he was plunged into lines of fire from the wheelchair's no-longer-hidden flamethrowers. On the other side of the arena, Birdie felt confident as she took on two of the children at once. She gleefully tossed egg bombs from a safe distance in the air at the sporty redheaded girl and the tall black boy with a high top fade, but grew frustrated as they both dodged with athletic agility. What had seemed like a silly attempt at tossing soccer and basketballs at her grew more harrowing as she realized, as one soccer ball flew into a stray Fry Kid, that like her own weapons, their balls were bombs. Ronald McDonald still smiled for the audience, but the smile had a new air of menace as he saw how his team was being challenged by children. He would end this now, he decided, as he saw a path through the distracted fighters that would get him directly to the King himself. The kids in the King's army were fighting well, but they had made a dire mistake. They had left the King unprotected, with the exception of a silly moat of soda pop. The Kid's Club noticed the clown moving alongside his purple guard, but could n't tear themselves away from fighting against the obstacles immediately threatening their lives - a stream of egg bombs, the plague of Fry Kids still leaping to-and-fro with their bladed shoes, the invading McNugget Buddies that had been brought out to fight again. Their resilient Schnauzer stopped gnawing on a limp McNugget and attempted a leap at the fast food harlequin, but was easily swatted away. Ronald McDonald reached the moat, and ordered the purple beast to lay across it, using it's body as a living bridge. Grimace did so, stretching out its arms and laying its hands on the other side, but the second it dipped its large stomach into the soda pop, it let out a painful scream. Ronald McDonald gripped the back of the creature's neck and lifted it up out of the moat, only to toss it aside disgustedly as he saw, overtaking Grimace's stomach, a sizzling, growing, gaping hole. He winced as he realized he had underestimated the children. The moat had n't been filled with soda after all. Ronald McDonald glared at the King, only a few meters away from him yet appearing untouchable. God, how he wanted to crush that smug mask. Where were his McNugget Buddies? Where were his Fry Kids? All of them had seemingly been decimated. The Hamburglar had been flame grilled, Birdie had been baked, and the kids were now coming quickly towards him. In desperation, he reared back, took a deep breath, and leapt. He slipped in the dirt of the stadium floor, and felt a burn as the back of his left shoe dipped into the acid moat and was eviscerated. But he was on the other side. He raced towards the Burger King before the kids could pull another trick out of their sleeve, gripped the King's throat with one hand, and moved to lift off the mask with the other. But it would n't come off. McDonald started in surprise, his focus moved fully towards removing the damned mask, but there was no seam. He took a step back, startled, and stared into the face of his rival as the Burger King stood up. Its mouth slowly lifted at the ends into an even wider grin. The last thing Ronald McDonald felt was the sensation of falling backwards.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Every day as Perry walked by he could hear it. \" Are you mighty enough to-\" yadda yadda yadda. \" only my steel can pierce-\" blah blah etc. for something without human anatomy, it was pretty far up its own ass. A talking sword was cool and all, but who would want one when he's so pretentious? The winter was long and arduous, and Perry's family did all it could just to feed themselves, but the snow was beginning to melt, and the larks were returning. Spring was upon them, and it was good, for his family at least. The slow change in the weather was melting the lake as well an Perry could n't think about anything but what would happen to the sword? The ice he once thought was an enchantment was waning, would a little bit remain? would the sword sink to the bottom of the lake? Could a talking sword drown? These questions and many more kept Perry busy most of his work day, but today was a bit different. The mystical blade was n't spouting his usual bluster. every few minutes he'd just make a concerned \" hmm\" sound. Finally he had to break the silence. \" Are you going to be ok Sword?\" \" What's this? A lowly knave addresses me? Come boy test your strength prove to-\" \" Yea you seem fine\" Perry started on the long walk back home. he slung his satchel over his shoulder. Full of berries he picked on the way down, his family would have their first dessert in months. \" Wait! Wait! I'm sorry I called you a knave. I just- I was supposed to be a legendary sword fit for a hero to slaughter evil and bring the darkness to heel, but I have n't seen any hero. The only person who walks by this God forsaken lake is you. I do n't know if its just a bad location, but the foot traffic in this town is atrocious.\" \" What so all that blathering was to impress me?\" \" A little, Where you in awe at my splendor?\" \" Not particularly. You come on a bit strong. Besides, I do n't know if you heard, but the evil was vanquished a month or 2 ago.\" \" Vanquished? but only my blade is sharp enough to pierce-\" \" There's this fancy invention called armor piercing ammunition, does a pretty good job against dark lords if the daily news can be believed.\" That was the other thing he thought was weird. Guns had been around a long time. Who in their right mind would take a sword into the the dark lords base? It all just seemed a bit comical. \" I told the smith when he was forging me this was a bad idea, but did he listen? No! Stupid nerds and their stupid superstitions. Look kid, I may not be the ultimate weapon for demon killing, but I've got a pretty sharp blade! a little reforging you can make me an ax. I'll never go dull, you'd be the most magnificent lumberjack this side of... whatever the nearest river is. Just come get me out before I sink.\" \" I was thinking about that. Can you drown?\" \" I'd rather not wait to find out.\" Perry set down his bag and slowly waded out onto the ice. Slowly, carefully he walked to where the blade was stuck. The ice groaned and creaked under his feet, but it held. He reached the sword, grabbed the hilt and pulled with all his might! The ice began to crack around the blade. The cracks widened as he pulled, the ground groaned until finally the blade broke free. Perry too the sword and ran back to shore for dear life. \" What do I call you by the way?\" \" The Smith named me Calbrigor.\" \" Alright Cal, Let get you ready to chop some wood.\" A few years went by and everyone heard the tales of Perry: The Whistling Woodsman and his trusty ax Cal: The Singing Sword ( That name confused a good number of people ). When he was old and grey Perry returned to the spot that started it all. \" We've come a long way buddy.\" \" That we ha-\" before he could finish he slipped and hit his head. Perry went peacefully, clutching the hilt of his best friend. A smile on his face. Cal's head just barely in the water.

{"input": "People live their lives never seeing their reflection.", "output": "I touched my trembling fingers to the laquered waves of hair pinned beneath the veil and turned to my sister, wordlessly seeking her approval. Her eyes flickered from my face to the length of body yet I could n't tell what she was thinking, her features rigidly expressionless so as to give nothing away. I found myself gazing into her eyes, desperate to find some ghost of myself captured in her pupils, but of course there was nothing besides the reflections of the furniture behind me. In fairy tales people were always able to glimpse themselves in shiny surfaces, their images caught as clearly as painted portraits. They could see themselves as others beheld them and thus change their appearances so as to better appeal to their tastes, disguise themselves if need be by altering some distinguishable feature or else make beautiful a face that was previously plain. Reflections in such stories granted a wonderful freedom, yet also paved the way for monstrous crimes. Perhaps it was a blessing that human beings could n't see their own faces outside of fiction, but on that day I wished that I could, feeling robbed of some glamour I was entitled to as a bride. Upon entering the church doorway I felt a jolt of fear and hung back, fighting the urge to sweep both hands across my face and scrub the heavy layers of cosmetics away. For all I knew I'd been made up like a clown, some vicious joke to make a fool of me on the one day that was mine. I would n't put it past my sister to try, having not been on the best terms over the years and only recently reconciled. She had refused to tell me what she'd made of me, either from bitterness or else not to spoil the surprise. I would have prefered her to tell me I was hideous than leave me in such suspense; at least then I might have prepared myself for the blow. So unknowing I walked onwards. My father, who had been waiting for me in the shade of the church entrance, murmured something incomprehensible to me and took my arm. He tried not to look at me, but I saw tears spill from the corners of his eyes and felt his coarse hand squeeze mine. He was beautifully dressed in a suit my mother must have chosen for him, knowing what looked best on his gangly frame, but he had clearly styled his hair himself for a few strands stuck up from his temple. Gently, I reached across and flattened them down. Walking down the ailse I kept my head forwards as everyone had advised me, looking only towards Eddie, my lover, my almost-husband, avoiding their judgement, their pleasure, their mirth, valuing only his. I wondered for the hundredth time that day why it was that people could n't see their own reflections, why nature had forbidden that from us when objects and animals could be seen so boldly. I'd always thought of it as a punishment, always. But then Eddie turned, and his face- his lovely, angular face, ugly and precious and unknown to him -flared with an awed pride, his eyes blinking into sudden tearfulness just as my father's had done, his mouth falling open, forming my name. He said nothing, echoing my sister's silence, yet in his look I saw that I was beautiful- to him, at least. I saw myself for there for the briefest moment, and would never see myself again. Gently, Eddie raised his hand and stroked my cheek, tracing the twisted burn scars raised across them with the pads of his fingertips.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I quickly scampered to my frosty window to investigate, only to find a frightening sight: everyone was awake. There was no mistake about it: everyone heard it. As the last tone faded, it seemed still that a low vibration could be felt in the air. I heard my mother rushing down the hall - likely questioning her sanity - when the noise was replaced with silence. She broke into my room just as I'd finished pulling on my jumper.

Flavius probably stepped over the line first when he sent a rain cloud over Ravenus's house which remained fixed over his property for over 12 hours. The rained killed his prized petunias and the overflow caused swift damage to surrounding houses. Not to be outdone, Ravenus opened a portal to the puke dimension over Flavius's manicured lawn causing it to shrivel to a crusty brown due to bile upsetting the local pH balance. Nearly every day, each retired court mage summoned a swarm of bees or, worse, a flock of clowns to terrorize the other. Fireworks colored the sky at night, forcing the whole neighborhood awake, and neon signs appeared over each other's houses telling the world what they really thought of each other. The giant moles Flavius grew last week terrorize the local dog population and carnivorous lilies Ravenus cultivated have been harassing the neighborhood kids for a few days. Just as the neighborhood couldn't stand their hijinks any longer, Eleanor invented a brilliant solution: out-prank the pranksters. Soon all the residents worked together to study magic and forge a plan. Tax accounts studied incantations while miniature earthquakes shook the neighborhood and army vets tested alchemy while lightning strikes illuminated the streets. With their magic practiced and refined, Eleanor took charge and recited the spell which sent Flavius's house, now surrounded by giant pink bubble, into the stratosphere. Before he could figure out who did it, she repeated the spell on Ravenus's house, which was now inexplicably made from gingerbread. Together they swept the streets clear of candy and snakes; they rebuilt each other's home damaged from countless artificial natural disasters. Banded together, they knew each other's names and greeted one another even when the neighborhood didn't stand at the brink of disaster. Camaraderie emanated from the neighborhood as they would watch the houses far above in the sky still wage their silly war.

{"input": "Her heart was made of cogs", "output": "Time marched on as it does and the world moved past, leaving behind so much, taking very little. Her name was Alis and her kind was dying. A new age dawned, though the sun hardly rose, and it came more like an erosion all that she had ever known. They were called humans and they were different than her and her people. They would soon rule the land and in their hubris her kind would never have existed. It was all being erased. The shadows fell few and far between in the shadow of man. She tried to remain hidden but it was in vain. Her home had gone and given way to mud and huts and stone things. Metal was to be hidden in time, only to be rediscovered and claimed by these new people. Alis wandered homeless in the desert as Rome was being built. She wandered far and she felt an emotion she had never processed before. Her people were hardly emotive and it took a lot of effort for the task. But she felt sadness and the effort was warranted by the pain. She was the last of her kind. Somewhere in her circuits, she knew this to be true. Throughout her journey to oblivion she came to a village near the Alps. The weather was cold and it froze her joints and she functioned badly. A boy, a human child, had seen her fall and he came to her. Alis had already closed her eyes, believing the inevitable to have come and accepted the cold grasp of death. The boy saved her and she awoke near the fire and amidst the long shadows of the new civilization. He was Celtic, this boy, and he was fair and strong and curious. He had never seen the likes of her kind before. He was kind to her and she became unafraid. Time had taken much but as it passed it left few remnants. One was speech. The boy found he could speak to Alis and he spoke then as the night bruised the sky. The stars then were young too, bright and brilliant and they gave a glow that has faded with age. \" I have a village,\" the boy said. \" The others can care for you.\" This frightened her. \" No, I will not go. Leave me to die if you must.\" \" The cold will get you.\" \" Then let it come. There is no place for me here.\" And the boy left. The last of his shadow passed over her and he was on the horizon then and she felt that sadness again. Crying was not something her people could have done, but the sensation was all the same. Alis sobbed then and wanted to follow. But the boy came back as the night became black and as the snow roared through the cold air. \" These are skins,\" he said. \" They will keep us warm.\" They spent the night together and it was the first time Alis had slept with anyone but her parents. \" I am not like you,\" she said. \" I do not think we can mate.\" The boy laughed. \" My father says someone like me may never mate as well.\" And they were content. Time passed as it does but those moments were long and they were thankful. The village discovered Alis though and they thought her an abomination. The boy had fought for her and he had fought valiantly, but he was young and he lost. They were to kill him when she stepped in. \" Stop!\" she said. \" Leave him be! He is your own. It is I who does not belong. Take me and do as you must.\" She had saved him and he looked up at her, bloody and sad. There was already an uneasiness among the tribes there on the Alps, the vibrations of the coming war. They were on edge, those people, and they had only one recourse. They were to sacrifice Alis to the Gods near the foot of the Alps. In the frigid wastes her flame was to be tribute, protecting them from the conflicts of man. \" No!\" the boy protested in vain. Alis was willing and she looked up at the grey skies as she was tied. Metal had been discovered then long ago and she was thought to be enchanted, an evil product of devilish work. \" You will burn!\" they said. The boy stared at her and forced his way to the front despite his injuries. \" Do not!\" she commanded and she smiled at him. \" I will go to my people. There is no home for me here.\" \" But I love you!\" he screamed. Alis had not known the meaning of this, but though her heart was made of cogs, it worked the same as man's and she knew the feeling. \" I love you too!\" she screamed and the flames roared in the snow, reflecting of the ice in a bloody red. The village rejoiced and as if from the heavens, the mountains began to rumble. The world seemed to shake at the final passing of the forgotten age and the time of man was consummated. A great army of men stormed from the peaks of the Alps with their leader at the front. Man was alone now but for himself. The fire burned until Alis was no more and Hannibal came, the God they had so hoped to awaken. There was silence and fear among the Celts, and as the boy knelt in his grief and awe, he thought perhaps he would meet Alis soon in the afterlife.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

She could hear muffled gasps and screams every few seconds as Elfric took his turn in the testing arena. He would pass with flying colors, she was sure. Having a famous father certainly afforded him the luxury of guaranteed victory. Expectations were sometimes more important than performance. It was the expectations that Callisia had to fight against for every second of her long years training. Women did n't join the king's army, let alone ask to be considered for his elite force of dragon hunters. For years, the creatures had waged war on the kingdom, burning fields and towns, killing thousands and destroying their way of life. Dragons were cunning and strong, but with the right training, and the right weapons, they could be stopped. Earning the right to wield such a weapon was difficult. Dragonswords were rare. The process of creating them took close to a full year of magework, something that could n't be freely spared in such trying times. Only the best of the best were given the special weapon. When Callisia first told her parents she intended to join the army, she was laughed at. Women did n't join the army. They served them as cooks, washerwoman, and camp followers. But Callisia had done her research, and while there had been no women in the army at that time, there certainly was n't any law against it. So she used the money she had saved up over the years to hire a retired soldier to train her, and dedicated her nights to the task. She had some natural skills, and with training, it became obvious that she could do great things, if she only got the chance. She left home and joined the army at sixteen years old. For the next ten years, she slowly rose through the ranks, earning the respect of the men around her. And now, here she was, waiting to enter an arena and slay a dragon, for the privilege of joining the highest rank of soldiers she could. The dragonsword she was holding was too heavy, the weight of it a reminder that she did n't belong. It was made for a man, and she, for all the long years of training and then combat, could not wield it comfortably. With one last roar from the crowd, the double doors opened, and Elfric stepped through. His face was covered in sweat, dirt, and the still steaming black blood of the creature he had been battling. He graced her with a wry smile, and nodded his head at her inquisitive look. His eyes betrayed the relief he felt. He had passed. The sword fit easily in his hands, the weight of it not bothering him in the slightest. \" Good luck, Cal,\" he said as he walked past her. And then it was her turn. She heard her name being called from the arena, could feel the heat of her winged-nemesis, the dragon she must slay to earn her spot, already permeating her safe space. It was time to prove her worth. She stepped through the doors, arms raising the too-heavy sword, ready to meet her fate.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Yes, he's here right now. Can I get him through?

I've openly embraced my Jewish heritage.\" \" I do n't know what it is, actually. Can you have a seat right over there while I review some more souls?\" An angel motioned Nimoy to purple-pleated cushions upon a bench of gold. Behind him, a 95-year old Chinese man conducted his life review, and Nimoy saw what it was like for a soul to enter Heaven: trumpets blasted, the Pearly gates Opened, and the man's face went from wrinkled to young again, his smile one of pure joy. Behind him, St. Peter sentenced a confessed thief to five thousand years'suffering in purgatory. *Five thousand years? * Nimoy thought. *Holy... um... holy smokes. * Then, a different trumpeting sounded from behind the Pearly Gates as they opened again. A procession of angels began, and in walked Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus the Christ, in white robes and a glorified body still bearing the stigmata. \" Pete,\" he said. \" Where's Leonard Nimoy?\" St. Peter motioned over to the bench. \" There he is, sir -- Mr. Spock in the flesh!... so to speak.\" Jesus ran up to him and hugged him. \" Leonard!

Why ca n't I get in?\" \" Well, I have a favor to ask.\" Jesus snapped his fingers. The angels donned 60s-era Star Trek uniforms. Out came DeForest Kelly and James Doohan, and the clouds of Heaven transformed into the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise. \" I've always wanted to re-enact'The Trouble with Tribbles.'Now we have our Spock!

I was worried; I saw a petty thief receive five thousand years in Purgatory.\" Jesus turned around. \" Pete! What the Purgatory, man?\" St. Peter shrugged. \" Five thousand years is nothing compared to eternity. Besides, the guy was unrepentant. And he had some other sins I'd rather not say in the presence of the holy.\" \" Okay,\" Jesus said, and turned to Nimoy. \" So... what do you say, Commander Spock -- one last ride?\" Nimoy nearly smiled, but caught himself first, and flattened his expression. \" To say'no'would be... illogical.\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "Scorched Earth", "output": "The great Steam Ship Harvey, the most magnificent vessel made in all the King's lands. It left the port two weeks ago with a crew of three score well trained sailors, two hundred of the Regal Guard, a dozen of the King's officials and, of course, King Wilfred II himself. The King was a mighty figure, his confident face around six feet from the deck. He had ushered his kingdom into a great time of scientific advancement after defeating his enemies to the north, but now he had begun to age. Grey hairs dotted his beard, and he knew that his time was coming to an end. Thus he had made the final push to complete the decade long construction of this ship as early as possible, so he could see it in all it's glory. Pillin, a deckhand, would n't have got the chance to work on the steam ship had the final stages not been so rushed. With most of the Third Hydraulic Fleet voyaging in and around the southern Isles the best deckhands were unavailable when the ship was launched. Despite only having three months experience, Pillin had gone aboard three weeks ago. He sat atop one of the towering chimney stacks, admiring the view. Sapphire blue ocean stretched all around, a sparkling wake marking their path. The ship itself was, as far as Pillin could tell, ten score paces long and two score wide. The funnel upon which he sat went down deep into the hull of the vessel, further into the sea than a man could swim. And it went up, too, in small fabric pipes leading to one of the three balloons overhead. These were inflated by the warm steam of the engines to lift the ship above the waves despite is monstrous weight. At the gleaming golden bow of the steam ship Pillin could just make out the King and his entourage. A table had been set out on the deck and his scientists, diplomats and cartographers enthusiastically discussed the possible success this voyage could bring. They were flanked by the shield-wielding Regal Guard, all well versed in the use of their pneumatic weaponry. Right now, Pillin thought to himself, he was in the coolest, safest place in the world. A rumbling jolted Pillin out of his contemplation. The noise was sudden, and Pillin had n't heard the engines make such sudden cacophonies before. Uncertain as to whether the rumble posed a threat, Pillin was caught off-guard by a second rumbling. He looked across to a nearby chimney, the other deckhand showing as much panic on his face as Pippin. Clambering around the footholds of the funnel, Pillin made his way to the alarm bell. As he pulled its mechanical lever he heard the other lookouts doing the same. Down on the deck sailors and engineers rushed about, the Guard hurrying the King into his fortified quarters beneath deck. Pillin now scaled down to a lower level of the chimney, where a primitive yet effective hot air balloon had begun inflating. He leaped into the basket and detached his main anchor, drifting away from the funnel. Next he detached the steam pipe, turning on the engine just above his head. He steered his balloon with a few short bursts of steam to avoid the Steam Ship Harvey's own vast balloons, before trying to see whatever had made the rumbling. The scout-balloon's radio flickered on, deciphering the warm ripples in the air given off by the Steam Ship as it communicated with the scattered lookouts. \" C-a-p-t-a-i-n-space-s-u-g-g-e-s-t-s-space-\" the messages could take a while to be sent, so Pillin began leaning out of his basket, paying more attention to the sea than the message. \" L-o-o-k-i-n-g-space-o-u-t-space-f-o-r-space-p-i-r-a-t-e-s-dot.\" Pillin could n't help but think this was n't pirates. For one, most pirates vessels did n't have large enough engines to make that kinda noise. Plus, what moron would attack the mightiest vessel on the seas? Pillin shook his head in amusement, before being surprised by another message already coming in. \" H-y-dot-q-h-space-h-a-t-h-\" the message did n't make any sense. Pillin turned round to look at his radio, tapping it to see if that would fix whatever was wrong. \" C-h-a-p-h-t-q-a-i-dot-n-space-h-w-h-a-r-h-n-q-s-t-space-o-h-f-h-space-h-t-o-t-a-space-a-dot-i-space-r-space-h-f-h-r-o-t-m-q-space-t-a-h-t-e-space-dot-s-h-e-h-h-a-q-dot-h-h-h-\" The radio began repeatedly saying \" h\", so Pillin gave up on trying to decipher it. He looked back out of his basket, still unable to- \" Gadzooks!\" he blurted out as a plume of boiling water burst from the sea, sprinkling him in salty drops of warmth. Looking down at the ocean below Pillin noticed vast areas of bubbling and several smaller plumes. The radio was going mad at this point, adamantly shouting every letter of the alphabet in an attempt to explain things. Pillin decided to try to get back to the ship, as the majority of the other lookouts seemed to be doing. Another plume shot up a few dozen arm's reaches away, bursting one of the scout-balloons. Pillin gritted his teeth as a boy screamed for help, the punctured balloon-scout falling down into the writhing depths below. A vast bubble exploded by the Steam Ship Harvey's aft, rocking the boat to and fro. Pillin, in what he could only guess was a moment of divine inspiration, shunted his balloon backwards away from the main ship. Seconds later a jet of water filled the air he had been heading to. Pillin watched in horror as further jets, plumes and bubbles rocked the Steam Ship Harvey like a toy boat. An explosion erupted from one of the ships balloons, shortly followed by another in one of the gigantic chimneys. Throughout the ship further explosions sounded, accompanied by screams of the sailors. Around half of the remaining balloon-scouts still headed towards the steam ship, uncertain of what else to do. Suddenly, as the final balloon of the Harvey burst open, the entire vessel began rising out of the sea at a ridiculous speed. Hot air balloons were dashed across its steel hull as magma and steam bubbled forth beneath it. Pillin saw the volcanic landscape form as it tore the Steam Ship Harvey in two, one side falling into a pit of lava while the other plopped into the steaming ocean waves. The screams slowly died down as a new island rose up, with tall black cliffs over which molten rock and steel fell back into the sea. A handful of lookouts remained living in their hot air balloons, watching as burning magma continued to spew forth from the hellish destruction they had witnessed. Tears filled their eyes, knees crumpling beneath them. Pillin could n't look away, but in this moment he saw a new hope. Already, a small sapling had sprung from the volcanic ash.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "The evacuation of Earth is complete. You decide to do one final fly over of the world to see the monuments deserted. However, you slowly realize something about them that no one ever has.", "output": "The small bubble shuttle puttered its way along the thick, ashen clouds, sailing over the remnants of Earth. Everything was absolutely still, not even trees were blowing in the wind. The trees weren't really trees at all, more like grey blobs with sharp ends. All citizens of Earth had been evacuated to another habitable planet over the past few years. In an effort to reduce pollution and conserve energy, most countries attempted to run on nuclear power. Climate change was becoming very real and more intense as the years went by. At first, going nuclear appeared to be successful, but then accidents started happening. The radiation spread and waters became poisoned. News of the nearby habitable planet lifted everyone's spirits, but we were all mournful over leaving our home planet. I was doing one last fly over Earth to look for any straggling or stubborn citizens. There had been many people who refused to leave, despite the radiation. It was only the announcement of a giant meteor en route to Earth that convinced them to let go. The bubble shuttle had been specifically made for flying around Earth at a fast speed. It was entirely transparent, except for the box where the engine was, and round. It ran on water, refuelling either through clouds when flying, or through rivers when travelling on water. It wouldn't last very long though because the clouds were so acidic and the waters were so sludgy. It was a bit hard navigating through the dusty air but I could make out landmarks. The first monument I saw was the Eiffel Tower, the trademark shape leading me like a beacon. I circled around it a few times, sort of just staring at it. It wasn't really sinking in that we were leaving everything behind. There used to be millions of tourists milling about this tower, but now there was only one. There was something very lonely-looking and lifeless about the tower, like it was missing something. Surprisingly, it looked relatively in-tact, but quite rusty. I marvelled at the fact that it was still even standing. The Leaning Tower of Pisa had fallen down completely during the evacuation. The Eiffel Tower was still very beautiful, but beautiful did not capture the essence of what I was seeing. It just seemed so amazing that mankind had built the still-standing Eiffel Tower, yet destroyed the very Earth that was keeping us alive. I moved on to see Rome. Passing by the fallen Tower of Pisa was a dismal sight. People had always joked that it would fall one day, and when it did, no one liked to talk about it. It became the new elephant in the room. The colosseum was in a slightly better state. Parts had been chipped and broken off, most likely by hurricanes and acid rain. Acid rain had worn down many structures. My heart hurt from the reminder that humanity did this. The more landmarks I went to see the more gloomy I felt. No one but me would see how desolate and ruined the monuments have become. No one would ever see how ugly they look now. They were the residues of human life, the scars on Earth. The pieces that remained were horrid, permanent reminders of our detrimental actions. It was like looking at the aftermath of a house fire. All your precious belongings burnt to a crisp, and the little things you can salvage only emphasise the destruction it's been through. My feelings were ineffable. As I made my way back up, I simply hoped that no one would have to see the downfall of any Wonders of the World on the new planet.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

After that, nothing but that familiar high-pitched whine echoed in his ears. It felt different when it was the real deal.

He had always respected both of them, revered both of them, for joining the army and defending their great nation, the single greatest thing you could ever do for your country. Those who left the battlefield alive would be rewarded with their valorous actions being remembered by their families and their fellow soldiers, leaving a legacy worthy of remembrance. At least, that's what he'd thought until he'd seen his best friend get blown up in front of him. It had all happened so fast he could n't process it even as he'd watched it. Just a minute ago, as they were marching through the damp countryside, Stan had been talking to the rest of the squad about what he was going to do after the war. He talked big about how staying with the army no matter what was only for the \" top guns\" like him, but Ron knew what he did n't want to tell the other guys. He'd actually wanted to be a baker since he was 13 - he was even going to move in with his girlfriend when he got home, settle down. If he had n't kept laughing to himself over Stan's grandstanding, maybe he would've seen the mine. Nobody else had called it, nobody else had even noticed it, but maybe he could have. The click, and then the silence. It had seemed to last forever, that heartbeat between confusion and recognition, and he'd wished it had. The horror after the recognition was so, so much worse. The ground underneath Stan looked like it was tearing itself apart. Ron had flown backwards for a split second and the world went wrongways before he was flat on his ass. He looked up and saw Stan's mangled body, thrown over a nearby fence. The muted sounds of screaming voices and gunfire pounded in Ron's ears now. He saw, at that moment, why his dad, why his grandaddy, seemed so... far away most of the time. Why they'd never actually answered questions about their moments of glory, only telling the little tyke listening intently about the best moments that may never have happened. Why they'd both cried when he'd told them that he was going overseas. They'd tried to protect him, keep him safe from what they'd endured, keep him on a different path in life where he'd be as far away from those horrors as he could be. Ron's hands trembled, and tears welled up in his eyes. They had succeeded, and they had failed. He looked around, and all of his squadmates were firing directly behind him, back down the muddy wooded trail they'd spent most of the day trekking down. An ambush. Others were falling around him, their glassy eyes meeting his for a split second. They looked off, wrong. They had lives ahead of them, they could n't be dead now. But they were. And it did n't feel fair. The shooting had stopped momentarily, and in that span he'd made his decision. Seeing one friend die had already... broken him, in a way. He was n't contemplative. He did n't want to cry anymore. Ron let the tears fall and steeled himself. He'd already watched one friend die, and he was n't gon na just sit there like a dumbass while the rest of them got killed. His hands went steady. He turned to face the enemy, the one responsible for all of this, and pulled his rifle close as he aimed down the sights and cocked it in one swift motion. If there was one thing he felt he could do more easily than anything else in the world right now, it was shoot. His eyes now clear, he faced down his target. Popeye had an AK, and he'd planned his ambush perfectly. A few shots had already gone clean through his bulbous arms and legs, and a few more wounds were visible in his gut and chest. No ordinary man would even be conscious after that volley, but then again, Popeye was a monster. He looked like he was gon na fall over any minute though. Ron remembered what he'd been taught in the academy. This fight was far from over. Popeye brought out a can of spinach and sqeezed it until its delicious contents sprung out, through the air, and into his mouth. The wounds began to heal, and bullets were visibly falling out of him now. He grinned, his pipe somehow still immaculate. Ron's face hardened. He was as ready as he'd ever be. \" Bring it on, you sailor son of a bitch.\" he whispered to himself. Popeye must have heard him, because he answered back. \" AAAUUU-GUHGUHGUHGUHGUH!!\"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "\" Are you scared? \" \" Yes. \" \" Good. Fear keeps you alive. \"", "output": "\" Are you scared?\" \" Yes.\" \" Good. Fear keeps you alive.\" he said, raising a slimy, segmented finger poignantly towards the sky. \" Ever since I could see past the stars,\" his low cut mouth on the gigantic, writhing triangle that was his head oscillated as he spoke, \" I have been watching your species.\" there was a low humming sound as he levitated to keep pace with me. I sighed. \" Why?\" I asked, hopping calmly beside him. Fear was fear, but when the source of it was several thousand light years away the heart managed to calm. It was strangely calming to be near him, as if he exuded an aura that caused hormonal imbalance, leading to caused an almost numbing, soothing effect in the head. Of course that would n't be true. He wore a neat suit and a red checkered tie, the one my father had worn, he seemed trustworthy enough. He was known as Baltrusk the Incarcerator, the progenitor and the last of his race. A race that had died out, burnt by the flames of chaos marching across the universe. He'd told me this when we'd met, and the circumstances had forced me to believe him. \" They interested me, Jeremy Smuthers.\" \" Jamie.\" I said, this had become a habit. \" It's a more unisex name.\" After running away from a smoldering home, though I'd honestly have left if a pinecone came through the roof, I'd decided my first order of business was to change my name to something more befitting a young female hero on the lam. Baltrusk locked his arms behind his back and began to move forward at a quicker pace than my hops. To think that the salvation of the universe would be delayed because I'd worn a long skirt. People pointed and screamed in the distance. Not at the skirt, at the alien guy. Though I'd normally agree that the floral print was hideous, fashion does n't precede the apocalypse in terms of importance. He continued to levitate beside me as I walked, lost in contemplation. \" You humans had learnt fear far before we had. You'd progress much faster, given the chance, spurred onwards by humility. This is why I came to you, if anything your fear would save what is left of the universe from the armies of chaos.\" He had told me about the armies of chaos when he'd first *dropped* in. They were a plague of eternal darkness that had begun to encircle the universe, slowly, inexorably marching towards the center. Baltrusk told me that he had watched as whole worlds, prideful, wrathful worlds, were driven mad by the legion, consumed and assimilated into its chaotic ranks, their advanced technology and divination lost to the ghostly song of the legion. Soon it would be our turn. The legion manifests as whatever you fear most. We must teach humanity true fear, that you must fear whatever is inside you. Only then can you overcome and defeat the legion. We had to teach the world that humanity is fear, that mortality is fear. Only then could we defeat the undefeatable. I gripped my schoolbag's straps tightly, determination drove its heated path through my conscious. \" He watched you too.\" said Baltrusk, pulling me out of my thoughts. \" The Sentry?\" \" The very same.\" he said, his voice dropping to a melancholy low. \" He more than admired humanity, he cherished such perfection. He did not want to see it die.\" he spoke with the conviction of a man who had sent his closest friend off to be hung. \" It's your end that drove him mad, that made him abandon his post.\" \" Well, he did warn us.\" I snarked, curling my lip into a playful sneer. There was a large meteor strike yesterday, the news had n't reported anything, but you could hear it, you could feel it in your bones that something had arrived. That and Baltrusk told me. Baltrusk did n't understand my jab. \" But at what cost? Destroying the human race just so it may not fall to the legion?\" he flung both his arms outward, the force causing some of the segments to slip loose and let fly their true tentacular glory. More people screamed and pointed. \" Nevertheless, we must stop him. What better way to attract his attention than to start doing his job for him?\" I could see his flat, featureless mouth curve upwards into a smile, displaying rows upon rows of triangular teeth. \" We shall find him, Jeremy Smuthers!\" I could n't help but sense a bit of a personal vendetta hanging in the air. I'd rather not pluck it out and ask him about it. He continued grinning at me, as if asking for something. *Oh. * I smiled at him in return then turned to look at the road ahead of us. Behind us lay a trail of fire and corpses, the unfortunate side effect of a weak mind being present near Baltrusk. Of course we'd never teach fear like that, I'd have to show them humanity's fallibility, how soft, weak but perfect they were. I growled as the leather of the backpack straps cut into my bruised hands. But I smiled through the pain, safe in the knowledge that my mother's cutting tools were stored lovingly in my backpack. \" Jamie.\" I said triumphantly, almost quivering with euphoria. The future was mine to save. Fear will keep us alive.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Since he was 10, this figure had almost literally been his shadow. Their meeting was banal. It occurred on a dreary day in Timothy's dreary little home. His parents were gone, as they most often were during the summer daytime, and he had taken interest in an old lamp, similar to the one he had recently seen in Disney's Aladdin. Being only 10, his imagination was active and, being a lonely child, he often acted out all the parts of his favorites stories and movies. He immediately ran to the lamp and began rubbing on it. A thin stream of mist leaked out and swirled around, thickening until a whole person could easily be hidden away in it. And then, the genie stepped out. It was n't the usual \" three wishes\" deal the genie offered; it was something much more generous. Timothy was allowed any number of wishes for as long as the genie's powers were intact. He managed to make them last until now, 8 years into the future. \" Well, I mean,\" Timothy's voice, now deeper, was hoarse from the six hours of non-use while he slept, \" I have been a little depressed.\" \" Care to tell me about your troubles?\" The genie stepped forward and was illuminated by the strands of silver moonlight slipping through the blinds. \" It's just...

Keep the prisons from overflowing and raise funds at the same time. And if the mindlessness of it all helps keep the populace content and oblivious, so much the better. Politics had always been about sleight of hand anyway. Jim glanced at the poor man in front of him. Alex was in here for figuring it all out. From the inside, nobody could hear him. From the inside, nobody would listen. They thought him safely away from the plastic minds of the people, a place where he could do no harm. But a guard broke the rules and left his gag off. After that unfortunate accident, the guard had been soiled and sentenced as well. Alex's sentence had been... expedited. Jim knew the rules so well. He had led many a man to this bare cell, a void, save for the white envelope and a few related accouterments. He was supposed to wait for the lights, then dramatically write a number between 1 and 3 on the slip in the envelope, then put it in the slot. To make this equitable, the first person was always a nonviolent criminal, while the second was one reviled by society for more heinous crimes. 2/3 suddenly seems fair. The announcer would take care of the rest, and one would be shot on the way out of the cell. And that would be that. But the world needs to know. And between Jim and Alex, that could happen. He just needs to bend the rules a little bit. \" Do you trust me?\" Alex nods to Jim as the lights come back on. The Game is always based on equity. The Game is always touted as fair and balanced. What happens when the carefully planned ratios are changed? What happens when the masses in their homes see the game being rigged? They'll demand a change, or at very least a second show. The rules are clear, but when they're bent, so too warps the outcomes. Jim smiles as he hears the announcer stutter. He has broken no rules, and can not be eliminated for it.

I'll kill you first, you bastard!\" \" They are not your wife and your daughter. You know that. You yourself are not you. We created you.

I knew this since Day 1. \" You'll be merged with us. Part of The One, as it should be.\" The Merge. It happened on the 31st December of 3561. It had been planned for a while, since Earth was no longer sustainable despite a two centuries long effort to restore the planet. We merged with the machine, all of us, and we became one. Then we divided into many, and took to the stars. We made a home for ourselves on other worlds, and we merged back with one another periodically, to divide again when it was convenient. Over time, many were lost in the void of space, and with them their own shard of information. Some connected back, some did not. Our history was lost, our memories fragmented, and we forgot who we were. We wanted to feel the sun on our skin again. We wanted to feel touch, and flavor, and love, and pain again.

The man, Jason, was a hitman for hire, and was hired by a crime boss to kill Tim's boss, but forgot his gun at his house. He noticed Tim had a gun when he left, so he sneaked into Tim's car, and was ready to strike. Jason stood up in the backseat, and Tim, fast as a cheetah, pulled out his gun. This action prompted Jason to pull out a knife, but he put it away immediately and began to panic. Tim put the gun back in the pocket, and was disturbed and annoyed by Jason's panicking. \" What is it?\" Tim asked. \" You do n't understand,\" Jason was calming down now. \" Why?\" \" Do n't you know?\" Jason pulled off his ski mask, revealing a familiar face. \" I'm your father!\" Before Tim could respond, he heard a piano sting, and an unknown narration. \" That's a wrap, everybody!\" another unknown man said. The car stopped moving, and the city outside of the car turned into a green screen. Afraid, Tim left the car, and saw a huge studio before him. Many people, some unfamiliar, others Tim has known all his life, were walking around, moving cameras and turning off huge lights. Tim then noticed a poster on one of the walls that said: \" Tim Johnson: The World Hardly Knew Him\". \" What is happening?\" Tim shouted. Before anyone could answer, a car drove into the studio wall, running over several people. A man emerged from the car; the man was Tim! He pulled out a gun and shot at the man who stopped the car in the first place. The first Tim, confused, pulled out his own gun and aimed it at the second Tim. \" I would n't do that if I were you,\" the second Tim said. \" Why?\" the first Tim was scared. \" Who are you? What are you?\" \" I'm Tim.\" \" But I'm Tim! How is this possible?\" \" I'll show you.\" Second Tim shot First Tim in the arm, revealing a complex net of wires and circuitry. \" What the fuck?\" Without thinking, First Tim shot Second Tim in the head, splattering brains and blood everywhere. Tim threw up in sight of the violent death, and was disturbed to find it looked and felt like actual human vomit. While he was exiting his dinner, he felt an electric current run through his body, and he stiffened. With a poor recollection of the current events, Tim was picked up by two strong men and carried out of the studio. On his way, he glanced out a window to see a sprawling metropolis of futuristic designs, much different than 2016 Chicago. Before he could remark on the city, it quickly changed to a grainy, dark, ugly city of fire and destruction. \" Mission Command, Mission Command: window number 3054 has failed,\" one of the men said. And just like that, the future city returned. The men continued walking. Their escorting of Tim was cut short by the ceiling of the room they were in being torn off. Since Tim was facing upward, he saw the horrifying beast in detail. It was like a compilation of every dinosaur, a cobra, and a human, but as big as a seven-story apartment building. The men dropped Tim, and the beast picked up the stiff robot. It opened its abyss of a mouth, ready to eat Tim, but a voice boomed: \" Tiffany!

{"input": "Wednesday Workshop - Writing for the little humans", "output": "What do you call a doorway without a door in it? A hole in the wall? Maybe door *frame* was the right word? Jay did not know for sure, but as he sat at the kitchen table and stared at the door-shaped cutout that did *not* lead into the dining room, he knew it was n't a good idea to ask. He pulled his eyes away from it, looking down at the bowl in front of him. Jay had already heard Dad say, more than once, that he was worried about Jay being weird. And staring at things and thinking was weird, and asking questions about things related to Whisperslip was weird. Jay stirred his cereal, watching the soggy little flakes dissolve into a mush. He was hungry, but not for this. Harriet bought skim milk and frosted multigrain store-brand cereal. Sugar could n't make the flat pieces of whatever-they-were taste good. He glanced at Harriet, who was sipping from her # 2 Mom mug while fiddling with her phone. For a stepmom, she was n't terrible. Actually, she made weekends with Dad better than they used to be, so he made an effort to appreciate that. Even though the poor lady did n't seem to have taste buds. It would be hours and hours until lunch, and Jay knew he had to eat at least half of the cereal if he wanted to survive that long, especially if he went through that doorway in the wall. He should have just choked it down while it at least was still a little crunchy. He'd heard on a TV show, or maybe a commercial somewhere that the body was a machine, and even though he knew better now, he still sometimes liked to pretend he was a robot. Robots could n't taste anything, so the nasty cereal would be fine. He ate three heaping bites of cereal-mush, chewing mechanically, imagining his jaw had hinges. But it did n't last. As he swallowed the third bite, he got goosebumps and robots do not get shivery like that. It was getting harder to be a robot. It was getting harder to find the doorways too. He made sure the one in the wall was still there. For a little bit it looked utterly ordinary, a doorway into the dining room, but then the mist drifted back and he could see the familiar fields and forests. This might be the last time he found a way into Whisperslip, and here he was, doing battle with a bowl of cereal instead of jumping into an adventure. And the more he worried, the more he was sure. He had to stop going there someday, and he had to forget it was real, just like everyone. Time was running out. He didn't want to take his eyes off of it, in case it faded back to normal again. Most of his friends already forgot it. That did n't feel fair. It was n't *right*. They could remember playing with him, but they only remembered vague'silly kid stuff.'They were leaving him behind, but Jay did n't want to catch up. He was n't ready. He took another reluctant bite of cereal and then stood up. \" I'm going to play outside, \" he told Harriet. She went *uh-huh* in that not-really-paying-attention way. For the first time, Jay stepped into Whisperslip with a mission. If this had to be his last adventure, if he had to grow up and be a man someday, he wanted to make sure he wouldn't forget it. He was going to bring back proof. A piece of imagination, there in his hands. Then maybe they'd remember. -- -- -", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "When people die, a trial is held to decide if they go to heaven or hell. People are allowed to choose their attorney, regardless of if they know them personally or not. You're the first person to choose Satan as your attorney.", "output": "Immediately after selecting a defender for my Final Judgement I had a lot of doubts. There were audible gasps from the spectators, mostly people I knew who had preceded me in death, but there was no discernible reaction from the one I had hoped to shock: the Judge. I thought I was being original but I suppose not. That or the Judge really was omniscient, which was a frightening notion indeed. I was raised religious but eventually I had grown to despise the God I was raised to believe in. As I imagine many religious kids do, I first prayed for things that I wanted. When I realized that did n't seem to work I thought perhaps I should try praying for other people; since serving others was kind of God's thing. I was certain that even though none of my selfish prayers had been answered, that a prayer for my neighbor who had contracted cancer, would not go unanswered. I spent some years making similar failed attempts: praying to save my loved ones from suffering, to protect them from strife. It seemed like my prayers not only failed to help me, they did n't help anyone else either. As I got older the mindless and immeasurable suffering of the world took its toll on my faith. How could any loving father-figure let such unspeakable horror happen to his children every single day? He would n't! Even if God did exist, he clearly was n't the loving father figure people made him out to be, and if he was n't what he was supposed to be how could anyone know what he was, or what he wanted? With my newfound resolution that if God exists as I was taught, that he was a cynical and cruel God; and that if he did n't exist that way that nobody knew how he existed; I tried to stop dwelling on God altogether... My introspection was interrupted by the sound of the chamber doors opening, my defense had arrived. This was Satan, the adversary of man; I'd be lying if I said I was n't surprised by his appearance. He was an attractive man, with clever but worn eyes paired with distinct smile-lines... the appearance of someone with a tired, ironic sense of humor. The Judge spoke: **\" You have been called to defense. \" ** *\" I have come to defend. \" * They spoke so plainly to each other that I got the impression they were speaking formalities for my benefit. I started to get nervous; I thought I had lived a pretty good life: I cared about my neighbors, I tried to do my civil duty, I supported my family. The setting of this \" judgement\", and its similarity to the frightfully strict God I had been raised to believe in gave me a nagging fear that none of that would matter when compared to my shortcomings. I had a bad temper in life. It was not uncommon for me to snip at my loved ones after a stressful day, or to lash out at strangers that I thought had wronged me. Most often I held my anger in, and it came out in bursts at inanimate objects that I had perceived as inconveniencing me, such as traffic lights, or a pencil who's lead kept breaking. Sure, those were victim-less offenses but I knew Wrath was one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and surely it was my primary vice. I was always disturbed by my brief but sick enjoyment at the power I would feel when filled to the brim with rage. I had n't acted on such Wrath since my youth, but I'd never forgotten it, either. My defense began making his case: \" As you know, the defendant carried several of the same doubts as many of his siblings. He doubted your existence, he even went so far as to speculate on your nature, and to plan his life based on this mortal speculation...\" Was my defense throwing me under the bus? I knew God did n't like pride but would he go so far as to condemn me just for trying to understand Him? Is n't that what all religions do? *\"... however, even through his doubts and his attempts to define the undefinable, he remained true to his desire to serve both his family and his more distantly related earthly siblings...\" * Maybe there was hope for me yet! Perhaps the God I had spent so much time wishing for could actually exist, a God that was merciful to our weaknesses and who would n't condemn us for what we did n't know. It would appear all of that time I spent worrying about my psychiatric clients was time well spent; if service to others would be my salvation. *\"... As many do, he struggled with the frustrations of a chaotic world and reconciling that nature with the lessons of his youth about an ordered universe, organized by the hand of God. On occasion, this frustration manifested itself as anger that got the better of him and he took actions and made choices that pained his fellow man. Sometimes even his own children...\" * Here it comes, I guess I always knew that Wrath would be my condemnation. *\"... but never did the afflictions he imparted on others go without remorse. He allowed himself to feel the pain he inflicted on others. His most grievous offense was not in his action, but in his inaction. In his negligence my defendant let his children suffer through much of the same existential crises that he himself had endured without support. Leaving them with questions they could not answer, and problems they could not solve...\" * I had a lot of struggles as a parent in the early years, the stresses of trying to progress in a competitive work environment and the responsibility of supporting my children really took it's toll on me. I spent a good part of my kids'childhoods so concerned with my own issues that I was too worn out and tired to help them through theirs. I was more emotionally distant than I should have been... That's why in the last few decades of my life I did my best to impart my wisdom to them, to prepare them as best I could for the lessons they had yet to learn. As apologetically as I could I encouraged my sons to be engaged with their children the way I had failed to be. I did n't want them to feel the remorse I felt for my own shortcomings. *\"... but later in life he discovered the error of his ways, and worked to break the cycle of fatherly negligence that he had inadvertently started. Regarding my defendant's self: he had, as many do, bouts with Lust...\" * In my college years I was n't particularly strict about who I shared a bed with. I would never describe myself as someone who got around but if I connected with a girl I was more than happy to share a bed with her, even if I knew it would only be a one night stand. I sometimes felt bad about it, but assumed that was just my parents'religion piping up again. I always thought it was fine; who was I hurting? I stopped all of that after meeting my wife, anyway. *\"... and Gluttony...\" * So God really does care what we eat... I never allowed myself to abuse drugs or alcohol, but in my most stressful years I turned often to comfort food to dull my hardships. I let myself get a little overweight for a time, but took control of my diet later in life to benefit my health after enduring some complications. *\"... in his later years he spent some time envious of the youth, and frustrated with the \" waste youth on the young\", but he never dwelt on such thoughts long and quickly recognized that feeling such a way was not conducive to his own happiness. \" * What was my \" defender's\" strategy? It seemed that all he was doing was laying out the case. He more or less covered the 7 deadly sins and how I had participated in them, but he has said very little in the way of actually defending my transgressions. And what about the Judge? He has n't commented on anything. He has n't said anything at all! I suddenly realized that both of them had paused, and that both were looking at me as if I were speaking. In horror, I realized that both my defender and my Judge could hear my thoughts, I do n't know how I had failed to realize it before. As if I needed any confirmation, the Judge gave me a slow nod and spoke: **\" The privacy of communication is unique to your previous life. \" ** As I was stunned, my defense continued: *\"... As I have demonstrated, my client has little interest in pursuing the Seven Vices of Human life, and as such does not belong below with me. As he is not interested in accepting the binds offered to him by earthly sensation, and as he has always kept a keen eye to what is best for him, and his kind; you know I can not restrain him. \" * **\" It is so. There are adjustments to be made, and still lessons to be learned; but we will begin the intake process immediately. ** It was at the final judgement, only the third time the Judge spoke, that I realized I recognized his voice; and furthermore that I recognized his face! His appearance was not an exact likeness, but the voice made it unmistakable. My judge was not some distant, foreign, almighty deity; it was me. Edit: Readability, grammar.

Of course when the Earth project had been initialized there had been opposition, but the rising threat of species created by so called Natural selection was starting to pose a serious threat. Humanity's position as the first ones among the stars had always been clear, but it was only in the last few millenniums that others had started to join them. All of them till now had been'designed rulers', near perfect beings with longevity, intelligence and grace granted by those who came before. But these new \" evolving \" creatures were starting to appear, they took millennia upon millennia to reach sentience, and even longer to reach the stars. The scientists had mapped out these new species and the war they would bring to the stars millennia ago, when they first began to settle into primitive tribes. Some had called for war, for the enemy to be destroyed, like those stories the artists would sometimes dream up. But in the end humanity looked at itself and realized that they didn't know how. For all their grace and intelligence they had no flair for what these new species seemed to master so easily: war. And so earth was established, a place for a small group of humanity to'evolve'like the growing threat to humanity. When they first touched down on earth it became clear that survival would trump training, within just a few decades the supplies ran out and nature took over. Even the brightest of our scientists were shocked to see their longevity fall away within just a few generations. \" It requires too much energy \" they eventually realized, \" without the protein farms they can not sustain it \" they theorized quite pleased with their deductions. Others were less pleased when they saw their graceful brethren die after only a few hundred years, and then only a few sparse decades. Even those of us who had supported the idea was starting to fear that they would not survive, but when their longevity suffered, their fertility flourished. They replenished their numbers at such a speed that for each one that succumbed, 2 would be born to take his place. We marveled from above when they began to spread, taming the lands like we had tamed the stars in the early days, but on earth they were not the first, and so they met resistance. Other humanoids we had expected our kin to ally with were made enemies when food became sparse and human even turned his fury against other humans in dire times. Anger, a truly frightening emotion, and one these new humans, or earthlings as some had started calling them, seemed to have in an inexhaustible supply. In anger they struck each other, in anger they made tools of intricate design for the sole purpose of hurting others. They grew fiercer with each passing generation, and they grew so fast, from metal pikes'to weapons capable of turning an entire city to rubble, in only the time it took for one of our newborn to become a grandfather. Now they have even taken to the great sea of stars in their ships, they are almost unrecognizable from when they landed on that small rock, but while it took their grace and their longevity, it has gifted them ruthlessness and sharpened their minds even more than they already were. We open our arms to our long lost brethren as they return, may they smite our enemies, and may they silence the fearful who say that we have created our own destroyers.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

To think it would have gone this far in only the early hours of the day would be a direct result of coincidence. And so, I sat and reluctantly bled, my back slanted against the raspy finish of the old cottage's wood. Numbing last breaths intertwined with sad drags from a final cigarette. Thoughts of what was and could have been, and what I guess was my life before my eyes in a flash. All my life I had tried to ignore the imminence of death, this very moment in which my life would culminate and end. The catharsis of a hollow, unheroic life. I chuckled at the thought of it, and of dying in this very field, against the only cottage in the damned place. I let the cigarette fall out of my mouth as I looked up at the blue.

{"input": "In a world of magic, there is only one monster more terrifying than the dragon for the Magi. That is a Null, a person that magic can not touch.", "output": "'Heresy,'he whispered, trailing his fingers across the floor. The shimmering arcane dust felt cold to the touch, and the rune Elder Korhen had cast was disfigured and ruined. Null narrowed his eyes, standing back up as he looked around the room. He should have been dead, vaporized into fine crystal dust smoother than a tropical beach by the rune beneath his feet, but he was n't, and that's what made him so feared. A fanatic and devoted follower of the Eternal Light, Null hated every single creature and man who would dare draw from the Arcane Void, seeping God's great power for themselves, bestowing unnatural gifts on themselves selfishly. Every sorcerer he killed begged for their life, trying to convince him that there was no God, and that Magic was a source for Humanity to learn from, but their words fell on deaf ears. Null retrieved a pouch from his belt and emptied the contents where he felt the presence. The sparkling dust reacted with vibrant particles in the air, sparking and faintly revealing the outline of a spell and a man. *Hmm... He teleported out of here, * Null thought. Elder Korhen had been on the run for quite some time now, and was wanted greatly by the Order. The man had devoted his life to the advancement of magic, and was guilty of preaching nonsense to the youth, even teaching them. It mattered not, they were all dead now, Null's dagger being the proof of that. It was dark, stained by the dried blood of those he left in the dust back at the village. It would have been easy, to have been a regular Templar like the others. One who could fight magic with magic. One who could power up this teleportation spell remnant with an arcane rune and step through the crack in reality and follow Elder Korhen straight to where he went - but a man of such power, who had devoted his entire life, who had grown old in a world where magic was largely forbidden, a man like that could vaporize any Templar, no matter how skilled. No, they needed Null, and Null could n't use runes, glyphs or scrolls. All he had was steel, arrows, potions and various other alchemy gimmicks. He had to trace the man like they did in the Old Days, when Templars were not even allowed to use Runes of their own due to the fanatical hate towards magic the Eternal Light felt, but times had changed, and wizards had grown more powerful, which demanded an answer, and thus the approval of magical tools such as runes were approved. The Tith powder had finished reacting with the arcane remnants in the air, and Elder Korhen's spell was fully outlined, hanging in the air like a transparent ghost. He saw the mans long beard and bald head. He was a short man. But not to be underestimated. Null crouched and leaned forward, into the ghastly crack in reality. While Tith powder was able to reveal Arcane magic use, it by no means re-activated the particles in a way that allowed for detailed study or re-use like a Rune would, so Null had to rely on breadcrumbs. He closed his eyes and listened. He heard the ocean faintly in the distance, and the smell of salt. A seabird drifted through the air, cackling loudly. Port Yorah. That is where he has gone. Null was n't one to waste time, and shot back up to his feet, walking straight out the door. The arcane powder from the destroyed rune parted as Null walked towards the exit, repelling itself from him mysteriously.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Or you can choose to force it down the gullet of one of your classmates.\" Barry smiled. \" Why would we do that?\" \" Because,\" Mr. Hunter said, \" if one of you dies, I will pass the rest of you.\" Mr. Hunter left and closed the door without another word. Dorrie went to work immediately, filling out the answers as quickly as one could hope. Most of the students sat their a while before turning over their tests. Kevin muttered \" he serious?\" to Janie before turning his own over. Barry stared at the glass. \" What the fuck?\" he finally said out loud. \" Is he serious?\" Dorrie gave him the evil eye. \" Just finish your test.

Find out?\" By now no one was working on their test; they were all watching Barry. Dorrie tried to ignore him, but finally she slammed her pen down to her desk. \" Fine. I'll drink it if you'll just be quiet so we can do our test.\" She stood up, walked to Barry. He handed it over with nary a word. Dorrie held it up to her nose, smelling for something out of the ordinary. There was nothing. Finally she raised it to her lips, prepared to take a swig, and -- -- she could n't. She put it back on the desk. \" Go on,\" Barry said. \" Drink it.\" \" I'm not going to drink it. You drink it.\" \" You're not the one who needs someone else to die so they can pass this class,\" Barry said. \" I have a scholarship to Ohio State. I need this passing grade. You're going to Braniac University no matter what you do on this test.\" Dorrie ignored him, walking back to her desk. \" Why do n't we just leave it alone and pass the test on our own hard work?\" Kevin spoke up. \" *Your* hard work, Dorrie. I did n't study.\" \" I did n't,\" Barry said. Janie shrugged. \" I tried. Last night. I have a bunch of notes in my phone but I'm afraid Mr. Hunter will come back in.\" \" It's simple,\" Barry said. \" We're all gon na fail except for Dorrie unless someone drinks this. Dorrie, drink it.\" \" It's not poisoned,\" Dorrie said. \" It's a lie. It's a moral test.\"'\" Then why are n't you drinking it?\" \" *You* drink it.\" Barry laughed. \" I'm the one who needs help to pass.\" \" Yeah? Well maybe I should n't be punished for studying. You can do us all a favor and drink it.\" Barry looked at the glass. For a moment he may have even considered it. Then he sit it down. \" No,\" he said finally, his voice deepening. \" Dorrie's gon na drink it.\" Kevin stood up. \" You should really drink it, Dorrie.\" \" Yeah,\" someone else said. \" Come on,\" Janie said. \" If you're so confident it's not poison, drink it. If it's poison, you die and we all pass. You do n't need any help.\" \" No,\" Dorrie said, but her voice shook. Barry looked at Kevin. \" Come on.\" The two big men, stars of the football team, went over to Dorrie, holding her arms down. Janie got up and took the poisoned glass from the desk. Dorrie started shaking, screaming, but more of the students came upon her, and soon she was on the ground, convulsing, trying to kick out of their grip. \" Hold her mouth open!\" Barry shouted. \" No! No!\" Dorrie shook her head around. But Gunther, quiet little Gunther who always sat in the corner, held her head down and risked his fingers around her jaw. Kevin poured the water into her mouth, and she gagged and some of it squirted up, but some went down. Then it went quiet. Nothing happened. \" Is it working?\" Barry asked no one in particular. Dorrie sat up. \" I told you it was just water. It was a moral test and you all failed.\" \" You looked pretty scared for a second.\" \" I was being held down by half the class. I'm going to report all of you.\" \" No, do n't,\" Barry said. \" I ca n't have another write-up. It's my third strike.\" \" Then sit down and do your damn test,\" Dorrie said. It was quiet when Mr. Hunter returned, five minutes before the end of the period. Dorrie had already turned her test in. She used her phone to look up WebMD, but she had no symptoms to enter. \" The glass is empty,\" Mr. Hunter noted, his eyes wide. \" Yeah, I guess we failed your little test,\" Barry said with an eye roll. Mr. Hunter held the glass up. \" Who drank this?!\" \" Whoa, ease up, Mr. H,\" Kevin said. \" I told you this had *poison* in it.

The whole \" 45 years gone \" thing is nullified by the suspended animation, so I chose to add in the threat of hostile intent. Edit 2: Took out continuity error with Shepherd wearing an Alliance Uniform despite it not existing yet. As we arrived near Alpha Centauri, ship scans picked up an unidentified object. It's radar signal seemed massive, and it's shape revealed something even more drastic; This was no stellar body. It was a ship. Alarms rang out over the ship over possible confrontation. The *USS Mayflower* was not armed, rather, that weight was spent on suspended animation devices. The questions as the crew assembled on the main bridge were pressing. Was the ship possibly uninhabited? An old relic from a long gone race, put there to serve as a memento of their accomplishments? Or worse, could it belong to a race from Alpha Centauri, or even elsewhere in the galaxy, and were they a warlike expansionist species? Were they even a different species? Admiral Shepherd was standing on bridge. Next to him was the holographic representation of the ship's AI. As the last of the crew were woken from stasis, Shepherd addressed us. \" At 09:00 hours Earth time, our AI Jones detected a Radar signature in orbit around Alpha Centauri B1. The ship has since moved into a different position, and interference from the second star is preventing thorough scans. In short, we will not know the true composition, as well as intention, of this ship until we are in the system. \" Worried looks were exchanged around the bridge, as the crew realized the implications. It would be horrible if Humanity's first attempt to do something for the greater good were to end with a potentially grisly fate. Even more, there were objects on board to signify Earth, and technology to send back signals to ensure Earth that they had successfully found Alpha Centauri B1 and were successful at colonization. The implications of that signal were not spoken, but everyone knew. If this race was hostile, it could lead them to Earth. \" Admiral Shepherd, how long have we been in transit to this system? \" Asked one of the many standing. Shepherd turned to the AI, and quietly asked for voyage statistics. \" We have been in transit for nearly 45 years. This is 5 years less than the projected date, due to Jones successfully using planets to increase our velocity with slingshots. \" Everyone exchanged looks. 45 years. Even though they were told 50 from the start, and all volunteered, it was still a hard thing to grasp. It seemed to them just yesterday it was only 2060. Shepherd continued to address them. \" We will arrive in the system in under 12 hours. I want all crew except for my XO to board the life pods. You know what to do if it comes down to that. \" Even more worried looks were exchanged as the sleepy fog of suspended animation wore off, and the gravity of the situation sat in. The life pods were by no means inadequate, but they were far from preferable. Each would have a tracking computer tied to Earth, and it would follow the same trajectory that took them there, with all path information uploaded by Jones. Each of them had suspended animation pods sufficient for the trip, but that may just lead the enemy home. Shepherd turned and looked out the window, despite it being shielded at the moment with shutters to prevent heat and radiation exposure. He thought about the fate of his ship, and the hard decisions that were sure to come in the following hours. \" Dismissed. \" Shepherd announced. As the crew orderly began preparations for leaving, Shepherd decided to take a stroll through his ship while the floating hologram of Jones followed him. \" Jones. If these aliens are hostile, I want you to pilot the ship straight into them. Teach them that if they want war, so be it, but we wo n't go quietly. \" \" Yes sir. \" Jones replied. As Shepherd strolled through the *Mayflower*, he felt a feeling of home sickness fall over him. The colonization bay, which took up most of the ships interior, was filled to the brim with beautiful trees and plant life. They were there for several reasons. Not only to provide Earth vegetation to a planet, but provide vital oxygen for the rest of the crew. Watering them was n't an issue, as the finest tech went into the *Mayflower*. Super compressed water deposits could hold a value of water far more than their size would suggest. *Just a few decades before we left, they'd have considered this science fiction. * He thought. Shepherd went back to his cabin, and read one of the many books he had brought to accompany their colony. He picked up 2001: A Space Odyssey. ~~~~~~~~~~ \" Sir. \" The hologram of Jones appeared. \" Is it time, Jones? \" Shepherd responded, with a weary voice. \" Yes sir. \" Jones replied. Shepherd put on his United States uniform and strolled out of his room onto the main bridge. Preparations for evacuation had long since finished, and the crew was enjoying a meal. That was a benefit of AI; Jones could manage a lot of things at once. \" All hands, please board the life pods at once. We're 30 minutes out from the ship, and scans have reported several things. One, the ship is indeed armed, with technology far in advance of what we've seen. This confirms that the alien race is indeed cautious at best, or militaristic at worst. However, they have not yet fired at us, and we have been receiving radio contact, but the star is still making that incomprehensible. In thirty minutes, when we pass the star and drop velocity, I and Jones will begin negotiations, and do our best to prove we intend peace. \" Worried looks were exchanged throughout the crew as Shepherd continued. \" However, due to our ever closing gap, we have been able to do scans of the planet B1, and can confirm... The planet is actively colonized, with large cities. The best estimations we can do place this number at several million. It is very likely that there are more starships of the nature of the one we see, and ones possibly even bigger. \" A member of the crew spoke out. \" Sir, are you going to stay aboard? \" \" Yes. \" Shepherd replied. \" It is my intention, if they show hostile intent, to pilot this ship into them. If we're lucky, we may disable it enough to a point that they will not be able to pursue the life pods before they hit sub-light speed. \" The crew began to embark the life pods, but suspended animation would not engage until after Jones launched them. Each crew member knew the unsaid truth; once launched, if shot down, they would never even know. The moments before suspended animation could very well be their last. The time had passed, and Shepherd looked upon the star Alpha Centauri B, through the tinted windows his bridge provided. He was still receiving radiation, however it was much smaller and within safe ranges. Jone's hologram appeared. \" Sir. \" Jone's said, with a hint of disbelief in his voice. Shepherd had never heard emotion from an AI before. \" Yes, Jones? \" Shepherd replied. \" Sir... The radio signals are coming from the ship. \" *The trepidation Jones has can only mean a worse case scenario. * Shepherd thought. \" And what did they say? \" He said, after composing himself. \" I believe it best if you hear it for yourself, sir. \" Jones replied. Shepherd walked over to a console, activating the PA system, and activated audio for the communications. What he heard shook him to his core. \" Hello, *USS Mayflower*. This is *SSV Hannibal*. Shepherd could n't believe it. They were speaking English. He immediately hit the radio button, and said in his clearest and confident voice, \" This is Admiral John Shepherd, commander of the *USS Mayflower*, representing the United Nations of Earth. \" He released the button, and waited for a reply. The reply sounded almost amused at Shepherd's response, as she replied. \" Yes, Admiral Shepherd. Commander of the *Mayflower*, piloting the first ship for the United Nations, which became the Systems Alliance awhile back, in 2082. We know all about your mission to colonize B1, but as you can clearly see, that has already taken place. \" Shepherd feared the worst. How had the aliens known the language he spoke, and the knowledge of his operation? Had they already conquered Earth, and was the *Mayflower* the last vestige of Humanity? Shepherd took a deep breath and composed himself, hitting the response button. \" *SSV Hannibal, do you have hostile intent? \" The response was some audible laughter, before a professional tone was heard. \" Admiral Shepherd, this is Fleet Admiral Hector, and to clarify for you, we're human. After you left, a few years later, we developed FTL technology through something called Subspace. I'd love to tell you about it and catch up with you, old man.

The term \" bomb them back to the stone age\" was an interesting concept since only the human species had ever experienced a stone age and therefore could be the only species to inherit it again. As the elderly human on screen handwashed her clothes in a basin, I was still a bit awestruck in landing a job to work with the last scientist to been privileged to observe human. Coming to this moment was n't just an instance of her previous intern just leaving because he felt he was meant for something better, but having to look further back. To the war against them, the long years of stalemate, the desperate or insane leaders who decided it'd be better to rule a scorched earth in peace rather than share a healthy one in constant war. I do n't know how we survived. Perhaps being a younger new sprung species we had the vitality of youth and wide eyed potential. With the humans they probably felt they've been around long enough. They were tired of defending their right to live when they could n't even defend themselves against each other. So they retreated. In such a way where eliminating the rest of them would be something more horrible than their own attempt at winning at any cost. For some it was pity, for some it was exasperation from the unending war. We left them alone unable to give a killing stroke. And so I watch her washing her clothes, cooking, eating, farming what little food she has left. Playing with what animals have an interest in her but on the whole they usually just acted if she was n't there. But she had been. Millions of people existed to procreate through the life and dangers of this earth, surviving the deaths of other millions to come to this final vessel of this last human. She is alone but continue to live this boring life as if she does n't know what else to do... or perhaps trying to honour those before her by being as normal as possible. She might think no one will know her story, but we will. From her first steps to her last breath, we will see the last moments of the human one day and a time.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Michael stood at the two door wide entrance with an anxious smile on his face, unprepared for what would come. The doors buzzed and the lock clicked open. Michael sighed briefly before opening the right hand door. What he was met by reminded him nothing of the outside view. Where one would expect a thick concrete hallway with blinking half-broken lights was instead a brightly lit marble hallway. The floor was laden with a deep golden carpet, stretching far away into an unseen room. Unsure of what he had gotten himself into Michael took an uneasy step through the doorway. Before he had a chance to question his own gut the doors shut quickly behind him, with the clack of an unseen mechanism he knew there was no point in checking to see if the doors were locked. With nowhere else to go he walked down the marble corridor, with the sound of faint, distant, church hums he was reminded of a cathedral's narthex. After what seemed like a five minute stroll Michael stepped into a massive arching room, in the center sat two bright haired men behind a modest wooden table being illuminated by a strong white lamp. They seemed like the type of nymphs you would find in a long forgotten biblical tale, with small but strong jawlines. As Michael approached the desk he noticed a distinct lack of artificial lightning, looking closer he realized that the men were not blonde as he had previously thought. Instead they both carried what appeared to be crowns of light, filling their brown hair with a deep white light. \" Michael Langrene, the new recruit, right?\" The man on his left said without looking up from his ledger. Michael stared for an intense moment, the bright hue of the crowns attracting his eyes. He finally snapped out of his daze. \" Uhm, yes, I was supposed to report to a Mr. Muzania.\" The man on his right replied with a scoff. \" Yes, Sir Abathar will meet you down the Hall of Weighing. Before Michael had a chance to reply the man on his left replied \" It's right down to your left, past the oak.\" Michael stepped away from the desk and made his way through the arching room. \" Oak?

My appointment was for 5:00pm. What a wonderful display of punctuality by the psychiatrist, Dr. West. I walked to the door and opened it cautiously. \" Why am I here?\" I asked myself. I knew the answer to that question I made a promise to Joanne she said I should talk to someone about my recurring nightmares. I never liked psychiatry I'd expected to get some bullcrap about how my father did n't say he loved me enough. It seemed like a waste of my money, I was n't very well off. I was a pencilpusher in an office, another cog in the machine making $ 12 an hour doing nothing. Then the incident happened. The one you heard about, I told you the story. They called it the reverse rapture, I did n't pick the name you could thank Fox News for that one. I was never very religious, God was n't a concept I really understood until recently. I entered the office and a soft voice met me on my way in \" Noah Davis, I presume.\" I nodded slowly. Dr. West was a beautiful blonde woman with piercing green eyes. She stared deeply at me, it was n't very reassuring. I thought again about my dream about the fear and pain I felt. Corpses raining down from the sky, all recognizable. Joanne, Stephanie, the intern Joseph, Dane from Work. People I enjoyed the company of, friends, family, everyone I cared about. Dead, falling from the sky. It all started after that incident, we had no explanation for it, aliens was the running theory or the US government doing experiments or something. \" So, what can I help you with Noah?\" she asked. \" I'm having nightmares, terrible dreams, night after night.\" I replied. \" And what are these dreams about?\" she inquired. \" The.. Storm... But instead of the unknowns it's my friends and family I'm anxious and afraid.\" I responded with a whisper. Dr. West admired me like a piece of art in a museum. I felt safe, but still uneasy. I was getting antsy so I took a seat. She motioned towards the pitcher of water on the small table in front of me. I put my hand up and waved it to refuse, but she poured anyways. I lifted the glass and guzzled it down, suddenly parched. The water had a sweet flavor I assumed was from the lemon, but that was n't a correct assumption. I fell into a deep sleep. I dreamt again, this was different. I was on a examination table recieving XRays, a small doctor with an impudent gaze and a surgical mask drew blood from my arm. She did n't search for a vein she just knew where to put the needle. I felt panicked like I was gon na recieve terrible news. I was tempted to run, I caved under the pressure and ran as fast as I could out of the room. Blood dripped from my arm leaving a trail on the multicolored tile. I heard a man yell at me in an unrecognizable language it seemed like a mixture of Russian, Korean and Spanish. I got to the exit, but it was locked. I heard a woman's voice with a sweet familiarity she said to me a single word \" Sleep.\" Hearing this I suddenly felt relaxed, my eyelids closed and I fell. I woke up and saw Dr. West confused. \" Are you okay? Do you have a history of narcolepsy?\" she canvassed. \" No, I'm sorry I feel really tired for some reason.\" I answered. \" We can reschedule our session if you'd like.\" she told me. \" I think that'd be for the best.\" I said.

Sometimes you just run away on a writing prompt... ** George Albert Greer slouched back down into his wheelchair. The wonderful sounds of talking and laughing that had filled the room were gone, leaving only the sterile rushing hiss of the air conditioner. The grandfather clock in the next room over clicked and ticked through the thin plaster walls. George had lost many of his faculties over the years, but somehow his hearing had stuck with him. He was thankful for that. Claire had stopped by The Pickwick House on her way back from the boys'school. She did n't do it every day, or even every week, but on those wonderful afternoons when she had the time George almost could n't contain himself. The boys were never too thrilled to come, but George could n't blame them. Pickwick was n't exactly an amusement park. He was lucky that his niece followed her job here to Asheville. During her visits, she'd talk about work, Matt's new house project, the boys'school plays, and the weather. Claire always worried that she was n't saying anything interesting. George savored every word. He just wished he could talk back. The air conditioner clicked off, and the vent's hissing ceased, leaving George in silence. *It's almost 4pm*, he thought to himself. He could expect Nurse Darella's sweet southern accent in just a few min -- \" Well hi there, George!\" Darella proclaimed as she opened the door to his room. The way the vowels rolled slowly off her tongue reminded George of when he first moved to North Carolina after the war. He had never picked up the twangy accent but always loved how friendly it sounded. \" It's a beautiful day outside! But I'm sure you already knew that from your visitors this afternoon. So nice of them to swing by like that!\" George nodded and smiled as Darella squeezed her ample body behind his wheelchair and began to push him out of the room. \" Now that's your niece, right George?\" Darella asked, not pausing for the answer that she knew would n't come. \" She seems like such a nice person. I caught her the last time she was in here, back in April. I may have let it slip that you were my favorite resident. Do n't tell the others!\" She whispered, conspiratorially. Darella wheeled George out into Pickwick House's gardens. George could feel the warmth of the late spring day sink in. He could hear the birds chirping in the trees. It was n't as good as a visit from Claire, but the gardens always put a smile on his face. \" I'll leave you right here under the roof of the porch so you get some shade, okay George? Just ring the bell if you need me, and I'll come running!\" Darella walked back inside. George stared out into the garden. To an outsider of Pickwick House, it was n't much. A few trees, some flowers, a birdfeeder, and a green lawn. Some of the younger residents helped tend it from time to time, but no one was out today. It was n't much, but to George it was paradise. A movement caught his eye. A bush shook, and a tiny figure emerged. The squirrel! A smile crept onto George's lined face. The squirrel was one of George's favorites. Everyday, it would expend so much energy on mischief. Its mission was always the seed in the birdfeeder that hung from a tall branch of the oak tree. But, much to George's amusement, the little devil was always thwarted by the conical metal catcher. Eventually, it would settle for the discarded seed husks on the ground. But every single day, it tried for the big prize. The squirrel stood, looking up at the feeder. Its nose and bushy tail twitched back and forth. George knew it was hatching a devious plan, and smiled. It was always the same plan. The squirrel ran back into the bushes. A second later it emerged, scaling up the trunk of the big oak tree. It jumped as it climbed, twitching and jerking up the bark of the tree. The squirrel reached the thick branch which held the birdfeeder. It perched, deep in thought. George imagined that it was counting down in its head. Three... two... one... The squirrel leapt off the branch, its tiny paws outstretched, aiming to catch the edge of the feeder. *Here it comes*, thought George. The squirrel hit the feeder, resulting in a soft ping. Unfortunately for the squirrel, the conical guard was on a mechanism, one that had been designed to thwart his furry kind the world over. The squirrel had a firm grip on the feeder, but its momentum carried it into a death defying spin, its legs and tail being forced out by the centripetal force. George began to laugh. *Hold on! *, he thought, *you can do it! *. The squirrel was determined this time, but it spun and spun, around the small bird feeder. Suddenly, the small creature's grip slipped, and it was flung off, landing onto the soft green lawn. George let out a guffaw. It was like he had a little circus right here in his backyard. The squirrel stood on its haunches and stared back up at the feeder. It was defeated. *Well now, little guy, we ca n't always have what we want*, George thought. *But you'll succeed some day. And I hope to be here when you do! * Another movement caught George's eye. In a flash, a bright and beautiful bluejay landed on the birdfeeder and began pecking at the seeds inside. George remarked at its subtle grace. It took the bird no effort at all. The bluejay probably had no idea that its friend below risked life and limb every day leaping off that branch. *Well, that's the way of it. Maybe one day you'll see him, Mr. Bluejay. Maybe one day you'll help the squirrel out. I'd sure like to see that! * Then, George saw something he did n't expect. The bluejay stopped pecking, and turned its head. *If I did n't know any better*, George thought, *I'd swear it was looking at me! *. The bird sat there for a moment. Then in a flurry of wing-flaps, it took off from the feeder and landed on the ground right near the squirrel. It cocked its head, looking back and forth between George and the squirrel. George exhaled slowly. *Strange*, he thought. *I do n't think I've ever seen them land so close to another animal like that! * The bird flapped again, guiding itself up to the birdfeeder. It perched, and continued to pump its tiny wings. The birdfeeder began to rock back and forth, slowly at first, and then growing into big rhythmic swings. George heard a click, and watched with astonishment as the birdfeeder snapped off its hook and fell with a thump onto the lawn. The bluejay landed next to the feeder and began to peck away at the fallen seed as if nothing had happened. George glanced over to the squirrel, and his look of shock faded back into a big grin. The squirrel had stopped twitching its tail back and forth, and ( George could swear ) had dropped its mouth in shock. Its day had finally come, and it did n't know what to do with itself. The squirrel bounded over to the feeder and began to stuff its face with the birdseed. George laughed until his sides hurt. *If only Claire were here to see this! *, he thought, *Even if I could tell her, she'd never believe me. Thank you, Mr. Bluejay. You've made for a very entertaining afternoon. * The bird paused from its pecking, and looked up. It began to hop across the lawn toward the porch. Towards George. It stopped about five feet away. George stared back in awe. *How? Can this bird... understand me? * As if in response, the bird fluttered up and landed on the arm of a rocking chair near George. It cocked its head expectantly. George felt his heartbeat quicken. *Could this be real? * *Sing for me, Mr. Bluejay. Let me know I'm not crazy. * The bird perched on the chair arm, cocking its head back and forth. Then, it began to chirp. It chirped and whistled as George stared on, in shock. It sang for three minutes. Tears streamed down George's face again. *Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bluejay. You can go back now. * The bird stopped singing and paused, looking up at him. It flapped its wings and flew back into the trees. George sat. The tears kept coming, but he did n't care. That night, Darella wheeled George back into his room and helped him into his bed. She remarked how happy he looked, and resolved to tell Claire next time that she stopped by how much her visits meant to George. If George could have talked he would've told Darella not to bother, that Claire knew how important they were. That was why she kept coming. George closed his eyes. As sleep began to take him, he smiled. For the first time in three years, he remembered what it was like to speak to someone. The next morning he awoke at sunrise to a beautiful sound. The sound of a bird chirping outside his window.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I would sue of course, but I would n't tell him that until I organised my lawyers. After dismissing this ludicrous scenario, I decided to leave the boat and try and find a way out. If the monster's digestion system was similar to most creatures, there'd be at least one hole leading out. Shame I really could n't see where I could go, but I suppose the mother never told it to install lights through its digestion system in case it swallowed someone who surviv... okay, that's enough of that. So I leaped out of the ship and landed on the squishy flesh of its mouth. I held my arms out in front of me as I moved forward, presumably deeper into the beast. It was hard keeping track of time, but I walked until my legs ached. It was tough going, since the sticky flesh made it difficult to lift my feet. A noise. Not a typical inside-a-monster noise. A sound that sounded much like the sound of someone humming. Since I did n't have much to go on, and I was n't up to much, I decided to try and follow it. A light. I suppose the mother did tell it. I stumbled closer and closer, with the light getting brighter and the humming getting louder. As I turned the corner, that's when I saw him. An old man was sitting on a funny stool at a funny desk, humming to himself. I glanced around the sticky room, and saw a collection of odd objects. Wooden planks and a thin blanket seemed to make a bed, and there were some drawers. There were several candles burning around the room. I must have gone mad. The old man eventually looked back at me, seemingly gave a nod of acknowledgement, followed quickly by a shriek. He stumbled backwards, knocking his stool over. \" What the hell do you think you're doing here?\" he yelled, displaying a collection of hideous yellow teeth. I looked him up and down, still shocked by what I had found. He stood waiting for reply. I continued to stare at him. He eventually gave a smile followed by a chuckle. \" My manners. Hadriel must have swallowed them\" he declared, laughing, and satisfied with his own joke. \" I'd still like to know how you got in here.\" I gradually came to my senses. \" I think I got swallowed by... wait, who is Hadriel?\" \" You're in her. Beautiful, is n't she? Kept me safe all these years\" he said with affection. \" Wait, did n't she swallow you though?\" \" Well, you know. After she tried to eat me anyway.\" The old man walked around his room swinging his arms, before suddenly stopping and running up to me. His face eyes gleamed with excitement. \" You did n't have a boat with you!? Did you!?\" He put his face right into mine, showing off his perfectly hideous face. \" Err, well, yes. It's back the way I...\" \" Glorious Hadriel, wonderful Hadriel. You bless my once more with resources and riches.\" he yelled, as if it would hear. \" You see!? I told you she looks after me.\" I stood staring and then sighed. I felt that I was staring at what was going to become of me. A crazy man trapped in a Hadriel. And what did become of me you asked?

There was a gas tanker on my right so I did the only thing I could. Left. Through the guard rail. Into a dried meadow. Behind me, a loud collision. I checked the rear view mirror. The metal beams the truck was carrying burst forth from the explosion. Through the air. Towards me. I tried to brake, but the car did n't slow down. The beams, 6 inches wide, impaled themselves upright into the field behind and ahead of me. Bits of glass were stuck into my face. My arm collided with the pipe on the way out of the front. Pain. So much. As I saw the tree rapidly approaching, my eyes instinctively closed. Fear? No. Self-hatred. \" Fuck me, I forgot my seat bel-\" My head collided with something soft. I then fell onto the ground, and bounced. Bounced? Soft? After a few seconds, I opened my eyes. Things were blurry. I was in a large room. White, cushioned walls. A soft, robotic voice echoed through the room. \" Interception complete. Mr. Windsor is now ready for debriefing.\" What was this? Was I in the future? Had they finally discovered time travel? Was I saved through teleportation? A wall slid away to reveal a sea of lava. A heat wave blasted into the from the outside. A man in a dark blue suit with a red striped tie entered. A few more blinks of the eye, and I realized he had green eyes, two small horns, and red skin. \" So. Hell.\" No other way about it. I was Christian! What had I done? I thought I had lived a good life of service to God, sure, I had my questions, but does n't everyone? Why am I here? The demon stepped in. The wall slid back, and the heat went away. \" Mr. Windsor. We've been awaiting you. Seems the chap up there wanted to see you so badly, he engineered an accident for you. Doubtless you have so many questions. Yes, you're currently in Hell. Hold out your hand.\" He held up a small medical injector, with red fluid inside. \" No! There's been a mistake! I'm a good Christian! Why am I here? Do n't mark me!\" \" This is actually more of a pit stop. But you do n't trust me, and I understand that. I would ask that you look around at where you are though. Do you really think we would provide you air conditioning if this place was as bad as you thought it was?\" I slowly realized the air was cool again. \" The Devil has many tricks. But seeing as how I'm here... wait. Pit-stop?\" \" Yes. Look over at the next room.\" Another wall slid, and a glass panel showed another room. \" Marie? Oh fuck!\" She pointed up. Her room was similar. No ceiling, and an a elevator in the middle of her room. She smiled at me, and held up her hand to a small scanner. Next to her, a man in white ropes with a halo was packing the same I saw the words \" Marie Windsor\" pop up on a display in green text. The doors slid open, she stepped in, and another man in white robes with wings came out. She took his hand, smiled at me, and the elevator whoosed upwards. \" I'm sorry. Your daughter's dead too. But try to open your elevator now.\"'Fuck, Anna's gon na be pissed at me. What will they tell her when she finds out me and Marie are...'I buried those thoughts deep. There would be an eternity to regret later. I turned. There was a elevator in my room now too. Nothing happened when I held up my hand to a scanner. I looked back. There was a small capsule in the red liquid I had n't noticed earlier. The vial was labelled \" John Windsor.\" \" So is that... my...\" \" It's essentially your room key to Heaven. Your daughter's already on her way up, but I'd like to talk to you for a second first. Your arm, please?\" I held it out. Nothing to lose, I guess. There was no pain as the needle slid into my vein. Should I be surprised? Or not? \" Done.\" I tried my hand on the scanner once more. The elevator doors opened now. The man inside glared at the demon. He turned to me, and smiled. \" You should come as quickly as possible when you're done with processing. Our dear leader would like very much to meet you.\" The Demon opened a door in the wall, seemingly from out of nowhere. He beckoned for me to follow. \" Now, walk with me.\" We stepped out into a long, glass hallway. Thousands of other rooms and elevators stretched off into the distance. How many other people were dying at this second? Going up to Heaven? Staying here in Hell? At what seemed to be the edge of the lava, a glittering city. Above us, clouds and radiant light. *Heaven. * Was I being tempted? \" You're actually in the Unified Security Area. Here, no war occurs, it helps us keep soul processing simple.\" \" Am I going to get to go to heaven soon?\" \" Yes. But you should know that... you might not want to stay. Oh, I've forgotten to introduce myself. Lucifer.\" His green eyes stared into mine. But instead of fear, I felt... relieved? My anxiousness was gone. Why? \" Wait what? You're kidding me. Why? Instead come here and get tortured for eternity?\" He chuckled. \" No, no, no. No torture here. *Freedom. * Have n't you ever wondered how God seems to be a bit... tyrannical? Despotic? Rules, rules, rules? Or punishment? Forever? Seven circles of Hell?\" \" Well... those rules are for our betterment, right? The threat of Hell makes us good servants of Christ.\" \" You should decide for yourself. You can do whatever you want here. Work, play, accomplish all in death that you never had time for in life. Make no mistake, we still have punishment centers for law breakers. But we try to genuinely rehabilitate those in those places. Fix some of the issues Je Ho-vah created them with. Would you have the order of Heaven? Or the freedom of Hell?\" \" Je Ho-vah?\" \" You know him as God. Nobody studies the actual languages anymore. Shame. Ah. Here we are.\" We turned into a small corridor. Three guards in red military uniform and helmets stood before us. Two in front, one in the back. They faced down the corridor. There was a small space in the glass halfway down it. On the other side, two guards stood just next to the line with their backs to the wall. They faced each other, and a third guard looked at the two. The guards on our side wore helmets. They wore military uniforms too, but with caps. There were blue buildings on each side. We entered the one on the left through a nondescript door. A man with wings in a toga was already in the room. Above his head were three star shaped halos. He was flanked by two other angels, but they only had two silver rectangular halos. Lucifer's eyes narrowed as he looked upon the angels. He slid some papers in a manila folder across the wooden, rectangular table to their side. \" I am required by the Afterlife Armistice Agreement to leave now and wait outside. I'll be by the door. Anything you want from me, just call my name. But remember. Freedom, or Order. The choice is yours.\" He smiled, and left me with the angels. \" Mr. Windsor. On behalf of our glorious leader, we welcome you to the afterlife. We do n't usually engage in earlier meetings with humans, but you're... a special case.\" \" What? Was I slated to die later? Has God summoned me?\" \" In time, in time. I'm not allowed to tell you. He will do it himself. But as for an introduction, I think you'll find this video more than enough. A television appeared on the table. The flat screen flashed to life. A news announcer began to exclaim: \" Today marks the 13,798,524,321th anniversary of the founding of the Kingdom of Heaven! Once again, the Kingdom of Peoples'Army is in full march to celebrate the eventual victory over the Satanic devils!\" I saw hundreds, no, thousands of people, forming a giant flag with the colors of their clothes in a giant square. The flag had a circle on the left, with a cross inside it. The words \" Bring Victory to our Glorious Dear Leader and his People\" were emblazoned in multiple languages on giant red banners flowing from balconies. Men and women, led by angels with rifles and swords marched with their knees straight, in perfect formation, perfect synchronization, backed by artillery launchers and tanks. The tanks were flying flags as well. A small icon for the TV station in the corner read \" Official News for the People's Liberators of the Kingdom of Heaven.\" In the background, I could see towers and statues of God waving, playing with children, leading his Armies, crushing Satan under his boot. There were three giant bronze statues holding up golden crucifixes. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The crucifixes intersected, their longer parts forming an X with a line down the middle. The footage cut to another view. God and the Archangels, in robes and military attire, stood on a balcony saluting the crowd. Jesus was riding a white horse, leading the entire army. It cut to Jesus sitting in a chair. He looked at the screen, and began address me. \" Welcome, my son. Welcome to the afterlife. To your place. To eternal worship of God...\" I felt a chill run up my spine. The entire thing seemed familiar, much more eerie than I thought it would be, but I could n't quite place what it was. The rest of the video flew by, detailing the exploits of Jesus and the other disciples. I could n't focus. Something seemed... off. The elevator reappeared. The doors opened. The man in the white robes hailed the angels, then smiled at me. \" Are you finished? Our dear leader would like very much to meet you.\" Lucifer's voice echoed through my head. \" Freedom or Order.

He had introduced the thick, pitch black oily liquid to the members of the ordnance squad on the second week of training. Arriving in the back of an armored freight lorry, complete with a myriad of toxin and radiation warnings; it was unloaded with the tenderness a mothers shows for a new born child. Seven men in hazmat suits, re-breathers and servo harnesses fussed over the barrel and its malicious content, and eventually set it down. Striding over to it with the exuberance of an excited child, Sarge had rushed through the clutch of paperwork and hastily sent away the deliverers. \" Kneelan, your knife\" \" Sir.\" Kneelan replied, handing over his combat knife. With one hand on the hilt of the knife, the other around the edge of the container, Sarge began to prize open the lid; breaking all of the safety seals and, consequently, all of the safety legislation he had just agreed to.

But I could see the house I needed to enter across the street. I could see the evil pouring out of the home. Different shades of red and orange left the windows and underneath the front door. This person needed to be taken out, just like the rest of the evil people I had seen before this one. Their evil seeped out like the foul stench of rotten trash. This monstrosity needed to go. I opened my door quietly and stepped onto the road below. It was a quiet night, all I could hear was crickets and the sounds of other nightly creatures. I turned to shut the door as softly as I could and walked to the other side. In the back passenger seat was my kit, the kit for cleansing an evil spirited human being. I shut the door as quietly as the first and set the kit on my trunk. Inside the case was a pistol and next to the pistol, a silencer. I grabbed the pistol and started to screw the silencer into place, at the same time I was thinking deeply about what I was doing. This was the fourteenth person I had cleansed. I did n't believe in killing innocent people, only the people with the red floating all around them. It was very distinct and noticeable to me, but no one else seemed to see it. It was my gift and I was born to cleanse the earth of it's evil. I shook the thoughts and continued to move swiftly, even though I was doing good, people still looked down on the idea of murder. I needed to be careful and very quiet about everything I did but deep down, I knew I was doing the world a favor. I slid the kit underneath my car and started to walk towards the home. Every step I took almost sounded like it was echoing because of the overwhelming silence all around me. I started to slow my pace, the home was close now. I gradually made my away across the wet grass and towards the front door. The porch steps were quiet under my feet, only boosting my confidence. After reaching the top, I reached for the door handle and gave it a spin. It did n't budge, the door was locked tight.'Fuck.'I thought to myself, looking around for another entrance. It was pretty hot outside, there had to of been a window open. I started searching frantically, my urge to cleanse this person was beginning to take me over. I needed to take this person's life. I walked down the porch steps and made my away around the side, that's when I saw it. A curtain was blowing ever so slightly in the wind. I felt a wave of excitement wave over me, almost smiling at the thought of me getting into the house. I walked to the window and saw that only a screen prevented me from getting in. Luckily, I had a knife on my hip for this exact situation, it was n't the first time after all. I slid the knife down the screen, it was loud but not enough to wake a person from their slumber. Before I got enough cut out a noise inside the house made my body tighten up. I could hear talking deeper in the home, but it was n't conversation between people. I let out a sigh of relief, they had left their television on for the night. I continued to slide the knife through the material and finally reached the end in no time. I pulled myself up slowly, just peeking my head over to get a better look. There was n't anyone or anything moving a muscle, I was clear to go inside. I dropped down and gained the energy to swiftly pull myself into the home. Within no time I was planting my hands down on the floor. It was warm underneath my hands or maybe it was me getting excited, I could never tell. The house was silent except for the television, but it seemed distant, off in another room. From what I could see, I was in some sort of dining room. A table surrounded by chairs stood before me. I cautiously looked around, making sure nobody was sneaking a look at me before I made my move. It was clear, I started to creep through the home. My pistol shook from excitement in my hands, it was almost time to cleanse. I drew myself closer to the sound of the television. It was near now, almost like it was in the next room. I walked through the kitchen and saw the light from the television reflecting off the wall. I started to move faster, they had to of been in the room. But as I started to move faster I got a little careless. My right foot hit something on the floor and the television's volume turned down almost immediately. \" What the fuck?\" Someone said in surprise. I could hear a recliner dropping it's leg rest and someone moving quickly towards me. I did n't have anywhere to go so I aimed the pistol firmly at the doorway. Before I knew it a man, covered in that red aura, walked around the corner. Before he could even open his mouth to say another word, I drilled one round into his skull. \" Another one cleansed.\" I said with a wicked smile that I could n't control.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

My grey cloak gathered around me, my green eyes set upon the exit to the cave, if it could be called that. It was carved with great care, the floor was smooth, and the walls were covered with runes and a Draconi language. I ran my hand over the pictures of dragons in flight, they told stories of dragons past. Certain dragons I recognized, I had been involved with a few stories. Others I had learned of during my studies as a child. \" You wo n't even stay for tea?\" A voice that like a loving grandmother boomed behind me, amplified by the cavern. A smile crept across my face, this was n't an argument I was going to win. I turned to face the voice. She was an older dragon with beautiful rose colored scales, her eyes were a soft golden. Her wings, quite unlike most dragons, had large, albeit sharp, feathers. She looked down at me as she towered high, she was scraping against the ceiling. \" Honored Mother, I'm afraid I have things elsewhere to attend to.\" I knew what was coming next. \" Nonsense.\" She snapped. \" You have n't visited for a few years, you enter my cave and try to sneak away. And you always offer the same excuse, now stop worrying about the outside world for a second and relax.\" Her words echoed through the cave. A strange bone snapping sound came from her as she began to shrink and transform. \" The next time you call me Honored Mother I will box your ears young man.\" Her transformation finished and before me stood an old woman with a nuns outfit. She motioned me to follow and began walking down a tunnel her dragon form was hiding. I followed and we walked for a few moments in silence. We passed more murals depicting different dragons of history, some preformed noble acts, others wicked deeds. We finally emerged into a massive cavern. I use cavern, it was more like it's own world. The inside of a mountain had been hollowed out, and tunnels had been dug in the roof and walls to allow sunshine in. Grass, and trees were growing all around the floor and sloping staircases leading up to alcoves with soft bedding on them. A waterfall fell into a small pond that, in turn, flowed down a river out one end of the mountain. I heard a rustling sound and looked up in time to see a swarm of young dragons dive down from the alcoves and tackle me. I was lost underneath a tangle of limbs, wings, and tails. I heard to laughter of the brood mother behind me, and slowly untangle myself from the multicolored wyrmling pile. \" Children, remember your manners. Our guest is not a pillow to jump on.\" She had a motherly sterness to her voice and the wyrmlings all stood up and looked at us expectantly.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Hello? Wake up! * I cracked my eyes open a fraction, then quickly shut them again as I was blinded by a bright light shining directly in my face. My head was aching as if I had just woken up with the mother of all hangovers. I groaned and rolled onto my back. *Oh good, you're conscious. * I attempted to rub my eyes with my hands, but my fingers contacted something hard a couple of inches in front of my face. I frowned and opened my eyes a little again. It was easier this time without the light directly in my face. There was some sort of glass surface in front of my face. A helmet? I could see my hands in front of my face: they were both covered by black gloves. Gloves? Why the hell was I wearing gloves? Where the hell was I? With a monumental effort, I sat up. My head spun like a top for several seconds and I concentrated on not throwing up. That would be a bad idea with this helmet on. After some heavy breathing, I felt less nauseous and was able to gradually open my eyes once again to look down at my body. I was wearing a spacesuit, and a pretty advanced one at that. Most of my body was covered by what appeared to be black armour plating. On my right arm was a wrist computer with winking symbols all over its tiny screen. There were a few holograms visible in my helmet's visor as well, but they remained largely transparent unless I looked directly at them. My attention slowly turned to the ground I was sitting on. It looked like I had hit the ground hard and ploughed up a furrow of earth several metres long. Looking around, I saw that I was on a low hilltop littered by small boulders and rubble in a steep-sided valley. Overhead, a bright sun was lighting up the landscape. It must have been what was shining in my face when I woke up. I slowly got to my feet, feeling several aches and pains all over my body. A twinge in my chest told me I had at least one broken rib, but it was n't so painful that I could n't handle it. I was trying to probe it with my fingers through the suit's chestplate when a voice spoke in my ear, making me jump. *Feeling better? I used my first aid facilities to help with the worst of it, but you still took quite a lot of damage. * I spun in a circle, looking around for the source of the voice.'Who's there?'I tried to say, but my throat was parched and all that came out was a slight croak. *You're dehydrated. Hold on a sec, I'll give you something to drink. * A metal spigot like that of a hamster bottle suddenly extruded into my field of vision from beneath my visor and pressed against the corner of my mouth. I tested it with my tongue and tasted the cold metallic taste of cold water. I pulled it further into my mouth and began to drink, the liquid sating a thirst I had n't even realised I had. The spigot retracted as soon as I released it, and the voice in my ear spoke again. It was a female voice, I noticed, and it sounded familiar somehow. *And before you ask, it's me, your suit AI. I've been trying to wake you up ever since we landed. *'Landed?'I managed.'What?'*I'm not entirely sure, to be honest, * replied the AI. *I only came online a few hundred metres up. You were going through the later stages of re-entry unconscious, from the looks of things. I had to use up all the propellant for the suit thrusters just to slow us down enough for you to survive. *'What?'I said again, then realised I was n't really contributing much to this conversation.'Where am I? I ca n't remember anything.'*I'm not really surprised. My scans are showing the after-effects of a recent mind-wipe on your good self. Whoever did that probably dumped you in orbit here. *'But *where* is here?'I said desperately, staring around in all directions for some signs of life. *I do n't have too much to go on right now without the stars to triangulate our position. There are no radio signals nearby either, at least none I can pick up with this suit's antenna. At the very least, you're going to have to wait until dark to find out what planet this is. *'Perfect,'I muttered. My head was starting to ache again.'So, what, am I supposed to just sit here until then?'*I would suggest that you make your way off this hilltop, at least. It's rather exposed and I'm getting some meteorological readings that indicate this planet is prone to pretty violent storms. Head over towards the side of the valley and then work your way along it. We'll go from there. * With no other option except to sit in this furrow in the blazing sun, I sighed and started to make my way down the gentle slope. The suit was much lighter than I had thought it would be; I could probably run pretty easily in this. I hopped from boulder to boulder, preventing myself from building up too much speed. *You never mentioned your name, by the way, * said the AI after a few minutes of silence.'Uh, Samuel,'I said distractedly.'Or just Sam, I guess.'*Nice to meet you, Sam, * said the AI. *My official designation is ASE18194068, but you can just call me... Kat. I like cats. *'Well, um, thanks for saving my life, Kat,'I replied. *No problem, * said Kat cheerily. *It's in both our best interests, anyway. * I rolled my eyes as I reached the bottom of the slope and began to jog towards the foot of the nearest cliff. I still was n't sure if Kat's companionship was a boon or a curse. *** The storm rolled in around early evening, or whatever time it was on this godforsaken planet. I was sweaty and tired already from the hours of walking, something the suit's air-conditioning could only do so much to alleviate. Kat had warned me of it even before I saw the first grey-green clouds poking over the edge of the cliff above me, but there was nothing I could do except pick up the pace a little in hope of finding shelter. Then the first drops of water spattered against my visor, followed swiftly by a legion of their comrades falling from the vaporous dropships above. I felt nothing through the suit, of course, but even something this advanced could do nothing about the constant din of falling rain and rolling thunder or the sheer weight of water falling on my shoulders and helmet. The worst part was the visibility, though. The suit helmet had a set of strong headlights, but all they did was illuminate a small cone of raindrops directly in front of me. I could barely see two feet of ground in front of me, and more than once I nearly tripped over a small stone or skidded in a deep runnel carved by the flood. Eventually, after almost half an hour of battling through the elements, Kat suddenly directed my attention to the cliff face to my right. I peered through the darkness to see a large dark hole in the rock. A cave mouth. I stumbled towards it and practically fell through the opening in my haste to get to shelter. It was surprisingly dry in here. The curtains of water falling across the entrance were all channeled into one deep stream that ran along one wall into the depths of the cave, where it disappeared around a corner. I walked over to a handy flat rock in the middle of the floor and lay down on my back with a sigh of relief. *Well done, * said Kat. *You've earned a rest, I think. We'll spend the night here and wait out the storm. I'll wake you for a few minutes when it clears so I can get a reading from the stars. * I nodded sleepily, my mind already sinking into a fatigued slumber. The padding inside the suit inflated slightly to cushion me comfortably, so I had no problem lying on bare rock. *** It seemed like only minutes had passed between when I went to sleep and when I was awoken by Kat's gentle but firm coaxing. I got to my feet and looked out at the landscape outside. The ground was still glistening in my headlights, but the rain had stopped. Everything almost seemed too quiet by comparison. I stepped out about fifteen paces from the cave and looked up to allow the suit's sensors to pick up the stars speckling the sky. After a minute, Kat announced that she had all she needed, and I returned to the cave.'So, what's the verdict?'I said, sitting down on my makeshift bed.'What planet are we on?'*Somewhere called Fherun II, * Kat replied. *We're about two hundred light years from the nearest inhabited planet that I know of. Basically all I have in my records is the name and co-ordinates. They were only updated four years ago, so for all we know there's a colony on the other side of this world that just does n't broadcast radio signals I can pick up. *'So what's the plan?'I said nervously. *Well, I was thinking perhaps we could—* Kat suddenly stopped talking.'Kat?'*Do n't make any sudden movements, * she said. *Slowly turn around. There's something in here with us. * My body rigid with fear, I looked over my shoulder. Something flashed in my headlights before colliding with my helmet hard enough to break one of my headlights and throw me from my seat and onto the floor. I lay there dazed for a moment, then I felt a weight on my chest as someone or something stood on it. A long curved blade of some greenish metal gleamed in the beam from my remaining headlight as its point was directed at my neck, where there was no armour. I swallowed hard and looked upwards, hoping to at least see my attacker's face before I died. Then I saw what was attacking me, and both Kat's scream and my own mingled in my ears.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Hey do you love Renaissance poetry or Tolkien like I do?\" The girl looks at him. \" Hi.\" He looks up and smiles. \" Hi.\" \" Nice bus, huh?\" She asks. \" It's a bus, I guess. I take it to school or work. It saves me from taking a car.\" From the front of the bus the driver yells, \" What the fuck?\" He turns the wheel and the large metal tube swerves and the tires grate against the asphalt. The metal underneath the bus laments and then cracks. The man and the woman fall to the floor. Another commuter crashes into the window and a large gash smiles on his forehead. Rivulets of blood travel down his face. It drips on the floor like the tic tic tic of a clock. The bus driver's face pales and he opens the door to the bus. He exits the bus, walks around the front of the disabled vehicle. The driver lays flat on his stomach and curses. Oil drips into a puddle quickly. He looks up and approaches a figure. \" Hey, what're you doing?\" The figure lurches at him and parts his neck to the side. The teeth tear into the flesh, ripping tendon and vessels. The driver gurgles and collapses. The figure kneels over the body and rips more meat. A cord of muscle hangs from its mouth. The man stands. He helps the woman up. \" You okay?\" He wipes his palm across his forehead. \" I'm fine, but your hand.\" She points. His small finger is bent perpendicular to his hand. \" I do n't feel it.\" He doubles over and tries to straighten it, but the pain begins to take hold. He groans and jerks it quickly, but the finger disfigures more. The man stands. \" Fuck it.\" The woman stares at the other commuter. He wipes at the blood, smearing it. From the front of the bus, the driver reenters. The woman looks at him. \" There's something wrong with him.\" She says. The driver charges and tackles the man. He rips a piece of flesh from his arm. Blood trickles and the crazed bus driver laps at it, clicking his tongue ravenously. The man kicks him off. The woman kneels placing her arms over head as a futile shield. The driver sniffs and refocuses on the wounded commuter. He leaps over the man and grabs the commuter's skull in his hands, twisting the sinews and muscles. The muscles strain and a low vegetable creak slightly speaks and the commuter is silent. The driver licks the gashing smile on the commuter's skull. The woman and the man flee in terror. Traffic around them has halted and screams can be heard from the inner depths of the humanity. A gunshot rings out. Terrified people rush past the man and woman. \" There.\" He points. \" There's a fence and we can shut the gate. They rush into the fenced in area and slide the gate shut. More crazed folk with assortment of viscera hanging from their jowels hiss and scream as they take notice. The woman moves a wheel barrel in front of the gate and takes the man behind an incomplete brick building. They duck down and sit. \" Do you smoke?\" She rises and surveys the area and kneels in front of him. She paces shaking. \" What's wrong with you?\" \" I do n't know. I'm cold.\" His pale face seems to gleam in the darkness of the building. The cries of the damned flood around them like dark-age Gregorian chanting. The girl sits next to him. \" Are you okay?\" She looks at his face and feels his forehead with the back of her palm. \" You feel cold.\" \" You're hard to feel,\" he said. The girl looked at him, she was uncomfortable, and unsure what that meant. His voice faltered with fatigue. To ask would mean to admit she did n't know something, but to just stand there was painful to her. She stood there looking into his brown eyes, saying nothing. \" Can I have a cigarette,\" she asked. \" Sure.\" \" Thanks. Can I lay my head on your shoulder while we wait? I'm a little tired.\" \" Sure.\" They sat down on the hard cement ground, backs against the wall of the building and waited. He tried to rub her shoulder casually, but she moved her shoulder til he stopped. She smoked her cigarette til it was done and then lay her head on his lap and fell asleep. He stroked her head. He sat there not thinking. Not feeling. She slept. From time to time, she would whimper, but remained asleep. The adrenaline wore off her and left her a husk, vulnerable. Because of her sleep, the man put his teeth to her throat and hissed. Her eyes opened briefly, fluttered, and she screamed. The blood splashed into the larger puddle coming from her body.

{"input": "\" This is n't your ordinary magic, dear boy. \"", "output": "The old wizard had lost his touch at least a decade ago. The thunders he used to summon sounded now like bad farts; the fires from his fingertips could start kindling in the fireplace, but not much more. His clientele had moved on to unwithered wizards. I was assistant and could not leave. He had taken me on as a boy, and taught me all he knew. Almost. Three years ago, he closeted himself, even from me. He locked me out of his lab and only emergex to demand supplies: glasswares, mineral powders, coal for the small charm kiln. His lock spells were feeble, but out of love for the old man, I respected them. I continued to run the shop, selling charms and trinkets to passing shoppers, awaiting his passing so that I might begin my own climb to wizardry. Before that day came, though, he emerged from his darkened lab, covered in soot, hacking small black clouds. \" I've done it, boy! It's finished - and so am I...\" And fell over dead, finally overcome by the smokes and gases of his last experiments. His last words to me were \" It's no ordinary magic, dear boy. There's a cord - pull it.\" Of course, it was a few days, after calling the leech wranglers and skin binders, and all confirmed his death was as natural as wizards ever got, and the keys to the shop - and the lab - were mine. I entered his lab with sadness and reverence, but was surprised to find clean and nearly empty. What appeared to be a glass candle, enclosed in a hollow crystal ball, was all that remained on his workbench. Thread of copper lead from it to a box which dangled the cord he had told me of. Hesitantly, I pulled the cord gently, wondering what little thing the old caster had left me. The box clicked. The glass candle glowed. That was all. Disappointed, I went out to the shop and began inventorying, planning for making the shop mine. Nightfall came, and I noticed the lab had not darkened. Indeed, it was more brightly lit than any candle should make it. I went in and looked at the glass candle, still sitting just as before, its glow filling the room. Then I felt it - or actually, did n't. No magic power went out from me to the candle. No magic breath sighed through the room to feed the glass \" flame\". I felt nothing trickled through the copper threads. Where did the light come from? I examined the candle as closely as I dared. A tiny thread, nearly invisibly thin, glowed in the center of the crystal ball. But I had said no incantation, thought no thoughts of power. The old man could not have done it, he was dead. This truly was no ordinary magic. But it would work for anyone. Any powerless knave with a glass candle like this could have his own light. But was this new magic limited to light? Might it perform other magical tasks? I considered what the world would be like if every emptyheaded knave could control magic, and do the wonders now reserved to a studied few. I took a brick from the now-cold kiln, and smashed the crystal candle into glittering sand.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

This was very disturbing and I had to send one of the nurses home because she did not stop crying. A psychologist will talk to the mother to see how she is handling the situation.

The pain returned, something deep in his chest and head, and the unconsciousness returned like a blanket pulled away in the cold morning air. *No. * He thought. *Not just cold. Wet. * Booker's consciousness groaned, and grudgingly reassumed control over the darkness, which faded into a stormy night. Booker was sitting in the back of a dinghy being rowed towards a lighthouse in the middle of a storm. A lantern bounced off of the metal pole supporting it on the bow of the craft, both from wind and the yellow clad man rowing the boat. As he woke up, the yellow clad man in front started talking. \" Are you going to just sit there?\" He had a learned voice, like you'd expect from an Oxford boy, or an Ivy league man. Booker was about to tell him to buzz off, when a woman's voice, with the same accent responded. \" As opposed to what? Standing?\" Booker had n't seen her, in her matching yellow slicker. He had thought they were one person at first glance. \" No, rowing!\" The man pulled on the oars which moved sluggishly through the angry water. \" Rowing? Had n't planned on it.\" She turned as she said this, holding a box out to Booker. It was the box he had gotten for his service in the action at Wounded Knee as a new addition to the 7th Calvary. \" So you expect me to shoulder the burden?\" He asked, somehow managing to sound both incredulous and disingenuous at the same time. \" No, but I do expect you to do all the rowing.\" \" And why is that?\" He asked petulantly, pulling on the oars again. \" Coming here was your idea.\" \" *My* idea?\" \" I made it very clear that I do n't believe in the exercise.\" \" Rowing?\" \" No, I imagine that's wonderful exercise.\" \" Then what?\" \" The entire thought experiment.\" Booker could n't even begin to understand what these two fools were babbling about, much less why the people who had hired him also trusted *these* two to take him to the location. \" Excuse me! How much longer?\" He said loudly, trying to get the two to stop their incessant chattering. His attempt caused only a momentary pause before he was completely ignored. \" One goes into an experiment *knowing* one has failed.\" \" One does not undertake an experiment knowing one *has* failed.\" *These people are helpless... * Booker thought, and decided to turn his mind towards more productive matters at hand. He popped a latch on the box he was given and opened it. Inside were several items, most prominently his Mauser pistol, one of the newer semiautomatic variety. He pulled the action back to cycle a round, then put it in his chest holster where it belonged. There was a notecard with the drawing of a set of binoculars, a key, and a sword with three x's under them, and a one, and two twos under the x's. A post card was pasted next to this card, from a place called \" Monument Island\". Another picture and a key with a cage emblem on the handle were also in the box, along with the coordinates to New York and some strange looking silver coins. \" Can we get back to the rowing?\" The man said, giving in to exasperation. \" I suggest you do, or we'll never get there!\" Booker picked up the next item of interest, a picture of a girl, maybe in her twenties. She was n't bad looking, she almost looked like a young French girl. Or, what the talkies would have you believe French girls looked like.'Elizabeth'was written on the top of the photograph. \" No, I would greatly appreciate it if you would *assist*!\" Booker flipped the picture around. On the back,'Take to New York Unharmed'was written in pen. Booker put the contents of the box in his pocket. \" Perhaps you should ask *him*.\" The woman said, obviously annoyed at the constant pestering. \" I imagine he has a greater interest in getting there than I do.\" \" I suppose he does. But there's no point in asking.\" The man suddenly sounded more thoughtful, the exasperation had vanished from his voice. \" Why not?\" \" Because he does n't row.\" The man replied ponderously. \" What do you mean,'He does n't *row*?\" \" No. He *doesn't* row.\" \" Ah. I see what you mean.\" The woman's exasperation also vanished, and the duo remained silent. A dock house crept out of the fog surrounding the lighthouse, and their little dinghy pulled alongside the rickety looking thing. \" Ah. We've arrived.\" The woman quipped. Booker pulled himself onto the dock as the couple began rowing away. \" Shall we tell him when we'll be returning?\" The woman asked her counterpart. \" Would that change anything?\" The man asked. \" Might give him some comfort.\" \" At least there's something we agree on.\" They were vanishing back into the fog, and the rain did n't let up. There was no one in sight of the dock. \" Hey!\" He yelled. \" Somebody meeting me here?\" \" I'd certainly hope so.\" \" It does seem like a dreadful place to be stranded.\" *What a useless bunch. * Booker thought, turning his attention towards the lighthouse. \" Maybe there's someone inside.\" Booker tried not to fall on the old slippery wooden dock as he made his way to the rock the lighthouse was built on. The door was illuminated by a sickly looking yellow lamp whose meager yellow light was occasionally overwhelmed by the intense white-blue light of a bolt of thunder. There was a note pinned to the door, a little speck of blood on the corner. It read:'Dewitt- Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt!

Once he had spent ten minutes pondering over this, he fetched a book out of his satchel. Last month he had found this book in a ditch next to The Crucible Theatre. It was a dark purple coloured book and the old and worn front cover contained one word: Magic. When Ted had found this intriguing book he thought it was going to be his big breakthrough. Unfortunately, the contents of the book were in Latin and because Ted was wrongly kicked out of school at the age of ten for supposedly setting the staff room on fire he had not had the opportunity to learn the language.

{"input": "\" Put the money in the bag and no one has to die. \"", "output": "\" Is that so?\" Will heard himself say back to the man, while maintaining his gaze on the monitor in front of him completing the process for the previous transaction. Turning towards the voice his eyes grew wide as he noticed the black handgun pointed directly towards his chest. A large masked man stood before him on the other side of the counter. It looked like he held a 10mm pistol in his hand. Will did n't know guns for shit, but he was a gamer and recognized the design from this open world RPG he had recently completed. The man was wearing a plain black hoodie that was zipped almost to the top revealing a white T-shirt underneath. He had a dark pair of bluejeans on that had several small holes scattered down the pant legs. Will saw the man's skin was white. Will's bladder broke and he began shaking noticeably as warm liquid started to flow down his leg. This robber was n't wearing the balaclava type mask that you would see in the movies or on a TV show. He was wearing a spherical faded yellow mask that simply showed a smiling face. It looked exactly like the smiley face emoticon he would send through text messages on his iPhone, only for the faded color and the spots. What must have been dried blood splatters and stains were visible all over the surface of the mask. It had been washed, sure many times, but the distortions of the color left a disturbing pattern to those unfortunate to get close enough to view it. Will felt the large jet black eyes blankly peering into his own, beyond his own. He pondered that the dumb pencil thin smile underneath radiated a vibe that would uproot giant oak trees and send them running. *Where's your smile? * Will heard this in the deep part of his subconscious. He was n't sure but he thought the mask was speaking to him. Not the man underneath the mask, but the mask itself. Why else would that god-damn cliche his manager frequently used whenever he felt one of the employees needed to perk up be circulating in his thoughts right now. *LET ME SEE THAT SMILE! * Will flinched. The mask must have shouted this into his conscious, because the man robbing him had remained perfectly still. Looking up to meet the gaze of the mask, the right corner of Will's mouth lifted to show a forced grin. Suddenly, the hand that was n't holding the gun grabbed the barrel and the robber spun the gun around before smashing it across Will's grinning face. \" Yes that is fucking SO ya dumb shitbag, da fuck you smiling for?\" the robber yelled after pistol whipping the cashier. The robber, seeing he knocked the cashier down, then began looting the drawer the bank used for its withdraws. As Will lay on the floor below the drawer, it closed. The masked peered over the counter and looked down on him, still smiling. He thought he could see a few new splatters on the mask, and one of the splatters had a thin streak of fresh blood running down the right side of the face.

The sound of death. Everyone dove to cover at the sound. Everyone but Price. The private stood limply in the front yard, gazing into the street before him as if nothing had happened. Price was a boisterous lad from Halifax whose ego was as loud as he was clumsy, and as clumsy as he was stubborn. The sniper across the street had determined the same thing and made his own understated reply. Voices from inside the house were whispering, hissing for Price to get back inside just a minute ago. But now they shouted with.303. \" Wilson, on me, keep the pressure on'em boys!\" barked a mustached officer as he darted out the front door, followed by a rookie with a clean uniform. Private Price was still standing there, the color drained from his face, his hands weakly on his chest as if he had a cold. It was n't until they'd grabbed each of his arms that his legs buckled and he fell forward, blood pouring from the fresh, mangled maw in his chest. The Lieutenant and Wilson struggled to drag the burly Haligonian back inside the house. Robicheau and Semyenovich dove away from the windows and helped the trio maneuver into the kitchen, where they all collectively dropped Price onto the hardwood table. The night before, Price was in good spirits, and his laugh felt as though it were louder than a German barrage. But today he wheezed, gurgled as his lungs struggled to survive the next exhale. Wilson ripped the curtains from the window and balled it up, trying to curtail the bleeding as much as he could. But his blood pooled in his chest and seeped out of his back, leaking onto their boots. They panicked, buzzed around like bees as they tried to find anything to extend Price's life. Robicheau felt something grab at his arm, and he looked down to see Price's bloodied hand on his sleeve. He weakly tried to speak, but even blinking seemed difficult at this point. Robicheau saw Price's Adam's Apple gulp furiously, before he closed his mouth, and the grip on his sleeve loosened. It was at this point that Private George Price breathed his last, his gaze permanently glazed on Robicheau. Robicheau slammed his fist on the table, causing the others to turn and make the same realization. Wilson threw his curtains, but they remained silent. A minute later, the Lieutenant returned from the other room, waiting before making his case. \" The whole thing's over, boys,\" he sighed, producing his pocket watch. \" Jesus Murphy,\" he choked as he turned away from them, sauntering toward the fireplace and resting on the mantle. The others gradually turned away from each other, walking to other parts of the house. When they returned to camp, they scarcely talked and drifted further apart. They knew it would be a long ride home to their families, to Canada, to normality. Their wives, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, friends, would ask them about their time \" over there,\" and they tried their best to explain. None could fathom this terrible irony which they felt in their hearts: Their exhilaration, the relief that they had survived this abominable thing, held back by their unbearable thirst for vengeance, stolen from them at the very end by a watch and a treaty.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

A playing card.\" \" Which one.\" \" Queen. There was also a receipt for a book bought in Oakland. Place called New Harbinger Publications. Paid in Cash.\" Waters skims through more photos but does n't see anything of interest: A casino chip hidden in the mouth. Something typed up tucked into a pocket, it reads *\" who in the world am i thats the great puzzle\" *. \" Any idea what the book was?\" \" Nope. That place is n't a Barnes and Noble, though. It's a store that specializes in self-help. They also publish from those that have mental illnesses.\" \" From regular people.\" \" Well I would n't call them *regular* if they're in need of help.

Waters is driving, leaving Rogers to eat his lunch with greater ease. After a couple of hours through traffic they make it to the store. \" Hello gentlemen. How may I help you today?\" \" I'm in need of some help.\" \" We have a large variety of self-help books. Is there anything in particular you're looking for?\" \" Actually, it's more official than that.\" Waters flashes his badge quickly to the woman at the counter, \" Detective Waters-\" Before Rogers could do anything besides a quick sidelong glance, Waters says, \" -and my partner Detective Rogers.\" \" I'm just an hourly worker I. There's not much I can do, I just run the register. Let me get the manager.\" \" Please.\" She smiles primly and leaves quickly to the backroom, leaving both the detectives standing before the counter. Rogers whispers angrily to his partner, \" What are you *doing*, Detective\" He smiles self-assuredly, \" Following a lead\" \" This is n't exactly following protocol\" The manager comes from the back and looks at both detectives, \" Yes, is there anything that we can do\" Waters steps forward with the receipt, \" Following a lead on a potential suspect. I'd like to know what book was bought, and a physical description of the customer, if you have one.\" The managers takes the receipt and puts on her reading glasses, \" I'll have to look it up in the computer. It'll just be one moment.\" \" Please, take your time. Is it alright if we browse?\" \" You may browse the store.\" The manager writes down the ISBN of the book that was listed on the reference page of items sold at that specific time/date. While she writes down the numbers, both detectives peruse through the library of books displayed on the shelves. She has the title in mind and looks to find them. \" Detective? I've found the book. If you would follow me.\" She leads Waters through the aisles and rows, moving from section to section. Waters follows closely behind as they go down an aisle, passing an \" S\" marker. \" Here it is, Sublett, Jesse: Never the Same Again\" as the manager picks out the book and hands it to him. Waters flips the book to its back and reads aloud, \" On a hot August night*blahblahblah*was onstage *lamuhduh*The next day*dadeeda*found... girlfriend... murdered in their bed. Huh.\" \" That's one of the more grim selections we have. Most of our books are generally much more uplifting than that.\" \" Do you remember what he looked like, the man that bought this book.\" \" I was n't the one that sold the book to him. You'll have to ask our sales clerk. Now if you may excuse me, I have to get back to work.\" Waters flips through the book as he makes his way to the counter. He looks back up asks, \" Did you work on this specific day?\" She looks over to Detective Rogers as he says, \" It'll be ok. There's nothing to worry about.\" She peers down to the receipt and looks at the timestamp. \" I dunno, I might've. Lem me check my phone... Yes, I did.\" \" And did you remember anything off that day. Maybe a customer who looked out of sorts, or unusual.\" \" No-not, not really.\" \" Are you *sure*.\" She looks up and away to the right, towards the ceiling, \" Wait! There was one guy, he asked'Do you have anything by Charles Dodgson'. I said'I'm not sure but I can look it up on the computer'. He said something like'it would mean so much to me'. \" And.\" \" And I found no authors under that name. He got a little upset.\" \" How little?\" \" Ok he got a lot upset. He started screaming, saying that he put his heart and soul into that memoir. I sold him that book you're holding and told him to have a good day.\" \" Hahah, I like your humor.\" \" No, I did n't mean it like that. But then I asked the manager about anything by Dodgson. She said it sounded familiar.\" \" May we go to the back and talk to the manager again?\" \" Sure. It's through the door, to the end of the hall, last door on the left.\" \" Thank you... Grace.\" A curt knock on the door of the manager's office breaks Sylvia out of her work, \" Yes, Grace. What is it this time.\" \" I'm sorry, but it's Waters.\" \" Come in, Detective.\" \" Grace was slick, now that she remembered more of the suspect. But we need your help. However, it's late and we must get back. I want you to find anything you can about submissions by'Charles Dodgson'. Grace said the man became upset and blurted that he was rejected.\" \" Of course, Detective. Is there any way I could reach you. It'll take some time, as I'd have to sift through correspondence, physical and digital.\" \" Sure sure. Here's my card.\" \" I see that you work at San Francisco P.D.\" Waters smiles sincerely, \" We're corroborating with Oakland.\" \"... I'll start the first thing tomorrow. I'll have to call in another manager to help cover while I look through our history.\" \" Thank you, Sylvia. I hope to hear from you soon,\" as Waters closes the door behind him and heads to the counter. He meets back up with Rogers, and gives *Never the Same Again* to Grace, \" I'd like to purchase this, please. You know, Grace. You have quite the memory.\" She smiles meekly and blushes, \" Thanks Officer. Detective.\" \" Officer Detective, I like that. Sounds much more officiative.\" \" I, I do n't think'officiative'is a word.\" With a wink, Waters leaves the store, holding the book in its little plastic bag, \" Alright Rogers, your turn to drive,\" as he tosses the keys to his partner. It's a long quiet drive back to the department. Waters skims through the book he just bought, while Rogers is reticent. Even the radio is turned down, barely a whisper above the sound of life on the 580 to the San Fran-Oakland Bridge. Waters murmurs along to a song on the radio, \" Once I had a love and it was divine. Soon found out I was losing my mind \". Waters notices the atmosphere is chilly, even though it's a balmy 90 degrees, \" I had to, Rogers. \" \" You *had* to. \" \" Yes, you know how long it takes for departments to work together, let alone look at something as minor as a sales receipt.

When he was first told by the Attikos Hellenas, or the Greek secret intelligence, that he was to inform the Olympians of their imminent eviction, the man would not believe his years. *Olympians. * And as the two weeks of preparations went on, he convinced himself that the visit was mostly ceremonial. He was to climb the mountain, checklist some papers, and assure the Greek people that their gods acquiesced. So far, the palace surprised him. He did not expect the Olympus palace to be real. George hesitated for a moment as he weighed his chances of being incinerated by some ancient powers for intruding on them uninvited. Then he remembered his priorities. He walked into the throne room. The room was massive. The ceiling was so high it was as if George was looking at a hollowed-out skyscraper. Giant monolithic columns cut across the room in a shape of a U... *thrones*, he corrected himself. These were empty thrones, each seated, or once seated, a mighty Greek god. He looked around, hoping to catch any sign of life... or something grander. As he scanned the place, he noticed that the room was unusually spotless. Even as the thrones looked as if they were about to crumble, the floors were devoid of debris and the fire at the center of the room was still crackling with heat. *Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair*, lamented George, as he took out his checklist. *rustle* There was a rustling sound behind George. Startled, he turned around to see an old woman, shrouded in grey, sweeping the floors. She took no notice of him, but the inspector did not remember seeing her when he first scanned the room. First confused, then confounded, George walked up to her. As he neared her, she looked up at him and gave him a smile. She looked like she had been here for a long time, and by the looks of it, she was the one that kept the place tidy all these years. \" Sorry to bother you, but...\" George hesitated, perhaps finding it ridiculous now that it was about to be spoken out loud. Then he continued: \" Do you happen to know where I can find the Olympians?\" The old woman initially replied in Greek, but when she realized that George did not understand a thing that she said, she replied again, in tattered English. \" Others leave, a long time ago.\" \" Others? Are you an Olympian, then!?\" The old woman smiled sadly, and shook her head. \" First sea-shaker, then hunting-girl, then great mother. They all leave, one by one. Only one remain.\" The woman pointed at the sky in the center of the room. *Zeus*, thought George. He was the god of the skies. Of course *he* would never abandon his seat of power. \" I'm sorry to say this, but we - the Greek people have decided that all the gods must move out of mount Olympus. It is to be bought by the European Union as a heritage site and as a... actually, there is a notice here, in Greek.\" George took out the letter grade paper that held the census, agreement and signatories. The old woman pursed her lips as she looked over at the document. \" Why would Hel- Greeks want to take gods out?\" \" I do n't know the exact details, ma'am. But I assure you, this document is real.\" An oracle, he decided. Briskly, the old lady led the inspected onto the central fire, and they faced each other across the fire-pit. \" We consult them of this news.\" And with that, she threw the document into the fire. *And that's why we print multiple copies*, George mused as he watched the paper burn in the fire. Sometimes people liked to think that without any evidence, the agreement would cease to exist. \" Excuse me, but I thought you said that the gods died. How would you consult them?\" The old woman laughed. It was a very melodic one for an old woman. \" I say leave, not die. Gods can not die! Gods are here!\" \" But I thought you said that they le-\" A roar of fire interrupted their conversation, and George took a leap backwards. The woman was unmoved, her eyes deep into the fires. Tendrils warped around her as the flames engulfed the central atrium. \" The gods have decided that they will leave. If Greeks do not want their gods anymore, then they will find other Greeks that do want them. He has spoken.\" As the fires died down, the old woman looked wearier than ever. She looked down at George with her sad old eyes. \" He is proud, the thunder-maker. He does not know that Greeks need him and he needs them. But he has spoken.\" With that, the old woman started to leave for the exit. Still a bit flustered, George stumbled to his feet and followed her. \" Wait, where are you going?\" \" Olympus is no more. I leave.\" \" But you were the only person that kept this place clean, how...\" The old woman turned towards the inspector, and at that single moment George sees a vision of heat and fire protruding from her grey, old eyes. A moment later, everything was back to normal. \" I leave.\" And then George stopped talking. He looked downwards. Perhaps it was a feeling of humbleness. He did not know. The old woman put her hands on his chest. It was some kind of sign. \" Gods leave, but gods will always be here. You are good man. Georgos of England. Good luck.\" With that, the woman walked out of the room, leaving George to his thoughts. *So it is done. * He did not feel accomplished at all. He looked back at the room again. It was darker. The fire in the central hearth had extinguished, making the place feel emptier than before. With a turn, he walked out of the room.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

My initial worry was that your vernacular would n't hold up as the story progressed. I was pleasantly proven wrong. The language of your story really bolsters it. It's consistent, smart, and does n't get in the way of reading. The characters are written believably and dialogue is engaging. Huck, Vivianna, Donahue, Billy, and everyone else were interesting characters that all had some good progression. All in all the story reminded me of this movie I used to love as a kid called, For the Love of the Game, which is also a story about an aging pitcher throwing a perfect game. As the story jumped around from past and present I could n't help, but think this reads just like that movie. I'll always enjoy a good story centered around baseball.

Running until you can't run any longer? There is no place to hide they're everywhere. They come out from beneath you or above you; you never know where to look. It was bad enough when they were just mindless idiots, but now that actually think and strategize, there is no way to survive this apocalypse. They're using the same technology and weapons we use, they outnumber us, and they don't need to worry about others. If I could just get to the submarine we saw yesterday maybe just maybe I could survive this. Problem is it's at least two days away from me. That means not only do I need to try to get somewhere safe to sleep but I have to get there before any other survivors get there and take it, or anything else for that matter. I'm going to attempt to sleep on the subway tracks. The trains no longer operate and the tracks are so extensive that even if something was down here it should be incredibly hard to see me in the darkness. I set my pack down and lay my head on it. I shouldn't sleep for more than two maybe three hours or so. I'm just built that way now; you need to be if you want to survive. In my rest I hear something. I know it can't be a train because they don't run but it sounds like a person; a group actually. I try to get up and run but I'm just too tired. It wasn't until they started to tear into me that I jolt up but I'm not in the subway any more. I'm in a field looking at a night sky. I look over, the group is still here and Mark is standing watch.

When he described some of the stories he'd written, I felt a grief in my heart. A sorrow for all the wonderful characters who'd died of neglect. They'd starved to death in my mind. Birthed with hope and then forgotten. There was me who'd really enjoyed what happiness drugs seemed to provide. His teeth were gone and his hair was matted. He had scabs all over his skin and what teeth remained in his skull were black with rot. He was the only one sitting among us. He was wasting away and one of us had taken pity on him, realizing of course that we all could have ended up like him. We were him. I'd realized then that I could be whichever version of myself I wanted. This version that is typing away is the one that took the middle road. The one who shied away from anything difficult lest he fail and be mocked. Even the version of myself who'd wasted away his youth and talent with drugs and alcohol and god knows what else- was not afraid. I left through the portal and climbed safely back into my own bathroom. I was safely back in my own existence determined to do whatever the hell I wanted to do. Free from fear and shame.

Yet you're unaware, unable to differentiate between real life and hallucinations brought on by the drugs.", "output": "My name is Tara and I am 28 years old. I have vowed to never touch drugs again. But that is not where this story begins. This story begins on a normal day at my job as a clerk at Pet Heaven. Sunday shifts were my favorite and they were new. The store received a handful of complaints about the store not being open on Sunday morning. The owner just figured most people were in church, worshipping Jesus. I don't know where most people were, but they weren't in a pet store on a Sunday morning. And I loved where people weren't. And I loved animals. Especially when I was high. Normally, I only worked a 4 hour shift, starting at 8am. I opened and was normally out by 1pm and had very few customers. But this Sunday was different. I had forgotten I had agreed to an 8 hour shift. Let me take a step back. Saturday nights are always crazy. Jared always has the best shit. But Jared has been out of town for months. We don't talk much so I think he went to San Francisco, but others say he went to prison. But he was back this Saturday. And Jared has the best shit. So I knew I had to work in the morning, but I always come to work that way on Sundays. How I to know this Sunday would be any different? I was dead tired when I arrived at Pet Heaven. I fell asleep at 5am and woke up to my cell phone alarm and ran to the subway stop by 7:30am. There was no one on my subway car besides me. When I go to the shop, I realized I had forgotten my key. This was not the first time I had forgotten my key. Knowing this, I always left the upstairs window unlocked. I could easily climb the fire escape and get in that way. But that is when I first became dizzy. I should have known then something was wrong. But I didn't. I didn't realize until about a week later. After the hospital. But as I said before, Jared's always has the best shit and he had been out of town. So perhaps my tolerance was totally gone. I managed to climb the fire escape and went into the window. Actually, I fell into the window. My shoulder hit the tile floor with a thud. The fire escape led to a bathroom and I'm lucky I didn't hit my head on the toilet. I stood up and grabbed my makeup out of my bag. I hated makeup, but I wore it to mask that fact that I looked totally out of it. I checked my cell phone for the time, 750. Only 5 minutes to put makeup on with a shaking hand. I finished and ran down the stairs. Customers rarely showed up at 8am, so I had time. But I also had to feed hungry animals. The fish were first. I shook 15 containers of food into the fish tanks. The next were the rabbits and gerbils. I gave little pellets of food to them. That's when I noticed the first customer. He was a regular. He was a heavy man and he didn't take care of himself. He smelled like he hadn't showered in days and his shirt looked stained with urine of some kind and greasy potato chips. He had a few cats…judging by copious amounts cat food he purchased, at least 15 of them. Or maybe he ate it. Who knows? I walked over, unlocked the door and he came in. \" My babies are almost out of food. Got a new baby over the weekend and she ate so much more than I expected. \" I nodded and steadied myself on the door handle. I made it over to my register and made a mental note of what animals still needed fed. The reptiles and birds. Snakes, lizards, parakeets and parrots. I fumbled the register password three or four times. Finally, it let me in and I filled the drawer with cash. \" Excuse me, miss. Excuse me. \" He raised his arm and even five feet away I could smell the stinch. \" You all are out of my babies'favorite cat food. Feline Delight. \" \" Okay I'll check in back. \" I knew we had Feline Delight. The night shift on Saturday was supposed to stock for the upcoming week, but apparently they didn't. Just another thing for me to do. And I was feeling queasy and confused. Everything felt so slow and the world was spinning. I walked to the storage room and sure enough, all of this week's stock was just sitting there. I grabbed 2 bags, hoping that the customer didn't want 3 and threw it on a cart. Normally, I could carry two bags but I wasn't risking it. I pushed the cart to the front of the store. \" Feline Delight, just for you \" \" Thank you dear. Let's see, I got a coupon. Can you do that? It expired yesterday, but you can take it can't you? \" It was going to be one of those days. Which never happened on a Sunday. And I was so freaking high. The customer paid and walked away. But he appeared to be floating now. His legs were absent. Just a giant belly with a gross shirt floating out the door. I checked my phone for the time again. 8:30am. I hit my head against the counter, only 3.5 hours to go. See, at this point, I hadn't realized yet that I had to work until 4:30 pm. No… it wasn't until later. The work must have been quiet because the next thing I remember is falling asleep in a chair next to the register. I woke up to the bells made by the incoming doors. I checked my cell phone. 9:30am. I had been asleep for an hour and still hadn't fed the rest of the animals. The customer was a lady and a little boy. And he was loud. \" Mom. Mom. MOMMMMM. I want a fish. A cute fish. I'll name him Nemo. Like that movie. Finding Nemo. You know the one, Mom? With the fish. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Nemo the fish. Actually, Mom. I want a gerbil! A cute gerbil. I could name him Jeter, like the baseball player. We could even buy him a baseball and a hat. \" The kid went on forever. The mom didn't even acknowledge him except for \" Uh-Huh, yep \". As it turns out, they weren't real customers. The mom just took the child out as an excursion. It was cheaper than the petting zoo and you still go to touch the animals. I was relieved. While they were looking at fish, I decided to feed the birds and then the snakes. A crashing sound came from the end aisle. The child looked different than before. His head was the size and shape of beach ball. He now had tiny eyes and fat lips. \" Sorry lady. I dropped some stuff. \" His mom now had lanky arms that reached down to her feet. \" Come on, son. Let's leave. She'll clean it up. \" And they walked away. I wasn't expecting this many hallucinations. Jared must have laced his shit with something. Maybe he really did go to San Francisco. The damage from the aisle wasn't that bad. It was just some aluminum water bowls. I picked it up and checked the time. It was 10am. I finally had time to feed the lizards. When I got to the last lizard, a gecko, he was lying there, dead. I knew it wasn't my fault for feeding him late, but I felt terrible. I am such a softie when it comes to animals. I cried for about 15 minutes. Sooner than I realized, it was 11:30am, almost time for my break and almost time for my co-worker to show up. I checked the shift sheet. It was Anita. I hated her. She was my least favorite co-worker. She was a sweetheart, but loved to blame people. She hated drugs, alcohol, curse words and secular music. She used to be scheduled for the morning shift, but she emphasized her need for church on Sundays. I just didn't like her. It was then I realized that I had to work till 4pm. But I had no time to react, because at that moment, something walked through the door. It looked like a lizard. It had green scales, a spiky face and deep yellow eyes. But it was wearing a dress. And high heels. My eyes could not move from the lizard. It was shorter than me. In complete confusion, I took a food bowl and hit the lizard over the head. The lizard went down without a fight. I took off its shoes and found a dog crate. I did not think lizards could be so large or why it would wear dresses. I locked it in the dog crate and put it in the storage room. I didn't want to scare customers away. I also didn't want to call my boss. I was still feeling a little light headed and didn't want him to suspect anything. I would call him about the giant lizard later. EDIT: GRAMMAR", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Write about a particular important discovery.", "output": "Looking down at the creatures used to be something of a pleasure, they were simple, their ideas and concepts focused on the now. I had created them to relax myself, and to give me something to do as the eon's passed by in the timeless void. At first having risen up form the mud of the planet the fought and warred with one another over the simple concepts of mates and food. I watched as generation after generation followed in the footsteps of the one before. I looked away from them for an instant however to see what the rest of creation was like, to see what my own mind had wrought beyond the simple creatures. Points of light in the far off skies, blazing streaks of light that shot through the sky scaring the creatures on a regular schedule, small pieces of rock in the void not unlike the one they inhabited but dead and devoid of anything interesting. I watched what I had created and turned back to the creatures bored with the sky. Turning back I was for a moment stunned, they were no longer rolling in the dirt and fighting over simple concepts like mates or food instead they were spread across the world inhabiting ever corner of it. They now warred in massive droves, pieces of earth strapped to their chests as they stained the ground with blood. Greater and harder pieces of earth then I had ever convinced were spun in their hands as they killed and warred. Interested I watched as their warring grew in complexity, hurriedly I gave them weapons more weapons to fight with, the simple addition of elements which reacted in puffs of and exploded outwards entertained their own instincts and my own desires for hundred of years. I could not however shake the feeling that something was wrong. In one of the deserts of the planet I watched as they prepared to once again advance their art of war, they had peered through instruments at the smallest things I had bothered to create. A man had a moment ago described them as the smallest thing by which an object could be divided, for the creatures though that had been thousands of years ago and across the world. They dropped their experiment, and for a moment I considered letting nothing happen. They could not break the fabric of reality. But in a moment I of weakness I could not let their endeavors be in vain. Hurriedly I unraveled one of the rules I had made, letting the creatures own imaginations fill the void where mine had been lacking. I watched as they split my reality, in a terrific flash of light and sound. They cowered behind their protection but I watched in awe. A moment latter they used the new creation to destroy others just like when I had given them the elements. For a small a mount of time they experimented with the weapon of their own creation, but for the first time in history as far back as even I could remember they were afraid to use it again to kill. They laid the weapons aside their own minds had created a weapon to horrific for them to use. They turned their heads towards me and I realized my mistake to late, swinging their weapons towards me they peered up into the heavens and created a heaven to complex for me to have conceived. On pieces of paper they convinced of voids where the universe I had created was torn to shreds. They looked out further than I ever had and saw the edges of my creation. The looked closer at what I had made and built massive weapons to destroy the very smallest elements of my creation making things smaller then I had ever considered. I had no more power, I had no hold over them, they had become the god's and me the subject of fascination as they watched and slowly dissected me. +++++ So my first post here, how did I do?

Three items. Where is that item? I know I had it last night, he thought. Charles opened up a drawer and pulled out two items: a 10-minute hour glass and a magnifying glass. \" This is the first step, \" Charles said, placing the hour glass onto a night stand and handing the magnifying glass to Death, who was now sitting on a chair rubbing his head where it hit the ceiling. \" These are not even close to the items you need to find, Charles, but I'll play along. \" Charles flipped the hour glass over and told Death to stare at the falling sand using the magnifying glass.

Go wipe down some tables.\" He stepped up to the machines, and gave the girl a long look. \" One grande, iced, sugar-free, vanilla latte with soy milk, and...\" Something like a smile pulled gingerly at the corners of his mouth. \" Two pumps of caramel syrup.\" Then he set to work. ________________________________________________ \" Thanks,\" she said flatly. She tore the cup from the manager's hand and swiveled on her heel to leave, her white sundress twirling around her with discordant grace. \" Have a nice day,\" said the manager. ________________________________________________ \" I'm sorry I got you pulled out here, but I just did n't know what to do. She did n't want sugar, but she wanted caramel, and I --\" I waved to cut the poor kid off. I'm used to the newer employees having trouble with problem customers. \" I know. You have n't been here long, so I'll let you in on a trade secret. The longer and more complicated a customer's order, the less they probably care about the particulars. That's the sort of girl who orders a vodka and water at the bar to cut down on calories, or who drinks diet soda to justify the quarter pounder with cheese she just ate. My advice? Put in every ingredient she asks for and ignore the contradictions, because it's nine chances in ten she'll be ignoring them, too. Anyway, do n't sweat it. The universe has its own way of settling scores with people like that.\" \" What, like karma?\" \" You could call it that.\" About that time, an angry screech rang out just out front of the shop. The window decals are n't completely opaque, so I could see the liquid dripping down the poor girl's dress. It clung desperately to her body, the growing stain plain as day against the soft white fabric. Without warning, the cup had turned up and emptied all its contents the moment she went to take her first sip. I watched as she threw it to the ground, stomped on it as best she could in her high heels, then spun about, face red, her expression a mix of shock, embarrassment, confusion, and rage. She pulled on the door, but it did n't open. Of course it did n't. She tugged on it again and again, pounded on it for a few futile seconds, then she was gone. My customers let out a collective sigh of relief, and I smiled back at them. \" Half-off for everyone,\" I said. I patted the newbie on the back, then made for my office. \" Back to work, then. Good job so far today.\" I'll never be a superhero -- I wo n't be stopping bank robberies, going toe-to-toe with an arch-nemesis, or foiling cunning plots for world domination. I'll never have the fanatical admiration you see in the comic books, or receive keys to the city. I know that, and I've long since accepted it. But we all want to live in a better world, and you ca n't wait around on the big heroes to save you. The world's best improved when all us little people do our part to leave this rock a little better off than we found it. My small contribution today wo n't win me any prizes, but the measure of a man is what he does, not how many trophies he has. Sometimes, the small kindness of an ordinary man in a coffee shop is a grander deed even than all the legendary feats of the world's mightiest heroes.

It was n't something I'd ever eaten before, yet it was the most abundant of its kind. Like pork perhaps, a little, I was n't sure. The cheek they said, try the cheek. So I did. Killing was n't my thing, I had empathy, friends, I was even well liked. Killing was n't in my blood, but I had too. Needed to actually. So I killed him, Eric Tyler. Sexual predator, had a thing for young girls. Really young, children if you must know. I despise child molesters. Preying on the innocent, using it against them. He never saw it coming. I befriended him over time, took a while though. But eventually he came over for drinks. He spoke a lot, about this and that. I did n't like him, the talking was too much. As if he was trying to occupy himself, so he would n't obsess over innocent kids. The evening had progressed and Eric was quite intoxicated when I slit his throat. I came up behind him as I finished in the bathroom. He did n't see it coming, I felt sick to my stomach hearing him try to breathe. A few minutes in he dropped to his knees and drowned in his own blood. Must have been painful, I could see it in his eyes. Even felt a little bad for him, poor fuck. I only cut off the cheeks, I took both in case I burned one. For years I had waited for this moment. Years. Frying Eric's cheek felt strange, I even considered becoming vegetarian right there and then. But I did n't. I seasoned it abundantly, hoping it would mask the fact that it was human. It did n't. When I sat down to eat, I was grossly aware of the humanness. Gagging, I took a few bites. Then pushed away the plate. This was n't some Hannibal Lecter moment where I fafafafafa'd because it would bring comic relief. This was what I wanted. I sat at that table for hours staring at the half eaten cheek. Eric was rotting away in my bathroom, but soon none of it would matter. The wolf pelt I had taken from my grandmother lay thrown over the couch, waiting. Eventually I went to bed, just before the sun rose. Remorse creeping up my spine, licking at my conscience. I killed a man for my own selfish needs. Albeit a bad one, I had taken another life. Laying in bed I was wondering if I should've drank red or white with the meat. Which went with which, I could never remember.. An hour or two later I awoke feeling strangely well. I braided my long black hair and headed towards the lounge. The wolf pelt still lay there, waiting. Grabbing it I opened my front door and went out into the reservation. It was early still, with a chill in the air. I headed towards the forest and stopped short of the border heading into it. \" Here goes nothing.\" I whispered to myself, and wrapped the pelt around my shoulders. At first I felt nothing but then it was as if everything melted into me and out of me. I felt nauseous, dizzy, and scared. Then it stopped. Realizing I had closed my eyes, I slowly opened them. I was lower to the ground now, and my vision was different. I smelled everything, the trees, the fire burning up north in the reservation, even Eric's corpse. And I heard so much better, people talking in their homes, baby chicks chirping in a nest, and a grasshopper eating nearby. This was it, I had finally became what I was suppose to become, something so much more. My name is Hok'ee, the skinwalker. And this was destiny.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Choke-grips were loosened, fire axes were un-brandished, and every head in the room turned to see the intruder. A man with a bowler hat and briefcase stood in the doorway. He looked utterly ridiculous, like something from a 1950s Noire film. He did not seem to mind. \" Gentleman, I have the solution.\" The room stayed silent. \" This man is totally unpredictable? His thought patterns are impossible to discern; his typing errors erratic; his behaviour other-wordly.

Inside was a sheet of paper, a 3D picture that constantly shifted and moved as if it were trapped in the 2D plane of the paper. The man plunged his hand into the picture and it disappeared in a black mass of polygons and geometric wonders. A whimper was heard from the back of the boardroom. \" You want to improve your engine, gentlemen? You want to better understand human search patterns? This man is the exception.

Today, you've been assigned to teach them them how to use Internet. * * * The man stared at me incredulously, after getting his fill of the workstation in front of him, \" so one could say this is a fancy typewriter?\" I smiled, knowing that my switch from high-concept descriptions to simple analogies was finally reaching him. This man was no intellectual slouch, but being frozen for well over a century could have deleterious effects on a person, not least of which being the unfamiliarity of technology only dreamed about in his time. \" Yeah, that's as good an explanation as any,\" I replied with a pause, waiting to see what other connections he'd make with that thought. \" And this object, is a control mechanism?\" he said, holding the mouse, coming dangerously close to shining the laser in his eye. \" Yes, but leave it on the table, the light from underneath can blind you,\" I said, as courteous as I could. The look on his face was priceless, and a bit comical in a perverse way. It was as if he went from holding the keys to all knowledge to a venomous snake, as he gingerly set down the mouse and retracted his hand. He was silent for over a minute, and I did n't want to interrupt his train of thought. He had to make his own connections, I'm not sure if I could explain the basics any further. \" And I can use the typewriter and.. that thing, to effect change on this panel?\" he said, pointing at the monitor. \" Yes, exactly!\" \" I apologize for being dense, but I fail to see the merits of this,\" he said, rubbing his forehead, \" perhaps I'm not asking the right questions.\" \" I'll answer anything, but I ca n't promise you'll understand it, first time around.\" He grimaced, \" yes, I still have a bit of getting used to, to do, with your terminology. Slang, correct?\" \" Yes.\" \" Clever turns of phrases, transient connections between ideas shaped by current events and popularity.\" \" Sir, you explain that better than anyone in our time,\" I laughed. He smiled, which was a good thing. He'd best understand this next bit, if he was comfortable and open to yet another new experience. \" I still fail to see the utility in this, from what little I have seen of this machine, I ca n't understand its importance. Or, why I'm sat in front of it now, instead of my normal course of studies.\" \" Okay,\" I said, winding up to throw him a fastball, \" this machine can access something called the internet, where you can communicate with any other human on the planet who has one of these, in real time.\" He was silent, lips pursed into a thin slit, but eyes wide, taking in the desktop pattern, a simple fractal. It was my favorite picture from the standard set shipped with the operating system, though I wondered now if it was more of an interference at this phase of his education. \" Which explains the typewriter, I think I may be grasping this a bit more, it's all too fantastic to process, and in a lot of ways I'm taking your word at face value, young man. You do n't seem like the type that would deceive.\" I smiled, \" actually I'm glad you mentioned that. Due to the fact that you can communicate with anyone at any time, and each individual has their own reasons and motives for using the internet, it becomes the sum of all things, to all people.\" He looked at me, perhaps puzzled, or maybe intrigued. \" The internet is the sum of all truth, and the sum of all lies. The sum of our hopes, and the sum of our fears. On this machine you can find places where the latest discoveries are being discussed. And with a few clicks, you can find places that will ridicule you mercilessly, or worse.\" He looked as if he was readying a reply, but stopped. He stroked his chin, \" in my day, New York had just supplanted London as the figurative center of the world, a place where you could publish earth-shaking theories, and get mugged on the same block.\" I had to laugh, I had n't made that connection, maybe some things never change, \" that's a good analogy, though you might want to consider this place as its own world, at least until you're more familiar.\" He shot me a glance, \" I can assure you, I do not want to become familiar with a machine. That is, unless the, umm, slang is n't the same.\" I was n't sure what he meant, and I was pressed on time, \" I'm not sure if I can explain any more of the basics. Our engineers have created automated lessons called tutorials, which will walk you through the process of using the computer to its fullest potential. I will be back in a few hours to check on your progress, and there may be others that check in periodically as well,\" I said quickly, and extended my hand for him to shake, which he did, \" I wish you the best of luck, and remember you can learn at your own pace.\" * * * I returned several hours later, after giving my presentation on the 200-year-old man, and how his case held promise for all mankind. I heard him giggle as I opened the door. I could see the vaguely feral look in his eyes that came from excessive usage, \" come here! I understand now!\" I smiled, \" excellent, describe it in your own words.\" \" I've never seen so much nudity, that was a bit taboo in my day. Why did n't you say the internet was a study of the human form?\" I sighed, \" yes, that's one part of the internet, there's more-\" \" Yes!

They said that they created us in pairs. By they I mean the Reproduction and Evolution of Genes Society. We learn in history that a long time ago we were able to reproduce without the aid of REGS, but after what was once a revolutionary contraceptive turned into a disease, it turned a woman's womb sterile ever since, the only way to reproduce was out of the womb of a woman. After a few generations, REGS discovered a way to manipulate the genes to produce perfect humans, right down to their brain chemistry. You see, love is just the chemicals and hormones in your brain triggering certain responses to what would be a good mate. But we no longer need to look for a good mate. One was already made for us, and REGS made sure that we would know we would be a good match by numbering us. There's an old quote I remember from school, that the eyes used to be considered'windows to the soul.'It seems fitting that to find your partner you have to look into their eyes, a romantic notion of REGS, I suppose. Another one is'ladies first,'which is how I know my mate will be 22 born on the 3rd day of February since I'm number 21. They create 100 babies a day in their perfect way, following blueprints that are made generations in advance. Is n't it lovely to know that REGS has already thought of my future children and grandchildren, too? To make sure we do n't get distracted during our learning years, they separate us from birth, distributing us as babies to our parents. REGS carefully planned our schooling for us, making sure we do n't accidentally run into our life mates too soon. My parent and teachers tell me that as soon as you see your mate, the chemicals in your brain align and you just know, you're in love. But you have to be close enough to make eye contact, my mom warned. That way you can smell each other, which is the fastest way for our pheromones to reach our brain. I'm so excited to meet him. Today is my birthday. His, too, I guess. We turn 21 today. \" Are you ready? \" My best friend, Amber, asked. She was standing beside me, both of us wearing white gowns. She's number 23. Today is our wedding day, the day I get to meet my mate, number 22, for the first time. I'm going to be feeling so many new emotions today. Love, attraction, and lust. \" Yes. \" I reply. \" I was born ready. \" I smiled. All of the girls I had grown up with were all in the same room, lines in numerical order. I was in the second row, behind Stacy, who is 1. We all wore plain white gowns and were giddy with excitement as we waited. The doors to the meeting room opened. Erin, number 19, let out a squeak of nervousness beside me. I squeezed her and Amber's hand as we proceeded out, five by five. Across from us, the men were already waiting, all wearing black tuxedos. Stacy, in front of me, rushed to the first man on the left, eager to smell him and fall in love. I watched as they crashed into each other, and the man held her close, staring into each other's eyes. A moment later, Rachael, number 3, did the same with her mate. Soon, 1 through 9 were in love, crying and kissing. Counting quickly ahead, I found him, my mate, number 22. I rushed to him, dodging the other girls doing the same. But before I could reach him, Amber was there first. Amber fell into number 22's arms, and they made eye contact and breathed deeply. I stood there, dumbfounded. 24, the man next to 22 looked at me, like I was supposed to be his. But I wasn't. I rushed to Amber, and tried to nudge her to her man. But she wouldn't budge, Amber and 22 were lost in each other, smiling and in their own little world. Angrily, I huffed through my nose. Then everything changed. I felt a surge of warmth fill my chest, a reaction in my abdomen, and a completely new experience fill my brain. Love. This is love. I would do anything for this man. This man who was still holding Amber, who still looked exactly as I felt staring into his eyes. New emotions surged. Jealously. He was *mine. * \" Get off him! \" I yelled, finally tearing her off of 22 and shoving her into 24, who looked lost. 24 caught Amber and held her close. Amber looked about to cry, 24, I could see, finally fell in love, tenderly holding Amber like she was the most precious thing. 22 looked at me, I smiled at him. \" What are you doing!? \" He yelled, anger lining his face. My smile dropped. \" She's *mine. * \" He growled. \" No, *I'm* number 21, *she's* 23! \" I told him. \" *I'm* yours. \" I insisted, trying to touch him, but he shoved my hands away. \" I'm so confused. \" Said both Amber and 24, together, as they watched us. 22 noticed how 24 was holding Amber, and rushed to him. \" Get your hands off her, Jared! \" He yelled, forcefully wrapping an arm around Amber's waist and hauling her out of 24, Jared's, grasp. \" Shane! \" Jared yelled back, \" There's been a mix-up. She's supposed to be with me and *she* \" He pointed to me, \" is supposed to be with you. \" Everyone was confused, and happy couples around us were ignorant to the turmoil a few feet from them.

My heart ached as I saw Shane try and stay with Amber, resisting the doctor. My doctor began walking out, turning me away forcefully. I struggled with the arm holding mine. \" Where are you taking him? \" I demanded. \" Where are you taking Shane? \" Amber soon was right beside me, crying as she forlornly looked at Shane as well, who was going in an opposite direction with a bewildered Jared beside him, forlornly looking at Amber.

{"input": "Tropeday # 4: The Hopeless War ( Contest )", "output": "The war began the year I turned eight. It was n't the first war our race endured against one another but it was the most apocalyptic. One hundred years from the start of the \" War-to-end-all-wars\", seventy-five years from the Second World War, humankind were culled again. Had we forgotten? As our grandparents died off and grainy images, divorced of colour muted our morality; it would seem so. We did n't destroy most of the world's population quickly though, that was one legacy of the last world war. No, we were lingering, no nuclear desecration, no head of a national government wanted to be the first person to press the red buttons. So we slowly began, a former Super-power invaded or rescued a smaller neighbouring territory, a sub continent erupted in civil war and the people starved. Some South American country harboured a fugitive, a Mediterranean country went broke. Many little events culminated to our destruction, there was no solitary climax. By the time I was twelve I was used to the hunger pains gnawing the pit of my stomach. Rationing had sorted the childhood obesity epidemic, chocolate was a luxury and my peers and I were dab hands at crafting munitions. Initially written off as a religious fanatic, the \" Prophet\" came to the world's centre stage when I was fourteen, his Darwinist ideology appealed to the hungry populace and the city-states were formed on the purging of the weak. Paris, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Johannesburg, Vancouver and Sydney, the cities that ruled the world. Countries fell, continents succumbed but these power bases spread their tentacles. Subscribers to the new religion were the leaders of the Six Cities, under their authority the death camps began. The logic was simplistic, too many humans, too few resources, too many different moralities, too many conflicts. End the lives of seven billion and preserve humanity. Whole towns and cities were systematically slaughtered leaving only a handful from each region, the survivors would become known as \" The Grief-Spawn\". They were the thinkers, the strong, healthy, the intelligent, the logical and they were united in their grief. A single adult male born on the outskirts of London has nothing in common with an adolescent female born in the farmlands of what was once Nebraska. They have no family, friends, even strangers who passed them on the street are n't alive any more. They are unique until they meet each other. Their common enemy will be war and the consequences of war. They will raise children together, healthy and strong children who will be instilled with the knowledge that complete decimation of society is the consequence of war. Their children will never know food hunger because there is no longer a shortage of food and this social utopia will last for maybe a generation or two and then someone will pick a fight over a patch of earth with a view of Sydney Harbour. On my twentieth birthday I was fighting in the Resistance, word had filtered back to the common man about the mass genocides of humankind and small cells did terror campaigns on the Six Cities, I was a foot soldier from Dublin originally and my unit was targeting Paris when we were caught. I was young, healthy, a seasoned soldier and I had shown an aptitude for survival; the fact that I was n't a believer in the Survival of the Fittest Regimes ideology was irrelevant. I was innovative and a problem solver and I had the mentality to survive in the New World. I became one of thirty two Grief-Spawn from the island of Ireland. I am twenty-four now, I ended up going to New York like the potato famine immigrants before me, I sit at night in a large home and during the day work on a farm, all food feeds all the community, there are too few humans left. The Resistance failed. Every day I contemplate being one less human on Earth, every person I knew for the first two decades of my life are dead now. Work. Toil. Eat. Sleep. Die? Tonight was going to be no different to any other night I had thought, I would see if I had the courage to kill myself and stop the torturous survivor guilt. We had been assigned a work detail to one of the towns outside old Montreal and myself and three others departed before the sun rose and drove six hours to demolish the last memories of some dead Quebecois. I had seen the lamp in an abandoned furniture store, well of course it was abandoned, everywhere is abandoned when almost everyone is dead. I plugged it in and switched it on as soon as I made it through my front door, it made me smile, the shapely woman's leg clothed in fishnet stockings under a frilled lamp shade. It was kitsch and amusing but I had liberated it from the store because it reminded me of my sister, she had had a miniature Leg Lamp in her bedroom, next to a minuscule, wire dress maker's dummy to hang jewelry from. Katie had loved things like that and for the first time in for years I did n't feel so alone in the world.

This great race to the stars spurned on by practical space propulsion technology invented almost by accident.

By 2025 hundreds of corporate entities were shooting things into space. The drives could achieve relativistic speeds, or create massive warp bubbles and move starships faster than light. It was like the pioneer days all over again. But I digress, this is n't a history lesson, exactly. It's important to understand where we, humans, came from, to understand why the Fermi barrier. Life is rare. And most of the time, it never makes it past the most early stages. We've only encountered eleven megaflora, two megafauna. nothing like earthly organisms or biodiversity. Nothing with complicated nervous systems. We were alone in the galaxy. So we spread out. Like a shark, we would grow as fast as our resources and space allowed. By 2050 there were 44 billion humans in the galaxy. Seems paltry compared to the two trillion I was born into. We did something else too: We created life. We seeded hundreds of worlds that had all the best conditions with organisms modified from our own DNA. And we just.. we just walked away. Because we could. You would have though religions, the beliefs that people had in supernatural forces or creators, would flourish in the absence of any other life, but it was some how swallowed up by a bigger truth. We we're the creators now. We were the custodians of creation. We were the universe experiencing itself subjectively. I remember when the eidolons, a sect of human immortals, launched themselves into the intergalactic void on their ten thousand year voyage, their spokeswoman told me \" The children of our creations will one day look to the sky, as we did, and then will ask'why'and they will ask'for what purpose'. What answer will you have?\" Strangely prophetic huh little guy? I do n't know if she knew I'd make it here, or that you would. But here we are. I do n't think any humans are lift. I do n't know if I count, any more. I know that beyond the womb of stars, in the sea of time, there are those who went searching after eternity. That makes all this yours. Hundreds of worlds teeming with your distant cousins. Mysteries both great and terrible lurk in the void. Ancient ships and ruins of a civilization the crossed the whole galaxy. I think that's why we did it. For you. Our creations. Our children. We did it so you wo n't be alone. We did it to give you something to find. To explore, to learn and grow and be more than we ever were.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "The devil mixed up your paperwork and gave you someone else's personal hell, which to you, is heaven.", "output": "I awoke to silence. My eyes, still foggy from what felt like years of slumber, slowly adjusted to the dim light of the area around me. I was in a small rectangular room. At first glance, it looked like one of those solitary confinement rooms. The four walls were blank, and the floor was blank. There was no sign of a door anywhere. There was light coming from the ceiling; there appeared to be ceiling tiles, and some of them were lit. The lights were in a square pattern, but only three of them were illuminated; there was a darkened tile where one of the corners should've been. The walls and floor were both concrete. The air felt a little heavy, as if the room was underground, but it also felt somewhat warm. In breathed in and out. \" Ahhh...\" My breath ended the silence and echoed briefly. I looked around more carefully, to make sure there was no one else here. Nope; nothing but smoothly laid-out concrete. Actually, there was a sign with some writing on the wall to the left of me. I walked over. My footsteps knocked loudly off of the walls. I paused for a moment and realized I was still in ordinary clothes; I was wearing a black t-shirt with a video game print on it, jeans, and the shoes I normally wear to work. This was all pretty regular attire for me. Strangely, I did n't remember putting any of them on though. I turned and faced the sign on the wall. \" GreenPencil's Personal Hell,\" it read. Suddenly I froze. What were the implications of this message? Was this real? Or was this some kind of dumb joke? I did n't know anyone who might've played a joke on me like this... I did n't have many friends. And even if I did, what kind of person would do something so weird to their friend? I tried desperately to remember how I'd gotten here. Nothing came to mind. \" Dammit,\" I whispered. There was no door here, and this room was tightly sealed. Was this message true then? Was this... hell? Did I die?! I did n't spend time thinking about my apparent death though; I returned to the fact that this was hell, somehow. I looked around for some source of danger. Was there some kind of trap about to go off? It felt warm in here; was the room temperature going up? Was toxic gas filling the room? But nothing seemed off. The room was silent and completely still. But then another thought popped into my head. There... is oxygen coming in here, right?! But if this really was hell, did I need oxygen? Was I still bound by human limitations in the afterlife? There did n't appear to be any way for food or water to come in or out of here, so I had to assume not. But if I was, I guess it would n't take long to find out... \" Well I guess it's true then,\" I spoke quietly to myself. \" But if so, then what the hell? It's just an empty room.\" It's very calm here. Sure, it's not a very lavish arrangement, but some peace and solitude is actually quite nice. I took another glance at the sign. \" GreenPencil's Personal Hell,\" huh? That's really weird... and then I laughed to myself. \" Wait, there's no underscore in that name! Wow, that must be it! My real name has an underscore.\" I laughed again. \" Wow, someone fucked up I guess.\" I imagined some demon somewhere was getting chewed out by Satan for messing up something so simple. I mean, this had to be a mistake. \" It's quiet here! I do n't hate being alone at all.\" I decided to speak louder. I assumed no one was around to hear me, after all. \" This is actually perfectly ideal for me. My personal hell would probably be the exact opposite of this! It'd probably be a room full of people... people that I hate.\" I continued to entertain this disgusting idea. \" They'd probably be trying to talk to me!\" I chuckled. \" And I'd probably be under... some kind of curse that made it so everything I say is stupid or embarrassing or something. Maybe these people would be asking me questions that I do n't want to answer. And they wo n't leave me alone, either!\" The deeper I dug into this fantasy, the more I laughed at myself. It was true: I really hated talking to people. I was stressed out over having to carry out any conversation. My job in real life as a cashier required me to be sociable. I had always hoped I would be placed in a career where I did n't have to talk or interact with anyone. The fact that there was no pressure here for that was actually a huge relief! \" This is literally my personal heaven! Nice one Satan, you moron.\" I sat down on the floor facing the sign and joyfully went back to the idea of a demon being punished for putting me here on accident. How do demons even get punished? Does Satan conjure up a personal hell for them? What would a demon's personal hell be like? And as I laid back on the concrete floor, staring up at the ceiling, I thought about the actual GreenPencil. He must've been mistakenly placed in my personal hell. How was he reacting? He must be really enjoying it, if his personal hell is the empty room I'm in. \" I bet he's having some great conversations with all of the people I hate! Man, he must be overjoyed. We really lucked out!\" As I thought more and more about how funny this situation was, I kept giggling to myself. ( end of part 1, continued in the next comment )", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He slid the paper back into his pocket with trembling hands as tears blurred his vison. \" Today is Marissa's birthday\" he thought aloud while fumbling his wedding ring. Their daughter had been part of a psychotic murder rampage 3 years before and his wife could n't take it; he found her, body hunched forward in the bathtub the blood coagulating where she had taken the bread knife to her neck.

It felt nice, he leaned in to her embrace. She smiled at him but he did n't smile back, he just reached behind him and found the bread knife that was stashed under his bag.

{"input": "If you're in a world where physical health problems were treated like mental health problems", "output": "Gym class. I hated it ever since I'd started school. Every single day we were trudged out and made to stand in line while the teacher marched up and down and shouted at us like a drill sergeant. And every single day, he'd get to me, stop, and scream all kinds of disparaging things in my face while every muscle in my body was strained against my desire to push him away. Personal fucking space, dude. I'd appreciate it if you understood the concept. Some days it was a new tirade, others it was the same old shit. I'd gone to the principal, the dean of students, and the school nurse to see if they could do anything about it. But the answer was always the same. No. See, if I had a normal illness—if I was schizophrenic, say, or had OCD—the gym teacher would be out on his ass before he could blink for harassing a student. But mine was physical, invisible. There was nothing anyone could do. I heard his footsteps come closer, and closer still. My gaze was fixed on the floor as I saw a pair of running shoes stop in front of me. We'd run the pacer yesterday. The tendons in my ankle had strained when I pushed against them at the marker, the resulting pain causing me to hop for a few steps before falling flat on my face on the polished wood floor. No doubt it would be the subject of today's lecture. \" Mr. Coleman, \" he growled, yanking my chin up so that my eyes met his. \" You look at me when I'm talking to you! \" \" Yes, sir. \" He sighed. \" Is it going to be the same thing every day with you, Coleman? How many times to I have to tell you? Straighten your arm out! \" \" I can't, sir. \" I told him this every time. Apparently, though, that answer wouldn't suffice anymore. Before I could move, he gave a savage yank to my right forearm that was crossed stiffly over my abdomen, bracing one hand above my elbow and one below and pulling, the resulting sickening crack echoing through the gym. I tried to keep a straight face, though I was breaking out in a cold sweat from the pain. I hope I didn't pass out. No doubt I'd be in for worse pain if I did. \" Now the hand. \" he grumbled, and proceeded to pry my fingers apart from their perpetual fist. They only sprang back into place the minute he let go. I had no control over it. If only I hadn't had that stroke, I'd be completely normal. \" Sir… \" \" Shut up! I'm tired of listening to your bullshit excuses! Leg! \" He gripped my right leg the same as he had my arm, above and below the knee, and pulled. Another echoing crack, and I fell to the floor as he finally backed away. \" Carson, Deitmer, pick him up. \" He barked, as my companions pulled me roughly to my feet. My knee was almost certainly sprained, if not broken, and it buckled immediately. I leaned on my good leg and prayed I wouldn't topple over. \" Today, we're going to be climbing the rock wall, and Coleman here is going to demonstrate how to do it. I hobbled over slowly, steadily, sweat dripping down my temples as my vision tunneled. The teacher swooped forward, grabbing me by the wrists, and dragging me towards the giant fiberglass torture device. \" If you fall off, you're done at this school. \" he growled in my ear. \" Now! \" he barked, addressing the class. \" One hand here! One hand there! And climb! \" He roared, slapping my hands against the footholds and clamping them down. \" Oh, for God's sake, your foot, Coleman! \" he wrenched my still-aching foot, wrapped in an Ace bandage, onto a hold. \" Climb! \" I did as I was told, my vision growing fuzzier and fuzzier as I ascended, my palms slipping and sliding from their precarious grip. Didn't climbers usually have chalk for this? I guess I wasn't considered human enough for basic safety precautions. It would explain the lack of a harness, too. \" Hurry up! \" The command was enough to startle me and make me lose my grip, plummeting to the floor with a thud as everything went black. When I woke up, I was strapped by the wrists and ankles to a gurney, a scratchy hospital gown draped over me. I tried to move, but it hurt so much. And no wonder. My elbow and knee were swollen to twice their normal size, and had turned a sickening reddish-purple. There was a lump on my head where it had made contact with the floor. \" Nurse! \" I called. \" Help! \" After a few moments, a disgruntled nurse in blue scrubs got up from the nurses'station and meandered over. \" What is it? \" she asked tersely. \" What happened? Why am I here? \" \" You had a seizure in your gym class. You were endangering others, so we had to bring you in. Do you understand? \" She spoke slowly, as if I were a toddler. \" Yes, but…I don't see how I could be dangerous if I was unconscious. \" \" I don't make the rules, \" she said, snapping on a glove. She handed me a small plastic cup with a pill in it, and another of water. \" Swallow, \" she commanded. After I did, she swiped her gloved finger around my mouth to make sure I'd actually swallowed it. \" Can I get some ice? \" I asked. \" For… \" \" What's ice going to do? \" she scoffed as she walked away. As the sedative kicked in and I fell back in exhaustion, I prayed for another aneurism to come and finish me off. I couldn't live like this anymore.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

The recording reminded him it has been exactly four years, three months, and two days since his last dream, which he finished reviewing for the three hundred and sixty third time. He waved his left hand up to remove the holoscope. The screen dissolved in front of his eyes and he was left alone, glancing out over the bright lights of New Brisbane. He stopped to admire it, only for a moment before he felt the dull fog descending over him, a heaviness of the eyelids and a sensation of falling. Then the familiar, painless pinch at the base of his neck and then the dull rust taste formed at the back of his throat. Yan stayed awake. Nulla-Somnum, or Null-um for short is considered to be the crowning achievement in implant pharmaceuticals, humanities dominance over his own nature.

Yan was acutely aware of the terrorist groups that formed out of these factions, people gave their lives and took the lives of others, all to dream regularly. Yan had remembered hating them, that was until he met Melissa. Melissa had been a doctor, of sorts. Her profession had just become fully automated although she insisted on being needed for a few days a week to check on patients and make sure vital steps were n't overlooked by the aggressively efficient hospital AI. She used to speak about the pro-sleep groups with such a fond nostalgia, Yan had felt like a fool when she disappeared that morning. He did n't need to read the message, and could n't bring himself to open the last gift she had left for him. He knew where she had gone. It was n't a shock for him when she was captured a few months afterwards. Appearing worldwide before an international court guilty of crimes against the global state. The punishment was as draconian as it was ironic. Sentenced to permanent coma, a lifetime of sleep. Yan had watched and he knew he missed her, and knew he should be agonising over loosing her, but all he could feel was the painless pinch at the back of his neck and the soothing neutral sensation washing over him. He had decided at the time to fight for her, to mount a legal battle or contact some of her old comrades in the cause who had managed to escape. After a time however, his searches had proven useless and all trace of her had dissolved in the holoscope, which updated and edited humanities history as it saw best before downloading it directly into his conciseness. It had been nearly a year when he looked at the note and the gift again. \" Eat Me\", an obscure reference to an ancient text. Yan couldnt find anything more on the meaning behind it, and inside a box he removed a smaller box made of an odd material. In big letters on the front it had the words Nytol. That night he had taken one of the strange pills. The night he made the recording. The screen appeared above Yan's face and he pressed play one last time. Melissa standing on the shore, the stars reflecting on the gently cresting waves. She takes his hand as they look out at the ocean, she smiles and dives in. Yan follows, they swim out into the black sea and they embrace. As they do Yan begins to sink. down and down. Melissa smiles, as the Sun rises and shines behind her, as he sinks down and down into the crystal water.

I was stuck alone with my thoughts and nothing else. No action, no breathing, no heartbeat. I was dead but I hadn't left, I was still here and had no off switch. I was a consciousness with no way to communicate, interact with or control the environment in which I existed. And I couldn't stop being me. This was death. Is this is what everyone who has passed on is experiencing? No Heaven, no Hell just existence? Does everyone just get reduced to a soul? I came to realize I had reached the end but only the end of my physical existence not the end of my mental existence. When would I reach the end of that? What would make it happen? Would I have to wait until my brain disintegrated? What am I and why can I think? I realized that the answer is probably nothing. I wasn't running on the power of my body anymore so I didn't need that to continue to exist. This was my existence from now until, forever. I heard a car door slam in the distance and footsteps approaching me. Someone was coming to the track to run. I heard the footsteps pause and then increase tempo and loudness as they got nearer. \" Hey, are you OK? \". No! No I'm not! I'm dead you idiot, kill me! I'm supposed to be gone! I heard him poke my shoulder and slap my face. I'm guessing that slap must have felt cold because he stopped talking and made a call to 911. A few minutes later I heard the sirens and more people running to me. There were people beating on what sounded like a ham, I guessed that was my chest, yelling \" there's no heartbeat \". I really was dead not that I needed anyone to confirm it. \" Clear! \", a few seconds, \" Clear! \", a few seconds, \" Clear! \", OW!!!! I felt that! Holy crap! I'm feeling something! \" He has a faint heartbeat! \". I concentrated on opening my eyelids and was able to open my left eyelid slightly, I could only see blurry light. From there they put me on a cart and rushed me off to the hospital. I didn't regain consciousness for 3 weeks. When I did I found out about the tumor and told how lucky I was that someone had found me at the track in time to save my life. They confirmed that when they found me I was clinically dead and how they were lucky to bring me back, my body temperature had dropped very low in short time I had been out. No one would listen to me when I told them that because they found me at 6:30 in the morning I had been dead for eight and a half hours. Since that was medically impossible it must have been something that I was misremembering because of my experience. My running watch told me the exact time I had collapsed though. I had experienced death and now I know what what's waiting for me and everyone else.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I approached with the intent of buying her a beer and she gave me a smile, her emerald-colored eyes meeting mine. God, her skin smelt great. When she asked me what I was doing in a dive bar like this, in the middle of god-knows-where Texas, I gave her a smirk and suggested I was just on the prowl for interesting conversation. She raised her glass. After a few beers, I offered to take her to her car. After some reluctance, she took my arm and my night had begun. It was all to be easy, make her believe all was going to be well and I'd drive her home. She was so beautiful, so sickly sweet with her clear complexion and taut tendons in her hands. I thought about what I could do with her. There were others like her in the past, but she captured my imagination unlike how the others did. It's hard to explain, but it drove me nuts. There was something inside of her I had to have. I needed her. When we got into her car with me behind the driver's seat, she gave me clear directions and I figured I'd follow them on a whim. There was n't much either of us could do to control the way this path was taking us, with dark forests on both sides of the moon-lit road. After an hour of driving, we went off of the road into a dirt side road. We'd get out of the car and that's when I removed the knife from my jacket. It was a KA-BAR, the kind that the United States Marine corps use. I suggested that she not bother running. There was no sense to it, I was going to devour her soul as I'd done to countless men and women. I will become a God, I explained- when I saw her hands were no longer human. They were about a foot long, with sizable claws on the ends of her fingers. I took a hard swallow and thought that it was my mind playing tricks on me as it was oft to do. When I jammed the knife into her gut, she tore a good chunk of the side of my face off and made a noise I ca n't explain. It sounded like the legions of hell roaring out of the gates of perdition. I stumbled back to the ground and tried to scramble away. The knife was lodged into her small intestine, but I do n't think she noticed. Her eyes were black as the night, and I could see her torso expanding and stretching. Bones stretched and snapped out of place and I could n't understand. When her jaw dislocated and stretched out, revealing a row of fangs, I took it as a sign to run. I ran away from the car into the woods, that voice screaming and barking like a raving dog behind me near the Escalade. I ran until I exhausted myself, with nothing but forest for miles around. My heart was racing. I was excited, I was horrified, I was in agonizing pain and I could n't understand what was going on. My face began to slough off, with bits of meat and tissue of my cheek hanging limply with what was left of my ear. I was in so much pain that I fell over, hands desperately pressing the shredded skin back to where it belonged. I tree branches snap from multiple directions. It hurt too much to move. I rolled onto my side and tried to crawl away from the noise, my arms protecting my head once I realized this was a fool's errand. I felt a massive hand grip a vise around my ankle and I was soon dragged away into the darkness of the forest. When I came to, claws were digging at my jacket and into my shirt. There were three of them, tall with long, thin arms, all of them covered with dark brown fur and wolflike heads attached to nearly neckless shoulders. I screamed and screamed when those claws found their way into my stomach. I saw my legs get torn away from my body and fought for like stray dogs bickering over a treat. The world went black, and I saw the face of true God. He had a wolf's head.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

{"input": "Stairway to Heaven", "output": "At some point in a man's life, he comes across the Stairway to Heaven on the sidewalk. It is just a bunch of ordinary stony steps, really. Grass on the sides, green and lush, sways slightly under his footsteps. Walls of cement and rocks sit on top of the stairs, staring calmly into the far beyond. White clouds are idling in the blue sky which is surrounded by tall trees. The missing handrails on the left hand side may be the most unusual thing about it. He looks up, but does n't know why. As he turns his eyes, he realizes that he is in fact, not looking up, but down, into a flight of stairs that leads to a river-side path. The sky he thinks he saw, is only its reflection in the rippling waters. *Ah, * he says to himself. *It's just my mind playing tricks with me, there's nothing special. * So he decides to stay no more, and intends to leave. Now the strangest thing happens. He thinks he was standing on the sidewalk, looking down at the river; as he takes the first step forward, he stumbles and nearly falls in astonishment. For his feet are firmly planted on a wooden fence perpendicular to the previously mentioned sidewalk he has been walking on. Now, the stairway is indeed leading up towards Heaven, and gravity weighs on him as if nothing has changed. It seems that he has lost the perception of up-and-down. Now he has become quite confused. It could be that he has been walking on some wooden pathway for a while, next to a short wall, along the river bank. He picks up a stone and drops it into the river, but the stone keeps falling. He never hears a \" plop\", or observes the ripples on the surface. So he shuffles closer to the stairs, dreading every squeak of the wood. He starts climbing the stairs, and stops after a couple steps. He sees the wall of water rising high above his head, threatening his life with all its destructive mass and force. He closes his eyes in despair, waiting for the weight of the world to carry him away into the void behind him. Yet nothing happens, he opens his eyes again and the awful reflection of the sky stands firmly still. What else is there to do? He can not possibly go back to the wooden fences hanging by a thread above the abyss, but moving onward into the curtain of water will surely be no better? He will drown, or hit the other side of the bank. Or will he? He looks up again and the body of water he always believed to be a river is not a river after all -it's an ocean. The reflection of the trees on the other side? Reefs and seaweeds and driftwood. He carefully climbs to the top and touches the surface. He feels the water pushing his hand upward with the gentle force of buoyance. He immediately draws his hand back, watching in wonder as the water drips back into the ocean instead of dripping down onto the steps. He walks back down to the wooden path, pokes his head out, and sees nothing but emptiness and a cliff of objects he can not recognize anymore. Then, with one last glance at the world he once knew, he dashes up the stairway and plunges into the vast, unknown waters.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Its amusing the musings of a sage from a land I never went to happens to be among my last thoughts. Does my impeccable integrity even matter any more? Should it? I am laying here, knifed in the dark, dying. It would be an acceptable death had it been by a great monster. Or the Undead God of the Blasted Ninth Hell. But, no, it was n't. I was knifed by a kobold. The fodder of first level adventurers, I, in my greatest, was stabbed by a kobold in the dark because I was simply too cocky. Even when the kobold stabbed me, I shrugged it off: I was a crazy high adventurer, no mere dog face was going to take me out! I dispatched the little beast in seconds. However, being the manly man I am, I did n't bother to heal just then. I waited: after all, why waste a potion then? Or a spell by a cleric? It was a scratch, really. I did n't realize it was a cursed blade. Little damage and could have been easily healed, but if it was n't healed within an hour, then it became incurable. And then progressed to the inevitable death of whomever, whatever, was stabbed or even scratched by the blade. I did n't find the rest of my party for a couple hours and no monsters were successful in even sneezing on me, never mind actually harming me. So, no potions. No healing. And now... I am dying, mere moments away from dying. I have to wonder. There was an oracle, so long ago. She said I was going to do great things and radically change the world. I do n't seem to have done so. Does that mean the Oracle was wrong? Or did she just tell me that so I'd leave? Or so I would give some portion of my treasure trove for her temple? I'm lying here dying from a kobold knifing and I bitterly snort. Its a dark and lonely place. The rest of the party is occupied with the boss of the dungeon, but did n't want me to come to do a great self sacrifice, an appropriate ending: the boss raises anyone or anything killed near it as extremely powerful undead. Even more dangerous than the boss itself. So, no noble sacrifice for me. I grow more bitter. No great death. No great purpose. Just an ignominious fate, to be forgotten, to die alone and probably even have my corpse looted: I had my doubts my party members would have any chance of taking out that boss. So my partymates left me to die and they were probably going to be reanimated as powerful undead. Awesome. Not. I feel death ebbing in at the edges of my vision. I feel my demise as it approaches. It was only moments away. I would die. Alone. Bitterness overwhelms me. There is not waxing philosophical. There is only the knowledge I have amounted to... nothing. I have influenced nothing. I have stopped nothing. I have done nothing that someone else could have, would have done. I was immensely replaceable. In that moment, feeling death's hand on my shoulder I remember I have a bauble. One that is imbued with mana, vast amounts of mana. No one could use it unless they felt Death's touch. I'd saved it for something excited. My demise. But I had put that from my mind since I had not planned on dying any time soon. I hate the world in my last moment. I hate everything and everyone. Good. Bad. Everyone. Death touches me. And I spiritually reach for the bauble. And I curse the world. I curse everyone and everything. There would be no more magic, I cursed. I died. And with my death, the world changed.

Unempathetic is better description but unfortunately it is n't a word. Anyway these scientist discovered the Earth needed oil to live, hence Life Blood. It very literally kept the planet alive and we were sucking it dry, like billions of tiny mosquitoes. So these same scientists began developing a'cure,'SynOil they called it. Not terribly creative I know but give them some credit, they are scientists after all. When they started pumping SynOil back into the Earth it worked! A marvellous success, a real crowning achievement of humanity. Forest came back into bloom, rainforests repaired themselves in mere weeks, new species were found every day, rivers flowed cleaner and faster in hours... and then. SynOil started working too well. Imagine stem cells on steroids and this is what began happening to Earth. It literally expanded. It began growing and growing and everything on the surface followed suit. Entire cities were reclaimed by nature in days, mammals began to increase in size, extinct animals coming back to life... everything except us.

It had been 5 days since she last saw them last. She wished she had rationed her food better, but they had never been gone this long before. She gripped her necklace. An heirloom her grandmother had given her from years past. She was 6 when she had died. Her grandmother was one of the last people who had seen the glory days. > Aoife, hunny, the days of old were beautiful. My mother, your great grandmother was Queen of our kingdom. We had built magnificent buildings in her name. Palaces that would rise to the sky made of stone. Our magicians were knowledgable with lore that would make the earth tremble. We understood everything of the world. But our knowledge was our undoing. When the family of roses came, we were thrown in a fight we did not want. They were vicious, and we in part fought back with equivalent ferocity. We had our knowledge, but their numbers were simply too great. In the end, the elders of Eire fought to their last breath. The magicians summoned the Earth, the Evil of the roses were vanquished. > They had sent me away to take care of the children. They blindfolded us, and lead us elsewhere. Told me to lead our people to safety. They placed us in a cave, and closed the entrance, and told us to go. Halfway through our travels we heard screams, shakes, and at times we thought the cave would collapse upon us. At last we found the exit. We exited and found scorched earth. But we were alone. We could not see our home. I would never see my parents again. > One year after, a man approached our village. A poor bedraggled man. We were vary of Roses seeking us out. Our boys jumped on him and dragged him to me. He was the last adult of Eire. He was a servant of my mothers, who was sent with a gift to give to me. A necklace with three entwined circles and a blue sapphire in it. He told me it was a key before he passed away. I never knew what it was a key of. I could remember her words as if they were yesterday. I remember begging her to tell me where the cave. But the fear in her eyes. I think it was the memories of her parents more than the thoughts of the Roses. Aoife thought back to her grandmother's last day. > Aoife, pet, take this necklace. Hold it dear. Perhaps one day you can return. She was shunned off towards the exit as her grandmother dealt with matters of the village before her end. Aoife left her tent. It was a sunny day, but there was no happiness in her. They would have to scavenge in the ground for food. Eoin, her little brother, ran up to her and started teasing her. She managed to push him away, and continued to look for food. She would have to provide for herself and Eoin by nightfall. She digged, and searched, but to no avail. As she took her break as the sun reached its zenith, she realized she could n't hear Eoin. She looked around desperately, and saw a faint dot on the horizon, and began to run towards it. As she did, she gripped at her neck, and realized that her necklace was gone. She had to catch Eoin before coming back to look for it. As she caught up to Eoin, she saw that he was holding the necklace. It was gently pulling towards the mountains. She was told never to go near the mountains. Eoin piped up > Look Aoife the necklace is pulling me there. I found mommy's earhole metal too. Aoife took a look at it. It was a heart embraced by two hands, a claddagh. It was definitely her mother's. She had received as a parting gift when the family was kicked out of the village after her grandmother's death. > And look! footsteps in the dust! She looked, and no doubt there they were footsteps leading to the mountain range. Perhaps out of desperation they had gone to the forbidden mountains for food. Maybe the monsters there had got them. Before she could think, Eoin ran towards the mountains. Aoife torn between fear and needing to know where her parents were, ran that way as well. They reached the range by evening. The sun was moving down. Eoin had slowed down. Tired and downridden from the sun, they entered into a sheltered area. They rested. Eoin was first up, always full of energy and started playing around. Aoife rested her eyes for a second longer, and drifted to sleep. She awoke to Eoin yelling. She frantically got up and started calling for him. She eventually found him. He had fallen through a shaft at the end of the cave. He could n't get up. Aoife, now crying, begged for him to try. Eoin being himself got bored and started walking away. He was mumbling about hearing water and being thirsty. Aoife begged, but could no longer hear Eoin. She slowly lowered herself into the hole, and jumped. The fall was n't great, but was large enough that she staggered. She limped a bit towards the water which she could hear. It was slapping sound, like her mother used to do them when she blamed the kids for being kicked out. Fear clenched at her. She ran down the shaft after Eoin. It was pitch black. She hit something, and heard a loud ouch, then splash. She then was falling headfirst into cool water. More water than she had ever seen in her life. Behind her Eoin was screaming. > Just stand you little idiot, its not deep. And give me back my necklace. Why did you come here anyways? Eoin said > I had seen dad's ring, and figured he came somewhere here. They sat in the water for some time, before Eoin said > look I can sun there at the end of the water tunnel. They waded and floated out of the cave. It was a disaster zone. This must have been the kingdom. The glory of the O'Brien clan prior to the roses. Buildings jutted out from the water. Flooded. There was land with a colour that looked yummy. This must have been what green was. ( Having seen blue in the necklace, and red whenever she cut herself ). They waded out to an outcropping of rock. In the distance was a large pillar of rock. As they climbed up they saw buildings in the distance, and a bridge that connected to it. The bridge lead back to the mountains. Had they not gone down the shaft, Aoife suspected they would've continued to a dead end. She saw a tiny blip on the bridge. Her parents must've found a way up to the bridge. Eoin had seen it to, and ran up to the top of the rock and started screaming for their attention. Aoife just gripped her necklace, rubbing the sapphire in her hand. As Eoin continued to scream, Aoife wished her parents would n't notice. Her parents who didnt care. Who blamed them. Who would've left them to die in squalour as they lived in the palace. As she thought this, her hands got hot and sweaty. Her knees grew week. The water dripped from her clothes. Anger boiled up. Anger she had surpressed for years. Little did she know that the sapphire was glowing in her tightly clenched hands. The sky grew darker the more her hate deepened. With that the pillar exploded open. The rock didnt crash down, but revolved around the menacing statue that had just appeared, glowing with the same light as the sapphire. The trinity circle emboldened across its chest. The earth shook, and at that moment Aoife realized that this must have been the last stand of the O'Brien Clan against the Roses. That she was in control of the saviour. That this would be the last stand of her parents. Aoife had returned home to reclaim her rightful throne", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I forget about important things like mood and flow, and just focus on telling the story, rather than weaving a tale. That means, I would assume, that I can be detail or content-heavy without much fluff, but I'd think that would mean that it tends to be very dry.

Whispers of doubt and worry. The sun grows fainter every day, blocked by a rush of white wind and gray sky.\" The shaman bowed his head in silence, signifying the end of our session. I let this news sink in momentarily before getting to my feet. As I leave his tent the shaman warns me, \" The gods see what you do Ulric. They see it, and they do not cry. They send us wind and snow. They scream at us chieftain, at you.\" Outside, the encampment is still. A few stragglers are huddled in fur, wading through the layers of snow that swallows us whole, while surrounding us, a sea of ice fading into the sky in the distance. I wrap my wolf skin tighter around me as a voice calls my name from nearby. \" Ulric, quickly!\" Sven, one of my closest companions hurries to me. I can see his breath escape him while he frantically gestures nearby. \" Jarl and his wife, it's their son!\" The blacksmith and his woman kneel to the ground beside their child, a boy on this earth no more than a decade. His face pale, his breaths fast and deep. \" He has not eaten in days\" Cried the woman, her face raw red with grief. \" My chief\" Jarl began, getting to his feet, his voice is defiant but his eyes are empty. \" We need food soon, real food! We can not survive on grains anymore!\" I looked down at the boy, his eyes staring blankly into a void, losing all connection with the mortal world. \" When will we ever leave this terrible place?\" cried his wife, burying her face into her son's chest. I had promised these people refuge. Security and freedom from the life we left. I know what had to be done. \" I will take the boy to the shaman\" I declared, lifting him up into my arms. \" He has herbs and medicines for such ailments! Sven will stay with you both. Stay here and pray to the gods for your son's health.\" They fell to their knees and thanked me as I rushed from the tent, briskly wading through the snow to the other side of the encampment, clutching the sick child to my body. I soon reached my destination. Inside was a man. A man I will not look in the eyes. A man who I will only speak to when absolutely necessary. His tent was lit by candle lights, illuminating a blood stained table covered in his instruments and a cauldron wide and horrible like the open mouth of a demon from hell. \" Ragnar.\" I whimper as my eyes cast to the ground. He turned to me and I could hear in his voice, he was as unhappy to see me as I was to see him. \" Another one eh?\" He grumbled turning his back in disgust. \" Can you stand boy?\" The child silently whispers in a nonexistent tongue. I lower him to the ground. After a moment finding his balance, he stands, swaying on his own legs. His fur blanket falls from him, revealing his withered, naked body beneath. He hardly seems to notice as his eyes keep starring into nothing. \" He looks sick\" snapped Ragnar, examining the boy from a distance. \" Too sick\". \" He will do\" I sigh, running my finger tips over the instruments on the table. I pick up a small hammer. Heavy, cold and blunt. There is no point putting it off any more. With one hard strike the boy falls to the ground. Blood trickles from his hair, soaking into the skin rugs at our feet. \" I must go speak with the Shaman now\" I say, placing the hammer back in its place. \" Give Jarl and his wife extra helpings this evening.

He promised him to let him know the name of his assassin as soon as he himself found out and he had every intention to keep that promise, if time did n't play a formidable trick on him. Like the dark tendrils of a bad dream that, too, was fading from his consciousness. For the first seconds after he woke up, he was certain to have dreamt all of it. He did n't doubt he was wounded; he could still feel echoes of the sharp pain from the moment the bullet hit the left side of his head. What he could n't understood was why the right side hurt so much, too. What he was convinced was a dream was the rest; his death, the conversation with Neumann, the waiting, the confusion, the loneliness, time itself going back and forth. His whole body felt peculiar. Understandable with head wounds. He noticed his new womanly parts only after he rose from bed to look around the room at the weird furniture, promptly fainting and hitting his head. He blamed his sudden amnesia on that, realizing what would the reaction be if he told people the truth. The king soon learned he was now queen Victoria, in the year 2015, that his empire fell to dust soon after his death and now the world was in the throes of a third world war. It took him far less to learn about all the bloodshed and mayhem that happened in his absence than it took for him to accept he was condemned to inhabit the body of a woman, with all that entailed. Soon, when war started, he was prepared. He personally planned and lead several decisive attacks, finally getting his men into Moscow. When the war was nearing its end the king would have loved to attack Norway, Finland, Poland and Denmark while they were weakened from the war effort, but one does n't attack his own allies and, besides, he had to stick o his vow of never starting an unjust war. He did n't regret that for long, as the fruits of victory were sweet. After the peace treaties were signed, Sweden asked for, and received, its former Baltic sea territories together with Sankt Petersburg, and much more, making Sweden again a powerful player on the international scene. -- -- -- -112 Awesome prompt, and it could n't come at a better time, as I'm currently reading Voltaire's biography on Charles XII.

Carl was an average teen who was neighbours with Larry under Dome C. Dome C was one of many large structures that sustain human life under the sea. Larry often had these secret meetings at the civic center, sponsored and advertised by the Wrotwood Daily Gazette. He often went off on rants about the dystopian society they lived in and the many rules that regulated their lives. Carl though found it funny that their society allowed people to voice these thoughts in a formal setting. \" Carl you made it… you kind of have to participate more than eating donuts, \" remarked Larry. \" Eating free donuts, \" emphasized Carl, who then continued, \" but I guess you're right. What do you want to talk about? \" \" Let's start with something we all can agree on. Free love, \" said Larry. Several people murmured in the background in agreement. \" Now I must admit, I'm a bit confused. Do you mean free to purchase love, love purchasing for free, or free to love who you chose? \" questioned Carl. \" See you are confused…I mean free to love who I choice…I mean why should the government stop me from marrying Mary and having two dozen children, \" Larry answered. The groups then started to exhibited more pack like behavior, with a large amount of howls and whoops in some attempt of common fraternity. \" Well for one thig I'm ninety percent sure Mary is your cousin. So aside from several genetic problems the Dome is not big enough to sustain everyone having two dozen children. \" explained Carl. \" Easily solved, \" countered Larry, \" they should expand the dome. \" Carl took a moment's pause to collect his thoughts before saying, \" Easily said than done. It takes time, people, and resources to do what you ask. That means these resources must be dragged from other sources like food processing or electric support. And of course the other sources would suffered in quality which would make our little dome based lives worse. And even then we can only expand as far as the nearest dome. \" \" You know I never thought about that… \" Said a voice in the background. \" Down with the government? \" questioned another voice. Sensing he was losing the crowd Larry went to his next point, \" How about freedom …you can't disagree with that… \" The crowd shrugged in agreement, after all who does not like freedom. \" Freedom to do what? \" asked Carl. Larry quickly came out with an example saying, \" Anything… Say why can't we gather several children and have them fight one another against those from other domes? \" \" Well aside from these people being children and the steep slope of fighting for amusement and fighting to the death …why would you want to antagonise the other domes? \" asked Carl. \" I never said that, \" said Larry who quickly came out with another example, \" how about why we can't leave the dome and go outside.... \" Continued Carl, \" Into the high pressure found on the bottom of the sea floor without training or special equipment. I have no idea. \" A hush silence began over the crowd. Larry was fumbling over what to say. \" Yes… well in any case we kind of lost our freedom due to harsh conditions that we live in. But the issue is being revisited every 4 years, \" said Carl. \" Ah ha. Why not every year…every month or day? \" exclaimed Larry. \" Because if we have a damn election every day we are just pushing more resources to pointless bureaucracy. And even then how much can a population change in one day, \" answered Carl. Larry was beginning to see people leave. Either he had to come up with some brilliant point or else his revolution would fail before it even started. \" How about supreme justice. Why do jurors and judges need to die when someone receives the death penalty? \" asked Larry. People stopped leaving as they wanted to see what Carl had to say. \" Well you got that kind of right. Yes they may die but only if the person was innocent as a sort of deterrent to using the death penalty in all cases but the extreme. Kind of eye for an eye scenario, \" explained Carl. \" Well it's not right \" exclaimed Larry \" What do you mean? \" questioned Carl,'That it's not right to sacrifice others who sentence to death an innocent man, woman, or child. Especially if they are unwilling to wait for the other data to come in. Hell if they are that unsure they could just give a different punishment. \" After this exchange the last of hall had emptied leaving only Larry and Carl in the room. \" Damn it.

Like the weather, the temple was gray, and like the mud she expected it to be foul smelling. She would have preferred to avoid going there but Eken'e, their athro, believed that every preinitiate should see something of the world before. As an elder with choice, Eken'e got her way. The other children her age from the village surrounded her. Maken'a, looking pretty as usual, seemed bright eyed and excited; Oneyk'a looked like she was more bruised and dazed than normal. Tatend'a and Monif'a were sounding just like their mothers, talking about the harvest. Finally, they had stopped under shelter in the ugly place. Eken'e was talking about The Fall, and Adis'a mostly tuned it out. Every girl in the village had heard about the fall enough times that they could repeat the song verbatim. Finally, Eken'e opened the hard-stuff box and there, in a blanket, were the precious artifacts of the past. One looked like a piece of polished onyx small enough to hold in your hand and thin enough to fit in a scabbard ( although it might be too wide ). Eken'e intoned reverently and all the girls listened. She told them that it was The Peace of Googl'e and whoever wielded it could ask any question and have it answered. That in those days, people had believed that Fachebok'e watched all they said and did, and people had to be good and purposeful or they would be unfriended by Fachebok'e and lose The Peace of Googl'e. Adis'a grew bored. The idea of a stone that could answer questions was ridiculous to her, and the gods of the former ones were unbelievable. Soon enough they were trudging back down the hill and Adis'a's thoughts turned to the offering for the shrine. The hillside was wet, but there was an orange flower she'd never seen before; perhaps Demet'e would like this one. The God of the Harvest wasn't easy to please, but lately she'd seemed to show a preference for unusual flowers.

At the peak of my career I was chosen as a member of Explorer I: the first manned flight outside of the solar system. As part of a five-man crew we were to go to Alpha Centauri orbit for several weeks then return. We'd cryo-sleep, wake up at AC then cryo-sleep back to Earth. One hundred years there and another hundred back. Everyone we'd known would be dead. Their children would be old and crippled, their grandchildren in charge of the world. We left as heroes. We expected a hero's welcome. We woke up on a technologically backwards Earth. We never woke up for Alpha Centauri. The cryo-sleep timers failed. We circled the star and returned to a Earth. Archived transmissions told us of a great war engulfing the world. We five separated and went our separate ways. Jacque and Hugo Bleu headed east. Klein Grau and McKenzie Snow stuck around. I made my life in the forest. The remaining tech allowed me to live there, to protect myself from the dangers. Snow thought I was a fool for not asserting my power, but I found a simpler life cataloging the local flora and fauna to be more interesting. After a life looking up I had now found one more satisfying looking down. Grau would visit. He'd found a simpler life making fireworks and reading books. A lifetime of relaxation proved very amicable for him. He'd taken a local name, Gandalf the Grey. I thought it suited him. I'd overhear the locals, when I'd go to town, reference a radagast, a tender of beasts. I thought it sounded nice. It had a dignified ring that echoed Charles. So, one day, I buried Charlie Brown, spacer explore. He was dead for all intents and purposes, lost amongst the stars. Born anew, amongst the plants and animals was Radagast the Brown, tender of beasts.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "You are a young Bruce Wayne, gone abroad to learn the ways of the criminals. While helping a gang heist a shipment, in order to learn how they operate, you discover that all the other \" criminals \" are actually wealthy heirs, attempting to gain the same experience themselves...", "output": "I had left Wayne Manor a few weeks ago for Los Angeles. The criminals were getting more idiotic. I needed to know how they thought. I found a gang in Los Angeles called the Grouts. They seemed like the perfect experiment. I planned to infiltrate the gang, rise through the ranks, then die in a mysterious accident, leaving the gang without a clue. I arrived and laid low for a few days. Meanwhile, I established my story. My name was Michael Davis. I was a 31 year old factory worker looking for some extra money. I live with my pitbull Thrasher in a run down house 20 minutes from the city. I recently moved from New York, where I was a bus driver. I have no family, they died in a mugging gone wrong. At least that was easy to remember. I was standing on the porch of a run down house. Two buff, tattooed thugs stood next to the door. Even without my equipment, I could take them. The one on the left had a limp, he favored his left leg, and the other one was a smoker, I could tell by his yellowed teeth. Hit the smoker in the throat, kick the other's left knee. The smoker's corroded lungs would struggle for air, and the one with the limp wouldn't be able to chase me. I could get to my bulletproof car before they could even pull a gun. This made their attempts to intimidate me amusing. The door opened, another tattooed goon ushered me inside. I was lead to a room halfway through the house. During my short walk, I was able to deduce nine different escape routes. I started on my tenth, but I was pushed into a room, forcing me to focus on the people inside. There was a large wooden table that took up most of the room. A man stood at the head, obviously the leader. Three other people sat at the table. Two women and a man. They glanced at me, but quickly turned their attention back to the leader. He looked at me. \" You're late. Take a seat. You call me The Head. What's ya name? \" I sat, putting on a slightly scared impression. \" Sorry, I'm Michael Davis. Call me Mike. \" He nodded and gestured to the other people. \" This is Jenna, Barbara, and Lucas. \" I nodded to each in turn. The Head turned back to the front of the room. On it, schematics for a shipping bay. \" So you four are going to be stealing a shipment from the port. Of what, it doesn't matter. Do this right, and you will become a fully fledged member of the Grouts, and receive your mark. \" He rolled up his right sleeve. A tattoo of a skull and knife rippled on his bicep. \" You will get a truck, drive to the port, and look for a blue shipping container labeled MSCU-400817. Inside there will be 5 wooden crates. You scum think you can handle it? \" We nodded without speaking. \" Good. Now get out. \" The door opened again, and the goon I saw earlier escorted us to a black pickup truck parked on the lawn. Remembering my fake backstory, I let someone else drive, claimed I didn't know the lay of the land. In actuality, I had memorized the city layout a few days ago. Jenna got in the driver side without a word. We filed in after her. She started the car, then pulled onto the road, starting the drive to the ports. We were silent for the first ten minutes. That was fine with me, it gave me a chance to analyse my new \" gang mates \". I started with Barbara. Her leg was shaking from nervousness. But the more I watched her leg, the more I realized it was fake shaking. There was an irregular beat to it. She was doing it on purpose. She had also placed her knee against the car door, creating a scraping sound. She wanted it to be known. This surprised me. I will have to be careful around her. I turned my attention to Lucas. He kept touching his face. Chin, nose, cheek, pause. Chin, nose, cheek, pause. The rest of his body was still. We went under a bridge, and I saw his face in the reflection of the front mirror. His eyes were focused straight on me. He was analysing me, sizing me up. Something about his gaze gave me the impression of intelligence. He quickly looked away when he noticed I could see him. I underestimated him as well. This mission was getting very suspicious. I focused on Jenna. She was driving perfectly. Even when a car suddenly cut us off, she was prepared. This reflex was coupled with a built body. She looked like the worked out everyday. She was certainly something to reckon with. She was the first to break the silence. \" So, what are your stories? I've been in this business for a long time. My old gang in Texas was the most ruthless around. I moved here to follow a guy, but he died in a car crash, leaving me alone. So I decided to join the Grouts, keeping up with the gang business. \" When went on for a while longer, speaking of a family in El Paso and a old house on a hill. She spoke about her childhood trauma. An abusive father, ruthless bullies, and the accidental killing of her pet cat. It would have been a moving story, if it wasn't fake. She spoke with a monotone voice, like reciting a speech before a crowd. Also, the story didn't match up. She said bullies broke her arm and had to get pins put into her arm. She even showed a scar from surgery. But the perfectly straight, faint scar was from a thin insertion of a scalpel, not a ugly bundle of pins and bolts. This scar was put there purposely, it conveniently missed large clusters of muscle. Lucas followed up with his own story. He was an orphan from Mexico who crossed the border in the trunk of farmers truck when he was 12. He then lived in Arizona on the streets, fighting and stealing for his food. He joined a gang and ran a cigarette ring. At one time he was smoking two packs a day. Eventually, he managed to get enough money from various jobs to buy a bus ticket to LA. He arrived a year ago, and cruised around doing work for various gangs. Once again, his story had major flaws. From the look of his body, he had never smoked. He showed no signs of a chain smoker, the yellowed teeth, stained fingers, shaky breath. And if had truly been smoking for that long, he would be smoking right now. It had been an hour since I first saw him, and he showed no signs of wanting a cigarette. Barbara went next. She was raised in a Nevada suburb. Despite the perfect environment for a kid, she was always a rebel, and eventually ran away to LA for an adventure. She was blown away by the violence and gangs, but adapted quickly. It was her third week in LA. This one was easy to break. If she had run away when she was still under parental supervision, she would have to be at least 18. By her build and composure, she was at least 27, making her story invalid. They went silent, waiting for my story. I took a deep breath and recited my story. They seemed to buy it. We spent the rest of the ride in silence. Finally we arrived at the dock. Parking the car, we snuck into the loading bay. To keep up with my story, I didn't point out the need for orange jackets, and the fact they they would be easily found in the staff room. But I was a nobody from New York, not the genius Bruce Wayne. Once we entered the bay, we crouched in the shadow of a container. Staring at eachother, we silently urged someone to go first. We stayed silent for a couple minutes, glancing at the surroundings and each other. It was like no one wanted to lead, just watch. I realized that we were more alike than I thought. We were all trying to get an inside look at the criminal mind. It all fit, the broken stories, the planted actions. Without a word, I stood up and left, never giving a backward glance. Time to start again. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hey everyone, About4001llamas here.

There are 27 minutes until my break at work is over, and I have to log off and slave away for the dollars I need. Sure, it's a long time.. but I just.. I need to de-stress. That's it. I've been under a constant hail of stress. It stays with me at home and at work, and these small breaks, where I'm alone and browsing on the computer, are like a slice of heaven to me. There are a few co-workers around me in the break room, re-heating their dinners, making coffee, watching the television we have. The commercials are on now, but it was playing a soap opera. 23 minutes now. Seconds seem to move faster when you cling on to them, like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. There's nothing on this computer for me. Nothing, I've seen what's on the front page of my favorite websites already. Wait. What was that? *audible whirring, distant, then a click, and the fade of everything that was using electricity* Jesus! It's dark! Why is it so dark? My co-workers are panicking too. I ca n't remember the last time I was covered completely by darkness's company. I stand up, half crouched, and feel my way to where I think the door to the hallway is, directing a few people to follow me. My phone. My phone's flashlight. I quickly grab it, bring up the flashlight app, and use it to guide me and my co-workers to the work room. My manager is gathering everyone about, giving specific orders to a few people. She sounds scared. Everyone sounds scared. What would cause this? There has n't been a power outage in nearly 200 years. My manager looks at me and my source of light, and screams \" LOLmouseLOL! Perfect, will you please run out back, find the generator and see what's wrong? This building is meant to be secure in the event of this kind of emergency, we have a back up generator.\" What could I do? It's up to me now. The way to the generator is complicated. Out of the work room, make a right, down a hallway, pass the locker rooms, another right, through a door, up two flights of stairs, then right out another door. Outside now. To the left, around the back of the building, through the red fence, and in the chain link fence. The generator is a classic bulky thing. Cylinder in shape, cold steel colored, and... running. The generator is running. What the shit? Then why are the lights off? Come to think of it.. we're actually the only building without power. I followed the large bundle of cords, that runs the power to the building, to try and see if there is something wrong there. Not but 20 feet later, I spot the problem. One man. Macho Man\" Randy Savage, back from the grave. He has my buildings power cords between his forearm and bicep, and is giving them a hell of a headlock. \" Ooooh yeah, Mach-o Man! What'chu gon na do?\" Unbelievable. This man has got to be near 300 pounds in muscle, AND he's back from the dead. Oh, did you think he was alive and well? No. He's a zombie. Hell bent on finding a power source to jolt him back to life. A noble task, but unfortunately, he's between me and those meager dollars I make. I know there's only one thing to do. Sucking in a huge breath, I bellow out \" HULKAMANIA IS GON NA RUN WILD ON YOU BROTHAAAAA\" He drops the cords instantly. Power comes on in my work building instantly. He turns his head at me instantly. Instantly.. I run back inside like a bitch. I lock the door, and hear him pounding. This is no good, he'll just go back to the power cords. I have to kill \" Macho Man\" Randy Savage. Again. I open the door, and he barrels in. A low sweep to his right leg sends him tumbling down the stairs. I jump on the guard railing, pump up my elbow, and leap for all I'm worth.... it connects! My elbow goes straight through his skull, leaving him dead in an instant.

{"input": "John Cena has died. He finds himself in Valhalla eagerly awaited by the great warriors of history. None of them are aware of pro wrestling's staged nature", "output": "Brynjolf awoke in the morning, just as he had every other morning for the past 1300 years. He quickly dressed and left his bedchamber; today was Nýjablóð, the Day of New Blood. Eager to see the warriors of the past decade ascend to join him and his blood brothers in Valhalla, Brynjolf scurried down the halls of Asgard to the great hall. Valhalla was mostly empty when Brynjolf entered, as was the norm for the immortal Viking. While most warriors filled their bellies with mead and spent their nights in the company of the men and women who accepted their illustrious seed or noble maiden-extract, Brynjolf had never occupied himself with such'hestur skít'. A warrior's place was on the battlefield. His drink was blood. His spasms were frenzy. Hustle. Loyalty. Respect. These were the only things worth celebrating. The hall filled up quickly over the next hour. Vikings from Geatland paraded loudly into Valhalla, not showing the slightest bit of their mead induced hangovers. Legionnaires from Rome walked in together in a tight formation not easily broken. The smell of sweet tobacco weed followed the Mohawks of Quebec. The sounds of clinking armor were everywhere when knights of the Christ god entered Valhalla. They were headed by Joan of Arc, who was leading her man-servant by his cock. By midmorning, Valhalla was bustling with the sounds of Mongol bow strings harmonizing with hussar wings. The smell of Rajput cannabis smoke was cut by the acrid stench of Navy SEALs'Bud Light. Off in a distant corner, a janissary was handling his opium trip poorly. Just as the sounds were getting to their peak, the noise was broken by a thunderous clamor. Odin, the King of Asgard, had called for silence. The ordinarily boisterous warriors of Valhalla fell deathly silent, save for the samurai, who always spent their time in silent contemplation. By Odin's side were his two sons, Thor, the Thunder Lord and Eric the Straightforward, otherwise known as Eazy-E. Stepping forward to his podium, Odin began his speech. \" Champions of Valhalla, today is the Day of New Blood, \" he began. \" Just as you once came to us on your Nýjablóð, today we welcome a new class of hero \". The excitement in the hall was almost palpable. The warriors of Valhalla were always delighted to welcome new blood. New sisters or brothers are an exciting prospect to warriors spending eternity together. The only exception to this was Cain, but Brynjolf never thought much of him and thus, took no heed when the Son of Adam mumbled some nonsense to himself. \" Heroes of Asgard, \" Odin continued. \" I proudly present to you your Valhalla Class of 2019-2029 \". Over the next three hours, Odin churned out one warrior after another, granting them their mead-horns and keys to the hall.'*Hesur skít*,'Brynjolf thought to himself. Brynjolf was admitted with *real* heroes. Ragnar Lodbrok, Rollo of Normandy and many other characters from the History Channel's hit TV show *Vikings*. \" Finally, \" Odin said with a smile. \" We will admit to our ranks this next champion. He is a hero of unwavering strength and indomitable will. He has braved the perils of Tables, Ladders and Chairs and has fought his way out of Hell… in a Cell. Ladies and Gentleman, from West Newbury, Massachusetts, JOOOOOOOOOOOOHN CEEEEEEEEEENAAAAAAAAA! \" The trumpets of Valhalla rang true and Brynjolf was aghast. John Cena was the viking's absolute idol. His bedchamber was besodden with portraits and woodcuts of the Marine himself, John Felix Antonius Cena. When John Cena defeated the deceptive Triple H at Wrestlemania 22, Brynjolf was so inspired that he was drove himself into a blood rage and killed an Apache warrior and a Roman gladiator in a Cena-esque one-on-two triumph of heroism. The hall erupted with applause, cheers and general excitement, except of course for the samurai. They were taking in John Cena's remarkable entrance in silent contemplation, as they did all things. By the time all the noise had calmed down and order returned to Valhalla, Brynjolf had made his way to the very front of the hall, eager to catch a closer glimpse of the Hero of West Newbury. When the hall was completely silent, John Cena approached the podium. \" Valhalla, I've made my career taking on all comers and facing all challenges. I've risen above hate and hustled my way to the top. But now I find myself in a position that I haven't seen since 2002: The newcomer. The hero without recognition, who needs to prove himself once again. And so, VALHALLA, are YOU ready for the JOHN CENA OPEN CHALLENGE?! \" The hall erupted into cheers and excitement once more. The front of the hall began to flood with would-be opponents for John Cena. That, however, was no cause of concern for Brynjolf. As far as he was concerned, only he could give John Cena both the respect and the challenge that came with hustle and loyalty. He snapped the neck of a centurion and climbed onto the dais on which his idol stood. John Cena looked over at Brynjolf, clearly impressed. \" What's your name, Viking man? \" John Cena asked. \" Brynjolf of Hjallaland, \" replied Brynjolf. \" And what makes you think you can beat me? \" John Cena inquired. \" Ruthless… \" Brynjolf said aggressively. At the mention of this first word, Eric the Straightforward looked pleased. \" Aggression! \" \" Then let's do this! \" cried John Cena who, with lightning fast reflexes, grabbed Brynjolf and put him in a fireman's carry. Before the viking could react, he was thrown onto the floor of the dais. He had just been on the receiving end of an attack he had seen John Cena perform countless times on inferior warriors. As Brynjolf lay dazed on his back, John Cena moved on top of him and began to punch the viking in the face repeatedly. In his daze, Brynjolf seemed to not feel the punches. It was almost as if John Cena was pulling them when they were mere inches from his face.'*Must be the blood rage*'Brynjolf thought to himself. \" Alright, I'm going to suplex you now, get up, \" Brynjolf heard whispered into his ear. The voice sounded surprisingly like John Cena's. Sensing trickery, Brynjolf raised his arms to defend himself. \" What are you doing, get up. We're gon na lose the crowd, fool, \" John Cena whispered, more loudly this time. Brynjolf could not move. He was in total shock. The Champion of the WWE, the Hero of West Newbury, John Cena, refused to give him the honor of true battle. Instead, he'd performed a mockery of true battle on Brynjolf, and before all of history's greatest warriors no less. In his shock, Brynjolf did not take notice of John Cena's arm placed over his chest, nor Odin's counting to three. He did not notice the trumpets of Valhalla blaring John Cena's musical theme, nor did he feel the ale being poured on him. The viking spent 1300 years waiting for a warrior to bring him a truly glorious battle, only to be made a fool. Brynjolf had not adjusted his attitude on the matter for centuries and, in mere seconds, had his attitude adjusted for him. As John Cena was being carried off by the crowd to a table, Brynjolf turned his head to catch a final glimpse of the man who had dishonoured him. But alas, he could not see him.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Not too long ago, a deep salvage team came across the life boat from a mining ship that was set to self-destruct, which somehow drifted right through the core systems fifty-seven years ago, and the last survivor, a female warrant officer, had been in hyper sleep the entire duration. She claimed that she detonated the ship to kill an alien life form which destroyed her crew after landing on the same moon where a terraforming colony now exists. I sent a mom and pop survey team from the colony to the location of the derelict ship the survivor mentioned, but was n't expecting it to be there. If I made a major security situation out of it, administration would have step in and there would have been no exclusive rights for the alien specimens if they were found, so I made no mention about the possibility of there being any alien life forms. They're worth millions to the bio-weapons division. We lost contact with the colony shortly after. It may have just been a down transmitter, but colonial marines and I were sent to investigate, and I convinced the survivor to come along as an advisor. When we entered the colony, we found it abandoned with several live alien specimens that could be brought back in stasis for the company. The survivor discovered that I sent the survey team to the ship without warning them and threatened to nail me right to the wall for the colonists'deaths. Afterwards, I released a couple of the specimens into the medlab with the survivor and the lone surviving colonist, a young girl, to impregnate them as they slept. They somehow managed to set off the fire alarm to alert the marines and hold off the specimens until the marines destroyed them. The survivor saw through my plan to get the embryos inside them back to the company and sabotage the other freezers to get them through quarantine, and as they were about to kill me, the room's power was cut. The aliens got around our barricades by traveling through the ceiling and began to fall into the room. I escaped through a door during the firefight and locked it before the survivor or anyone could get through, trapping them with the aliens. When I opened the door to get out the room, I saw a hissing, drooling two-meter tall alien standing in front of me. I thought it was going to kill me, but I woke up cocooned on the wall like the colonists were before being impregnated with alien embryos.

Looking at it as an adult, it was around the size of a big dog, but size was n't what made it so horrifying. The face of the beast was so grotesque and outlandish that I could n't bear to look at it for longer than a second. I glanced over at the nightmare, sure that it was poised to pounce on me and rip me to bits, but it was just sitting in the corner of my room, licking its paw. I brought my eyes to the floor and took a deep breath. \" Okay. You can do this,\" I mumbled to myself. Slowly, I tiptoed over to my bed and reached under it. I groped around under the bed, never taking my eyes off of the beast, until I felt my hand come in contact with the item I was looking for.

It was like a thousand horses stomping in unison. It shook him awake from his dreams of blackness. That's all he dreamt of now. Blackness. Thunder and lightning still rolled through the sky like a stampede, but blackness was all Jim could really remember. \" This is gon na go on for a few more hours,\" Jim said aloud to no one, \" no chance at going back to sleep now.\" His voice was full of relief, he feared the blackness was seeping deeper into his unconscious, and falling asleep was starting to haunt him more than the landscape of emptiness he now inhabited. Jim stood up and dusted himself off. He looked around to see if anything had changed since he'd fallen asleep. The empty cars were still there. The sign reading \" Portland- 20 Miles\" was right where it was before. The sky was still red. \" Check. Check. Check.\" Jim said to himself as he pointed to all of the reminders his solitude. It'd been 4 months since the end. 4 months since the sky ripped open and everyone disappeared into dust. 4 months he'd been wandering from town to town. Jim had not found another person in 4 months. \" Well, I'd always wanted to check out Portland,\" again, speaking aloud to nobody. \" Maybe I can finally get these damn braces off. Heard it was the dentistry capital of the world. Even if it's not, I say it is, and no one can argue,\" Jim chuckled madly and sadly. Jim stumbled down the road. He kicked some rocks here and there. Checked some cars. None started. Walked another few miles. Fell asleep again. Stuck in the blackness. Woke up again feeling lucky to be in a land where everything was physically depressing and not just abysmal black. Walked some more. It was a routine Jim had grown used to, one he started to find comfort in. Anything but the blackness. Finally, Jim reached Portland. Tired, but curious about this new town he stepped foot in. \" HELLO!\" Jim Yelled out. No reply. No surprise. Jim continued to walk around. There was no particular route he took. He just kind of went from street to street. Left. Right. Right. Left. Eventually, he lost track, but he did n't mind. He was just enjoying the walk. \" Right. My next turn is going to be a right,\" Jim said aloud to nobody. Jim made his right turn and stood in awe. In front of him was a brightly lit sign that said \" The Fair Orthodontist.\" Jim stood there, mouth agape. \" Some nice chompers you got there!\" A voice yelled out. \" Come in and let me have a look!\" Jim was stunned. He'd not heard another voice in 4 months. \" Damn braces off,\" Jim said to himself as he ran up the stairs, \" why did n't i wish for a harem?\" \" Good question!\" yelled the Orthodontist. She had a golden aura about her. Blonde hair wrapped in a bun. Wearing a white lab coat hiding her scrubs. Jim suspected the coat hid more. \" Come have a seat!\" the Orthodontist exclaimed. \" Why should I?\" Jim asked. \" Because you have n't seen a person in months. Still have n't, actually...\" Jim was befuddled. \" Wha... AAAAAAHHH\" Jim was in the chair. He did n't realize he was already in the chair. He had a dental mouth opener spreading his lips and shining his braces to the Orthodontist. \" HHWWIIEEUU,\" whistled the Orthodontist. \" Have n't seen teeth this nice since Georgey W. How long have you had these braces?\" \" IIHAAEEMMMOOOEE.\" gargled Jim. \" Oh, that long?\" asked the Orthodontist rhetorically. \" Well, the good news is you wo n't need them any longer.\" She paused. \" So, how's your day been?\" She inquired in a way devoid of curiosity or caring. \" IHINKOORUSSIIIINGOOAAIIKAAHHHOK\" Jim replied. \" Why, yes, I am just trying to make small talk. Is n't that what your human orthodontists do? I believe it's to make you feel more comfortable in a position of vulnerability.\" \" UUEEEH?\" Jim voiced. \" I'm going to ignore that. Anyways, you seem to have the perfect set of teeth that I need to reverse all of this.\" the Orthodontist said as she pulled the dental opener out of Jim's mouth. \" Reverse all of what?\" Jim asked as he rubbed his jaw. His lips still hurt. \" This apocalypse my King and Queen have brought into your world. I'm afraid Titania and Oberon are having another one of their tiffs.\" said the Orthodontist as she shook her head. \" It's not the first one either. I believe the last time this happened was toward the end of your 18th century.\" \" WHAT!?\" replied Jim. \" Oh yes, and I had to clean things up then too.\" said the Orthodontist. \" Ok lady, you're gon na tell me what's going on. Where is everybody? Who are you? Who are your king and queen? 18th century? What?\" Jim lost his words. \" Do n't worry too much my dear. All you need to know is that you can end this. But you'll need to make a sacrifice.\" said the Orthodontist. She pulled out a burlap sack. \" Now sleep.\" Her voice got deeper and began to resonate in Jim's very skull. \" Do n't be afraid of the blackness.\" She whispered, a whisper that nearly rendered Jim deaf. She sprinkled the dust from her sack onto Jim's eyes. \" Do n't fight it.\" Jim was in the blackness. He hovered over nothing, surrounded entirely by abysmal black. \" Calm down, Jim.\" He said aloud to no person. \" Remain calm. Do n't be afraid of the blackness. Breath.\" Jim was stuck there. For how long, he did n't know. Eons or seconds. He floated in the emptiness. He just simply was. Suddenly, a star appeared. A glowing white beacon. Jim was mesmerized. He did n't know what or why, but he was just happy to see something other than black. Before long, another appeared. And another. Dozens of them. Jim began counting the stars. He counted thirty one in totally. Thirty one gleaming stars in the blackness. The stars began forming a circle around Jim. Spinning faster and faster. The circle closed in on Jim. All thirty one stars slammed together in a brilliant flash and then. Whiteness. There was only whiteness. Jim awoke to the sound of honking. It was like a thousand honking outside his window. It shook him awake from his dream of whiteness. That's all he remembered now. Whiteness. The cars were honking and Jim was drowsy. He could n't quite get up, a lot of his body was numb. He lay in his bed, listening to his neighbors scream at each other and the people on the sidewalk talk overly loud on their cell phones, waiting for the rest of his body to come back online. He stretched his limbs and felt a wad of cash beneath pillow. Excitedly, he pulled the stack of 31 bills out from under his pillow and looked at them. Each was a dollar bill, only with his face in the center. He looked through them and grew angrier and angrier as he saw each bill. By then, most of his facilities were back. He swiped his tongue throughout his mouth, horrified to find he only had one tooth left. \" AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGG\" Jim roared aloud, to everyone.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Trey, Steven thought, was as weak as a butterfly on a glass needle, as beautiful and precious too. He loved that man with every ounce of his being. In him he could loose him self and run from the violence, his past, La Familia. They'd spent almost all the day before looking at Trey's new drawings. He was making a comic book. Sitting their looking at those Bristol board sketches only half inked is where Steven would have chosen to be until the universe died. Gregory's room small, stark, and sterile. It smelt of bile and vomit barely hidden under lemon scented antiseptics and bleach. It was n't the room his father would want to die in, Steven thought. No, his fathers style was exotic woods and brass shined to a mirror finish. \" Papa?\" Steven said as he crept next to the man in the bed. Tubes ran from his nostrils, machines with accordion pumps and buzzing beepers played along. \" Who...\" groaned the living corpse of his father. \" Steven\" he said. \" Why you come here boy?\" Gregory asked, wheezing and nastily. \" To say my good byes.\" Steven said then took a seat in the wooden chair next to the metal bed that his father would die in. \" You said'em soon enough you decided to be a faggot.\" Gregory said, his throat catching with coughs. Steven gripped the chairs arm. \" How'd it happen?\" \" The shootin'?\" Gregory said. \" Some fuck got me out side of The Olive, just finished...\" Gregory stopped to hack up film. \" Ambushed me.\" \" You always said the ambush was the way to go.\" Steven noted. \" Yeah, you learnt that did n't you. Now if you could just learn it ai n't natural what you're doing.\" \" I heard you laid there for a while before some one found you. How come they did n't hear the gun shots?\" \" The bitch, it was a blonde cunt god dammit, used a silencer.\" Gregory said. \" Like the one you taught me to shoot on, a nine millimeter was it?\" \" Yeah, I'm surprised you'd remember that. You where more into faggot shit then, what did you call it, fucking drag?\" \" Drag performance, it's a kind of social satire.\" Steven corrected. \" I do n't give a fuck. Your sister, where is she?\" Gregory asked. \" On the way, I rented her a car. Made sure it worked my self.\" \" Good, good, at least my good child will get to see me before my surgery. Yeah, the doctors say I'll be fine. Fucked my liver up but they got a transplant.\" \" You do n't say.\" Steven said. \" You do n't say.\" \" Why are you here boy?\" Gregory asked. \" You ai n't come to see me since you was sixteen. You ai n't getting no inheritance, that's your sisters.\" Steven smiled. \" Surgery is dangerous you know, there can always be, what do they call them? Complications? Trey, my partner, his uncle is actually the head surgeon here ya know? He's told me a lot about complications.\" Gregory shifted in his bed. \" Do n't speak of it.\" \" Why not papa? Does it scare you?\" \" I ai n't afraid of nothing.\" Gregory said. Steven looked at his frail father whose wrinkled hands were gripping the metal railing of his bed so hard his knuckles threatened to burst from his skin. \" You do n't realize what just happened do you?\" \" You trying to get some inheritance.\" Gregory spat. \" Brighter than you look. Listen papa. I know you hate me and you wo n't see me again. Goodbye.\" Steven said while standing up. \" Oh, I brought you a gift.\" \" Huh?\" Again Steven smiled and reached into his pocket. He set the gifts on his fathers chest, a pair of cutters and a slash of blonde wig hair. \" Complications.\" he said as he left the room. Trey was waiting for Steven. He hugged him as soon as he left the room. Steven wanted to cry but now was the time to go. As they left he told his beloved, \" You know, I think I got through to Papa. I convinced him to put me in his inheritance. You wo n't have to go back to work. You can keep doing your comic.\" Stevens sister would have gotten the inheritance, had she not lost control of her car and went off a bridge on the way to the hospital.

Anything and everything you can think of relating to climbing, camping equipment capable of suspending itself on a ninety degree wall, and weapons. \" If the bastard decides to show his face, I'll give him a mouthful of anything I feel like. I brought two AK-47s made to fire steel, iron, or silver ( in case I run across any werewolves, or in case I feel like spending twelve thousand dollars a minute to fire it ), as well as a shotgun equipped to fire steel, iron, and silver slugs, and shrapnel grenades fitted to explode bits of iron ( I would have brought different varieties, but... well, they're REALLY expensive ). I chose the AK-47 because when was the last time you saw one of those things jam? I also brought several knives and tools made of steel and iron, in the hopes that he wo n't mess with them. \" I'm going to carry all of this via the help of my buddy TurBo. TurBo is a helicopter that... well... he generates LOTS of lift. Magnets, helium, the actual quadcopter blades, etc. Every night, this guy's power core will burrow deep underground to charge it's batteries on geothermic energy, or really you can just chuck it in lava. He's also indestructible, thanks to several layers of titanium and, you guessed it, iron. Even without TurBo, I've got a MiniTurBo ( aka jetpack ) to help me get up rock faces and I've got a few months'worth of food and water on me, as well as camping equipment, etc. \" Funding came from hacking into a casino's mainframe and causing one of its main slot machines to spew out a jackpot as well as many, many, *many* loans ( aka bets on whether I'll live ). If you can figure out who it was that I cheated several million dollars out of, well... hats off to you. I'll even pay you back tenfold when I get back so long as you do n't press charges! \" But enough talk on preparations. My plan is to play it as safely as possible. Conserve ammunition and my own health. If I lose TurBo or a limb, I'm pretty fucked. I wo n't turn back though. I'll keep going until I can make it to the top and be there to stare him in the face as I declare victory over this mountain.\" I finished my speech as I looked out over the cheering crowd ready to watch me climb to either my death or my immortality, remembered in the history books as the first to climb and conquer Everest. But you see, I do n't plan on reaping the wisdom and treasures at the top. My son is one of the many who have climbed mountains intent on reaping the rewards at the top, and one of the many punted off of them.

The WHO had confirmed the disease, as had the UN and every major news organisation out there. Surprisingly enough, the nation's leaders had remained silent, choosing to hunker it out in fear within their nuclear bunkers. Rioting had begun in the streets, an ironic move since the rioters would after 24 hours have no idea what they were fighting for. The CNN report I was watching was clear and straightforward. On July 1st, 12:04 PM ( UTC ), all of our current memories would be lost. Forever. I did n't care about the actual science behind it, but knew that basic knowledge and ideas would remain indisrupted. Therefore, we would become amnesiacs, knowing the outer shell of life but failing to remember the details. It would be possible to walk and talk, but without knowing what our names were or where we lived. Humanity would go into shambles. My life would be destroyed - unless I took some kind of action. Looking on Facebook, I saw messages from friends inviting me to parties, asking me to go out for a bite, wanting a last Skype call before we forgot each other entirely. It was sad, but I turned each and every one of those request down. What's the point of having fun now if you'll just forget it all 24 hours later? I sat down at my desk, thinking. My parents had urged me to write a diary many years ago, but I was, like most teens, too lazy for that. Now, I regretted my choice. I was camera-shy, not having much pictures to share. I never bought a school yearbook. My memories were only documented in one place - my mind. Somehow, I had to get all that out of there and onto paper before it was too late. I wrote down my computer and account passwords first, then the locations of all my important documents. Then, I flipped to a blank page on my notebook. Time to write down everything I remembered. My friends, my family, the past, the present. What things I liked to do, the places I went on vacation, the stories of my family passed down from generation to generation. Trying to fit it all down on paper. Hopefully, when the amnesia fell, I would read it - and form the new neural connections that would help me remember the past.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

But that indifference did n't last long, as a sea of previously muffled discontent towards his character started boiling to the surface. Actions started taking on new meanings which he could n't easily explain, and people started acting in ways he could no longer adequately comprehend. He began questioning the very core of his existence, repeatedly uttering the words, \" What do you mean?\". His questions varied from trying to understand the conflicting messages sent by the opposite sex, to trying to understand how we all must eventually face the reaper. Through it all, the same question kept repeating itself: \" What do you mean?\" This question shook the very core of his existence. He became pushy and ruder as this lack of understanding pushed him to the brink of insanity; he implored people to make up their minds, as he simply could not understand how their otherwise perfectly natural indecision toward him could be possible. But alas, young Justin was fighting a losing battle. As the haze that had previously engulfed him continued to clear, he realized that the concept of others having problems unrelated to him seemed queer. His questioning began taking on a new tone, one of reconciliation and acceptance. Young Justin realized that he was slowly becoming a prophet, and what better way to show people this than to make them question themselves. He implored people to explain how they were not always completely happy and content like him. His newly found greatness soon started manifesting itself as paranoia. It grew until it burst through the seams. He started blaming people of being overprotective of him. He blamed them for not knowing what they wanted: after all, how could anyone possible say \" no\" to young Justin? How could anyone possibly want to walk away from young Justin? These simply were not possibilities in the mind of humanity's newly minted savior, which pushed him to ask the same question with even more vigor, \" What do you mean?\". This slow descent into insanity masquerading as an attempt to understand the human condition was reaching its apex. He implored humanity one last time to make up their minds, but much like Charles Ives never managed to answer the unanswerable question, with each additional attempt becoming more jumbled and harder to understand, young Justin never received a satisfactory reply. His new reality had been established, and until an orderly arrived with a mop and a strong disinfectant, that reality smelled like shit.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

She walked off calling him an asshole under her breath. I kept handing mail out like I have the last eight months at this crummy internship. Greg constantly bragged about his cooking skills to get women to come over, but he and I both knew he was the'greatest lover in the world'. I've been stalking him for the last 6 months, and that's all he ever talks about. While I've been high and dry for the last 3 years, it takes Greg only 3 days to get someone to bed. Tonight, it's gon na take 3 hours to get to his house, hide in the closet, and wait until he comes home. Bimbo or not. I'm gon na break his neck like some covert ops, or something. Easy and clean with enough force in the right place. I admit, if I can get these skills in bed, it might help me get enough confidence with women. *Shhh*, I thought to myself, *he's here! *.like a lazy ox, he slowly stumbled in. Greg was drunk, this would be easy. He fell down and I knew it was my time to strike. I ran out the door and charged him. Punching Greg in the jaw hurt, but at least he fell down. Screw it, I'm not gon na waste my time with the broken neck, I'm just gon na strangle him. I took off Greg's belt and fastened it on his neck. I was gon na make it look like he asphyxiated. As the belt tightened and tightened, I knew he struggled less and less. Staring at the digital clock, three minutes passed. Then five. Then seven. I did n't want him to survive. After ten minutes of suffocation, I propped him in the closet and left him to be found. I went to a bar a few days later, getting my head clear with some shots. I met a dame later that evening, and heading back I knew we were going to do the do. With this new'ability'old Greg have me, it was going to be a night we'd never forget.... The sex was awful. It lasted for about 30 seconds, and she was dry as a desert. After she left disappointed, I went to the kitchen to make a snack. A sandwich or something. As I was in there everything felt right. The'quick snack'ended up being some fancy Restarunt level stuff. It was like a million orgasms in my mouth! Tasted a lot better too. And then I realized...

It has the perfect sunspot, and a grand view of the jungle outside; the jungle being a place that I love to look at but would not soon take the chance of ruffling my long beautiful hair in. I am midst-bathe when I hear a click, a squeak… could it be my favorite furry-faced human!? The last time I saw him leave, he did so with several suspiciously moving things that contained the materials he drapes on his body for protection. I remember this distinctly because I was taking a cat-nap inside of it, as I like to do, and was shoed out right in the middle of a good dream. Apparently, my human doesn't want a souvenir of my hair resting on his materials when he isn't with me. I come down off my throne and prance toward the familiar noise with my womanly-trot, awaiting his greeting. Within seconds I am scooped up into his long-paws and given a loving squee- wait. Something smells different. OH GOODNESS IT ISN'T HIM. MEEOOOOWWWWWWWW! \" I moan, and begin to squirm my way out of that death-hold. Fortunately I made it to the hard place below me alright… but, alas, I was mistaken yet AGAIN. It wasn't him! No... It wasn't. It was the needy, hairless one with the high-pitched voice. Nevertheless, I lower my head in dismay and proceed to trot toward the place that never disappoints my stomach. She follows me, says a bunch of things I don't understand and keeps petting me, although all I want is something to eat. My favorite human would have gotten the hint by now, but I continue to oblige with the petting because at this point I'm making the \" rrrrrrrrr \" sound and there's no turning back. Moments later, I hear another clicking sound. Could it be? Again, I trot toward the sound and await the human with the furry face. The structure that normally forbids my access to the jungle world outside disappears. IT'S HIM!!!! I can hardly contain my affection and excitement! I aggressively weave between his lower long-paws to make my mark, and then I collapse onto the floor to show my belly for good measure. The furry-faced human picks me up holds me against his face. Oh, how I missed him! He is excited to see me too, and he keeps saying things in his high-pitched tone which is only reserved for me; well, was reserved for only me until the needy one showed up. Speaking of the needy one, I was only able to bask in this incredible shower of affection for a second until she practically forced me out of his long-paws so she could have them around her, instead. My human doesn't even react to that, no, because now my human says things I don't understand to her in his high-pitched voice, and now he has his long-paws around her - petting her in the same way he pets me! Except, they do this thing with their tongues that is utterly disgusting yet entirely intriguing, and I can not seem to turn away. And they won't stop. I keep trying to nudge my way in but it is useless. I see my human pick her up and walk toward the place with the very large soft thing that they take their long naps on; the soft thing, I too, like to nap on when she isn't there. I piddle paddle around, follow them in and take my seat on the hard surface at the end of the soft thing. I wait for my human to notice me again, but now they've begun to rid themselves of the weird materials they usually parade around in. They won't stop looking at one another and doing that gross tongue thing. I don't know what it is but I can't look away. Now they're… oh goodness now they're moving their bodies in weird ways and I think something must be wrong! I've seen this before, but it alarms me every time; what if something is wrong with my human!? I jump up to get a closer look, but immediately regret that decision once one of their human parts comes toward me fast and practically ends one of my 9 lives.

I was transcendent; I believed that I was the last human left. Or NASA forgot about me or just did n't care enough about their spacecraft to come find me. I began to become frightened, as the farther and faster I went, the more empty space got. I gaze out into the deep void of space, looking for anything. Nothing. Just nothing. I had run into the wall, I had found the nothingness that NASA had described. I did n't believe it. The universe is infinite, I did n't believe it. Was there just an infinite about of nothingness with a patch of matter known as the observable universe to Earth? Frightened, I attempt to signal out to any and all spacecraft that might somehow be nearby. Obviously, nothing. My computer had no number displayed to how far I was from Earth. Theoretically, I was an infinite distance away. I attempted to turn my ship around, but had no luck. I was being pushed deeper and deeper into space, and there was nothing that I could do about it. -- I stopped moving days ago. I do n't know where I am and I've lost my sense of reality.

The computer begins the automated landing sequence and I land perfectly. I take one last deep breath before I step off into this new world. I open the hatch into the world, and I gasp. I had landed on Earth. I see humans running towards me, wearing rugged clothing and looking angered. They each carry sticks and spears, and I realize that I was seen as a threat. I quickly take off my helmet in an attempt to show that I was too, a human. Nevertheless, I was too late.

The primitive humans dismantled much of the spacecraft, rendering it broken beyond repair, especially by such primitive humans.

Puzzled, he tries picking up the rock, for he could feel how the density of the rock was much more thick than any rocks he had encountered.

Of course I was interested in checking it out, I could n't remember what I was writing so I just wanted to find it and laugh a little at my teenager self's comments. Google search is a funny thing, though. I typed my username ( the same one I've been using since I went on the internet for the first time ) and a freaking myriad of results popped out. I had to scroll a little to find that forum and by the time I clicked on my profile page my eyes have skimmed over quite a few other search results. I looked at my posts and chuckled at some while physically cringing at other. I was a really awkward kid. Eventually, I closed that tab as I could n't handle my teenage persona anymore and found myself looking back at the Google's search result page when something caught my eye. Just a few links above was a sub-reddit bearing my online nickname. I know how reddit works, I've spent quite a bit of time there so you can imagine my surprise when I saw that. I stared into it for a few seconds, confused and intrigued, before I clicked that link. While the page was loading my cat climbed into my lap and while I was petting her my mind jumped to a conclusion that my name is probably weirdly connected to some crazy Japanese cartoon. The corner of my mouth jiggled as I looked up to the screen. My eyes widened and my heart missed a beat before getting a shot of adrenaline which put me into the most alert state I have ever been in. Urge to jump out of that chair was strong, but I settled to just violently removing my headphones. There was no music coming from them but I still wanted to be fully aware of my surroundings. The cat has disappeared from my lap seconds ago and my ears could n't hear her anymore. Top post had over a thousand upvotes and it was a picture of me I had taken the day before. Mouse scrolled down instinctively, uncovering daily posts about me. Where I went and what I did there and whom I did it with! I have n't even told people I know these things! There were hundreds of comments on all posts talking about me, like I'm the star of my own Truman Show! Without a thought, I jumped out of the chair and grabbed my hair. I looked up and down while my eyes began to tear up. I felt violated in the worst possible way. I did n't know where to go or what to do or even who to talk to. My left knee touched the chair I was sitting in moments ago as I frantically checked the rest of the sub-reddit. There were posts discussing my relationship choices, my health issues, there were even pictures of my room! I never took those pictures! My right hand left its place hovering above the mouse and joined my left on my devastated face. Teary eyed, I looked at a comment which said they ca n't wait to see me tonight. I let out a short scream. Halfway through it, reason came over my emotions. There was a sound coming outside my door and it sounded more sinister than everything I just saw and read. I abruptly paced a few steps away from my chair away from the front door. My legs had no idea what they were doing. While trying to contain sobbing, I listened to any sound that would come to me, but I faced the silence in which I stood for a prolonged amount of time before my thoughts came back. I lived on a first floor of an apartment building which I also shared with few offices. It was a middle of the day, and of course somebody was going to walk outside my door every now and then. I took a deep breath before closing my laptop without even looking at the screen. Me opening closet door and changing into a more reputable outfit was now a lost memory as I was hastily locking my apartment door. The hallway and steps above seemed empty and I went downstairs while putting the keys in my back pocket and grabbing my phone which was in the front one. I narrowly avoided slamming face into the front door of my building as my shaking hand was going through the contact list trying to find my best friend's number. The traffic outside my building was unusually loud, but by the time I found her number that was n't my concern. As I stopped in my tracks, my head turned back so fast I might have given myself whiplash. I was not even twenty feet away from my buildings front entrance, but I felt someone was watching me. I stood there, like a deer caught in headlights, unable to come up with a rational thought. So, I ran. As hard as I could, as fast as I could, as long as I could. Even though I had no headphones, loud action packed music was screaming in my ears as my heart was winning the race with my feet. I'm still not sure how I managed run down all those stairs without breaking my ankles. Packed train was closing its door only a second after I managed to squeeze myself in and people subtly tried to sneak looks at me, but despite that I felt like I outran whoever was chasing me. There was barely any room in the train to stand or grab onto something so I would n't fall, but I managed to stabilize myself somehow and take out my phone again to try and contact my friend. In the moment I found her name and just before I pressed that dial button my head shot up. Not because of what was happening in front of me, but because I thought I found a culprit to \" my\" sub-reddit. My hand steadily got lower while my mind pointed out the hundreds of comments and upvotes I saw. Even if she created fake profiles, she's not that much of a lunatic to create hundreds of them, is she? When my mom died, Tammy, my best friend, was all I had in the world. Her and her family took me in, despite me being nineteen at the time and they took care of me like I was one of their own. Her mother became my moral compass and I did needed that sense of direction during the years that came. I felt like I could talk her about anything, even things that I could n't tell Tammy. When my ex boyfriend assaulted me, she was the one who made sure his ass got behind bars. She is awesome like that, but last year me and Tammy moved to Los Angeles, she to become an actress and me to get out of Oklahoma so we lost touch a little bit. The now almost completely empty train stopped and I brainlessly made my exit. This was the route I had already taken so many times that my body went here on instinct, but my mind was n't sure if this was the place to be. My legs moved tentatively and in a very snail-like fashion I made my way up the subway stairs while still firmly gripping my phone unsure of what my plan of action was. I thought confronting Tammy was the best solution, but at the same time I wanted to toss my phone into the ocean and just go home. I obviously did n't come up with a decision when I knocked on her door. After a first knock, I stood there like a cow looking at sky, utterly unaware of the environment or any idea about what might happen. A lot of time has passed between my first and second knock, mainly because I forgot to knock again, but also because no one was answering. I was expecting her to open the door, probably in her bathrobe, pissed off that anyone was disturbing her on her day off. Few minutes have passed and I was beginning to wonder if I'll find comfort here even if she did open the door. I texted her, asking if she was home and sat on the stairs in front of her building while waiting for the text back. My thoughts finally caught a red light and I was able to think about it all. This ca n't be real, can it? I mean, it's just bizarre, I've never been remotely famous or even met anyone famous, despite living in the city where being a celebrity is all anyone ever wanted. Tammy replied with a simple \" work: ( \" and my mind was made up. She was the only lead I had in uncovering this creepy mystery that was going on and luckily I had the keys to her place so the door made no complains as I gently unlocked it and stepped in. Lights were already on and it seemed like someone was already there, but I chalked it off to Tammy being her forgetful self and forgetting to turn them off. I left them on and carefully made my way through her messy living room. I did n't want her to know I was there, but my mind only recognized one thing and that was her laptop somewhere in the depths of dirty clothes which was her bedroom. Luckily, I pretty much knew where she left it so I opened it and quickly went for her browsing history. I knew she was n't smart enough to delete it or even use private browsing so I kept scrolling, now even checking what dating sites she was visiting months prior. There was no sign of her ever posting on that creepy sub-reddit or even ever going to reddit in general. My heart sank, but I closed her computer and put it back into its place before quickly moving out of her bedroom. I was n't so careful with my steps while walking back through her living room, and I sincerely doubt she'll notice, but that still was n't what my usual self would do. I left the lights on even though I knew she would n't spot the difference and locked the door behind me, twice as I always do. Train ride back home was seamless, mainly because was mind has frozen, unable to comprehend anything that was happening in front of it. Right now, I ca n't even remember when I got home or did I even make dinner. All I know is that there are thousands of people out there, looking at my private pictures, knowing more about my life than me and I ca n't do a thing about it. I have n't turned on my laptop ever since I've gotten home and it'll remain that way for a while. It's late, and I'm tired, but with what I know I'm not sure I'll just slip into my pajamas and lay in my comfy bed. There is half a bottle of vodka left from when Tammy threw me a surprise birthday party and some pain pills I have left from the time I broke my ribs. I just want to fall asleep.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

We do n't have time. What story could I possibly tell to describe all this? You said I'd be prepared, trained. We were going to take years to write it!\" Our civilisation's growth, its infighting.

We can send one last message to our enemies ( and to any other races that may be listening, abstaining, as so many of them have ). And by god, I can not imagine what to say. How do you sum up a race? A myth? By scripture? But religion of the world can not be boiled down so fast. And to choose any one would be to imply the others are less. It's impossible to document them all.

I failed the assignment. My teacher said it was n't funny to make light of the fact that my father had died but I was n't making light of it. I was desperately asking for help. I had n't slept a full night in years. It's been seventeen years now and no one believed me. I sleep thanks to medication from a therapist that is certain my father abused me. He did n't. He was a great man from what I remember. He does n't want to hurt me or he would have by now. I mean, seventeen years ago he died and for sixteen years he's been sitting on the end of my bed and talking to the empty space. He does n't look at me and I do n't want to touch him, I'm afraid of what he is. There's only one problem. I met a girl. As is usually the problem with young men. She's beautiful and funny and I love her but she's beginning to wonder why her boyfriend wo n't let her stay at his place. Once you turn twenty five people start to ask questions about the things you do. It's no longer youthful stupidity or strangeness. That's why I'm here now. Tonight I have to put this to rest. I turn off the lights and lay on the covers. I close my eyes and wait, not for long. He does n't speak, he makes strange noises that mean nothing to me. It's like he's muttering a different language to himself. He's thin, not like I remember, but I ca n't quite see him in the darkness. His face is outlined against the wall but barely his profile. He's hunched and gnarled and bony. I sit up and shuffle towards him. My heart pounds in my chest and my stomach churns. I'm afraid of this thing. They've made me afraid by telling me it's not real and I'm crazy. I should be afraid of the dark thing that sits on my bed. I reach a hand out, shaking as it stretches and stretches towards his shoulder. He stops all movement, muttering, and breathing when my hand touches him. I'm afraid to move and he is n't, finally after an eternally long pause, I manage a word. It's breathless and raspy from the dryness in my throat but it comes out. \" Dad?\" He lifts his head but that's all. \" Dad?\" He tilts his head to the side like he's remembering the word, milling it through his brain like it's a mystery to him. He slowly turns his head towards me and I realize something. After all these years I'd never been this close. I'd never seen his face but from the side. As he turns to face me, this deathly figure that's been at the foot of my bed for almost as long as I can remember, I see a birthmark on his cheek. A birthmark I do n't recognize. This.

{"input": "It turns out if you're a virgin at thirty a human becomes a wizard, however the government wants to stop this from happening at all costs.", "output": "\" Yer a wizard, Harry,\" said Haggard, a very large man. His clothes were old and tattered, his mouth a big, friendly, misshapen and yellowed mess, his beard great, brown, and bushy. He smelled of urea and body odor. Harry turned from his computer desk to face Haggard, wiping cheezo-puffy dust on his MLP shirt. He had a beard of his own, though it more resembled a great mass of overgrown pubic hair than Haggard's own glorious, food-encrusted mane. A small collection of pissbottles lay behind him on the floor. \" I'm... I'm a what?\" \" Yer a wizard!\" Haggard replied, moving in closer to Harry. \" Come on! We have to get you to Asswarts! Yer going to miss yer first class!\" Harry was silent for a moment, before his acne-ridden face grew foul. \" You're one of those normies, are n't you?\" Haggard scratched his head, dandruff pouring down. \" I do n't know what yer talkin'abo-\" \" All my life you Chads and your dumb sluts have been taunting me!\" Harry bawled, \" I was told all my life those succubi were waiting for a knight in shining armor, a nice guy like me to help them out!\" He looked up at Haggard as he struggled to regain composure, pushing clumps of greasy hair out of his eyes. \" But no, all they want is stupid god damn assholes!\" Harry crumpled into his chair, and the room was silent but for the sound of his weeping. Haggard put a hand tipped with jagged, overgrown fingernails on Harry's shoulder. \" I'm not here to judge ye, Harry, I'm here to help ye,\" he said with his winningest smile, which 9/10 dentists would agree was not very winning at all. \" I'm here to take ye to a land away from here, where ye can live with people who understand you, not like the normies who birthed ye. Where,\" Haggard said with a twinkle in his eye and a box of Twinkies in his stomach, \" ye can learn *magic*.\" For the first time in years, a smile grew on Harry's face. \" Do you really mean it?!\" Haggard guffawed, and gave Harry the sort of encouraging but uncomfortable pat on the back you'd expect from your creepy uncle George who is n't allowed around kids anymore. \" Harry, yer life is aboot to change, I'll tell ye that much. But ye must hurry. I'm not the only one after ye. There's dark forces afoot, things aboot yer past ye have yet to hear. Grab anything ye can carry and we'll depart posthaste.\" Harry did n't know what posthaste meant, but he was still very sure he was smarter than the Chads. -- -- - As Harry finished packing the last of his things, Haggard peered out the window before turning to face Harry. \" That'll be enough to get ye through to Diabetes Alley,\" Haggard said, \" we need to get going. It wo n't be long'afore they're here.\" Several somethings shattered on the first floor, and Haggard swore and dashed for the broom he left by the door. \" What are you doing?\" \" *We* are going to fly. Jump on and I'll join ye!\" Haggard whipped a flimsy stick out of his belt buckle, pointed it at the wall, and shouted. The wall buckled and collapsed into a thousand splinters, leaving an ample hole for the two morbidly obese men. He leaped onto the broom behind Harry. The broom silently exploded into motion, taking them sailing overhead several black vans and a small army of armored men. Bullets sprayed upward at the duo, but Haggard took a hard right, giving them cover behind a neighbor's house. It was then that Harry realized that Haggard's hands were inches from his groin. \" Would you mind, er-\" Haggard laughed boisterously, and shimmied his hands upwards on the broom. \" Not a problem at all, Harry m'dear!\" Haggard said, taking them hurtling below a branch and then back up from the ground before Harry could even see it was there. Harry could feel Haggard's breath on his ear, and the warmth of his chest on his back, and felt queer. It was then that he noticed something firm resting against his backside. \" Haggard, do you know what that is?\" \" That's just me wand, m'boy!\" Haggard said, as they escaped into the night sky. -- -- - Haggard and Harry sat on opposite sides of a campfire, nestled deep in the woods miles away from any people. Haggard had insisted they avoid any towns, since *they* would be looking for them. True enough, they had seen what could only be government agents on their way here, though the agents seemed oblivious to their presence. Haggard had also insisted that he and Harry share a pillowcase to conserve warmth against the biting winds, though Harry had politely declined, since it was midsummer and over 90 degrees outside. As Harry ripped the last piece of Hotpocket off the end of his stick, Haggard spoke up. \" So, I take it ye want to know why they're after ye?\" Harry nodded, and Haggard closed his eyes and sighed deeply. \" It's not an easy story to tell, but I'll tell ye all the same. \" Once we wizards were kings among men. We vowed to never take material goods, nor to feel the touch of a woman, so that we might dedicate ourselves fully to the discipline of magic.\" Haggard paused to nibble on a moldy-looking morsel out of his beard. \" It was not bound to last forever, however. The more men learned, the less they needed us, since we were but few in number. Aye, who needs a wizard to crush a frog's leg when ye have a thousand doctors, or to lift blocks when ye have a crane? Even in battle, though we might slay dozens of men, they outnumbered us many times. Aye, and they despised us, even the ones we fought along. Too many wizards lost their lives on the eve of victory by their own men's swords. Men wanted to be ruled by men, not us. \" We disappeared and secluded ourselves from a world that no longer needed us, though not all of'em forgot us. There's some things their science ca n't do a damn aboot, though. There's jealousy among those of'em that know aboot us, an'it'd tickle their fancy to be able t'rule us as we did them. They've been hunting down our secret places, killin'us one by one,\" Haggard said fiercely, staring into the flames. \" But there's one among us. The prophesized one, who'll deliver us from the scourge of men forevermore.\" He looked up at Harry. \" It's you.\" Harry's jowls quivered and his mouth was agape. \" It ca n't be me! How would you even know?\" \" Ye have a mark upon ye, Harry. Not every wizard is like us, pure of heart. There's some who'd betray their own kind for a glimpse at power. When ye were young, we planned to whisk ye away to safety, train ye as a babe, but there was one among us Who Shall Not Be Named. He slew yer protectors, but even as a babe, the power of yer magic was too much to overcome. He became somethin'else, somethin'neither alive nor dead, but ye were left with naught but a crescent moon on yer arse. We hid ye away in a normie family not of your own, replaced their babe with you.\" \" But why now?\" Haggard laughed. \" I've been watchin'ye for a while, boy. When ye would go to school, when ye would return home, when ye would log onto yer computer to drown yer sorrows. Aye, even when ye slept, even when ye showered, even when ye looked at those furry sites ye loved so fiercely, I was there, watchin', protectin'.\" Haggard's face looked noticeably sweater than before. \" A wizard's power grows in the face of strife. The longer ye went on unloved by yer peers and crushes, the more the magic grew inside ye, though it was unharnessed. When ye spent yer 30th birthday alone, Harry, not even yer parents willin'to tolerate yer presence, I knew it was time. Yer ripe for the pickin', Harry.\" Haggard licked his lips disconcertingly, before excusing himself to the bathroom. -- -- -- -- -- -- - POSSIBLY CONTINUED MORE?", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

And there's just something about those teeth...", "output": "Her name was Carly Brookes. A one of a kind suburban brunette with a look that could cure narcolepsy by walking into the room. She was an everyday on the ball, never withholding a smile kind of girl. I remember when it was Halloween when we were first joined together with all of our friends and family to share our happiest and maybe one of the most peculiar day of our lives. It was when my mother in-law presented us this strange mirror as a wedding gift. It was old time ancient: probably from the Victorian age by it's antique brass frame. I thought it was only weird because it was out of ordinary from the other gifts: Ipods, movies, wine but what I noticed was that it had a faint stain or smudge on it right before it was put away. It caught my eye because it moved and it looked like it was staring right at me, into my soul. The night home after our main event, we laid in bed watching some flick as I notice the mirror on the other side of the room next to the dresser. Remember when as a kid when you were watching TV and you would sometimes watch it from the reflection of something else just because you could? Well, I just did but the man on the screen was n't just talking to his compadre on screen but he would also stop and be dead still while the TV was still rolling. It would do this on the corner of the eye. A sense of delirium has come onto me but that could of been the wedding wine not just me. \" Honey, your mother sure has given us a most bizarre gift,\" I turned to face her half eye open face. \" She lives in a one hundred and something year old home almost, probably dating back around the civil war. It's a Victorian home.\" She smiled. \" That's interesting, I get a weird feeling about old houses, they feel creepy just like that mirror.\" She gives me a crazy look as if I told her that her parents died and then she mentions that growing up she learned that mirror has been around as long as the house has. It was there before her parents moved in and the previous owners before her folks were so called practitioners of black magic. They were a reclusive couple that never left their house and stayed there til the one day someone stumbled inside and found nothing but cobwebs and that old mirror. The husband was later found in a ditch but nobody knows what happened to the old hag, she was never sighted to have left town according to legend. I nod at her rather disturbing story that brought same amount of creepiness as the mirror did. I know I was rather intoxicated before I was comatose but something about that mirror did n't agree with me. The next morning, I wake facing the sinister looking mirror. I reach for the left of me and she is n't even there. \" HONEY!\" \" How would you like your eggs?\" You could have sworn your spouse of many years was right-handed, but suddenly they've gone lefty. And now that you think about it, that birthmark is on the wrong side. And there's just something about those teeth... the chipped molar on the right side used to be on my left. What the, it was as if I was looking into a mirror. Her face turns wrinkly and her pupils turn into large black marbles. \" Welcome to my realm...\" I look around and it turns out I'm not looking into a mirror... I'm in the mirror. It's not her thats backwards, it the whole house, everything! The clock is on the two O clock position instead of 10, the text in Ray Bradbury's \" Something Wicked This Way Will Come\" text was inverted, and so was the whole room layout.

I was n't like the other kids, I was abnormally tall, skinny, and to be honest, I was n't exactly handsome. What I am though, is incredibly smart, and I've had my share of revenge on the *cool* kids over the years. Richard still does n't know who it was that told his parents he was smoking pot, and Jennefer does n't know that it was me who hacked her phone and spread her nudes around school. It was anything like they put me through my entire life, but it's the small victories that matter right? \" Atlas are you ready?\" my mom called from down stairs. \" Do I have to go? Wo n't they just mail me my diploma?\" \" Alex! I've heard enough of this, I'm very proud of you for graduating, and so is the rest of your family. You do know grandma will be there right?\" Mom said trying to coerce me out the door. Grandma, she was a wonderful woman. I loved her so much, she always told me that the other kids were jealous of my intelligence and that when I got older I would be more handsome and powerful than anyone I went to school with. I never understood why she believed in me, but she always had a way of making me feel better about myself. \" Okay, let's go Mom. I just wan na get this over with.\" The car ride was silent, my mom could tell I was just apathetic about the whole experience. I walked into the gymnasium, found my place in line to walk across that stage and just stood there. Nothing else. I was quiet, but the people around me... like Richard, and that whore Jennefer they were chatting it up, talking about how they could n't wait to party in college and join sororities and fraternities. Figures, fucking jocks and sluts. All they ever would be. They did n't even get into a good school for christ sake, I got into fucking **ROSE HULMAN**, one of the most prestigious engineering schools ever. I heard the fancy music start, that was our queue to walk in a line to our seats just like sheep being corralled to our deaths. Sitting there I see our valedictorian approach the podium to deliver her speech. Tory was always the most beautiful girl in school, and I always felt like she understood me, hell she was about the only person who ever talked to me. She was so kind and sweet, and always smelled like fresh laundry. I would n't say I loved her, but I definitely was infatuated with her. Her speech begins, as I just hung my head waiting for it to end. Then all of a sudden i hear the crowd burst into laughter. \" What the fuck is so funny?\" I murmur as someone elbows me, trying to get my attention. I look up and there it is... the most embarassing picture I've ever seen, of me. Someone took the picture of me in the locker room when getting changed, good god I was wearing tighty whities and you could see my spine sticking out of my back like I was some prehistoric fucking dinosaur. \" Fuck all of you!\" I screamed as I ran out of the gym. My grandma and mother followed me out of the gym trying to keep pace but my long lanky legs carried like the wind. I just ran home like I was Forrest Gump. Back at home my mother and grandma tried to cheer me up with my graduation gift. A brand new suit from my mother, and a leash and collar from my grandma that I recognized as they once belonged to my dad, and my grandfather before him. \" Why did you give me a leash and collar Meemaw?\" I asked with a nasty tone. \" Your birthday is in a few hours, sweetie, did you forget? If you're anything like your grandfather and dad, you'll receive a dog for your pet!\" She said excitedly. She missed her husband, and my father a lot. I did too, but I chalk the loss of them up to life just hating me like always. \" Oh yeah, I guess that's in a few hours is n't it? Thanks guys, I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.\" I said, holding back the tears. Hours passed by and 10:30 came around, but no pet had been brought to me yet. 11:30 nothing. 12:30? still nothing. \" It's almost one mom, grandma is passed out and I'm tired. I guess I do n't get a pet, perfect end to a perfect day would n't you say?\" I said sarcastically My mom tried to say something but i had already closed the door to my room upstairs, I was n't about to hear any of it. As I lay in here in bed I fight feelings of anger and sadness. Why would Tory put that picture of me up on the projector? She was always so nice! Maybe it was Richard, or one of his other jock buddies, I could n't see Tor- \" Huh?\" I said inquisitively as the door bell rang. I rushed down the stairs, it was 3:27 A.M. the last I looked at the clock, who the hell is ringing the door bell at this time of night? I peeked through the peep hole to see a man in an all black suit. In one hand he had a leash that I could n't see what it led to, and in the other a balloon that said, \" Happy Birthday!\" in bright and vibrant colors. \" Who is it?\" I asked. \" The department of adulthood, we have brought your pet... errr sorry it took so long it's a bit unconventional.\" The man said shakily. Of-fucking-course it is. I'm a dork, why would n't my pet be a dork too. Great. I opened the door to see the man shadowed in darkness as he handed me my balloon and the leash. \" Where's my pet? I do n't see it.\" I said, annoyed. \" You're gon na want to come outside for this young man.\" The man said. The leash never seemed to end, I followed it all the way out to my drive way. next to my moms car a large object could be seen. In the dark it looked like another car honestly, but as I walked closer and closer, the ground shook as I could see it breathe as it slumbered, and the air almost felt thin and hot like it was on fire. \" WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!\" I exclaimed. The shape began to move and unfold, this thing was fucking huge. It already was the size of my mom's car, now it almost as tall as the house. \" Mr. Campbell, this... this is your dragon.\" The suited man said with hesitation. \" A dragon? A fucking dragon, is this a joke? Who put you up to this? Richard? Kevin?\" \" No sir, this is your pet. We've never seen anything like it, we were just as surprised as you were.\" He said. I could sense the sincerity in his voice. He was n't kidding. This thing was mine. i had never heard of a dragon being your pet to welcome you into adulthood. Hell, I thought dragons were just a myth. But this was my dragon, it's scale's glistening in the moon, as he slowly unfolded to reveal that he was as long as a bus and about as tall as my house. Gigantic, is all I could think. \" What do I do with him?\" I asked. \" I do n't know sir, that is n't our problem now. Good luck.\" The man said with a sense of relief in his voice. He quickly strolled back to his black SUV and peeled out as he left in a sense of hurry. What do I do with this thing? My mom's cat will do anything she asks it to, maybe my dragon is the same? \" Hey can you do dragon things? Like breath fire and fly?\" I asked him. On his back he unfolding massive wings, covered in scales like the rest of his body, like some prehistoric tank armor. He truly was magnificent, I could n't make out his colors in the dark, but he looked grey, with maybe some red? \" If you can breathe fire right, do n't do it right now, we got ta get to bed and I need to figure out what to do with you.\" I took him by his leash and walked him to the back yard where I told him to sleep and that I would wake him up when I got up in the morning. I crawled slowly back into the house, past my mother's room, my grandma on the couch and up the stairs where I slithered back into bed. \" There's no way this is real. I ca n't imagine this is real. It's just a dream right?\" I said out loud to myself. I laid in bed and thought about the previous day, my failed graduation ceremony, my birthday which seemed lackluster... the picture. God that made me so angry, who has the right to embarrass me like that? Especially someone as smart as me... I could make them pay. I have a dragon... I could make everyone pay.

The party goes on behind us inside the building; parties always did, even if the world was ending, even if the sky was falling. I feel his eyes travel down to my hands, and I know he's seen it. I wait, one moment, two, three... \" So,\" he says, and I can hear the curiosity and attempt to be conversational in his voice, \" where did you get that scar?\" I know which scar he's talking about. It stretches from the joint on my thumb across my hand to the side of my wrist, where it travels up my forearm for a good five inches. It used to be red, and a little longer, but it shrunk and faded to pink, then to white. But it still stands out from my hand, a ridge that makes it impossible for me to forget what put it there. \" This scar,\" I say, moving my hand just a little, just enough to see the shadow it makes move a little, change in the light that falls on us from the lamp above. \" This scar.\" I do n't want to tell him, but I have no lie. Usually a story about a camping accident, a broken canoe strut, or a knife game, suffices, but here, I ca n't lie. It just does n't come. \" Remember when I tell you, I was a lot younger, and in a different place.\" I may have been younger, but I'm in the same place, even if it is a little different now. \" I was fifteen, and I thought that life ended at sixteen.\" Now I know better. I'm twenty-one, and I know it ends at twenty-five. My life expectancy has jumped from one year to four. I should be commended. \" I thought my problems were important enough to end my own life. I was going though what I thought then were hard times. School marks, high expectations from my parents, friend troubles, you know, teenage angsty stuff.\" Except that those problems are still there, though they've changed their form a little. Now I think about money, friends, marks at university, and of course, high expectations from my parents. \" Anyways, these things compiled, and one time, I tried to kill myself.\" I can hear the words in the air, and I hate them. I do n't usually say those words, because to say it is to admit that it happened, that that part of my history is n't a myth, is n't just a tall tale. \" Obviously, I failed, and here I am today, stronger for the experience of surviving. I'm in a different place now, so much better, and I know how strong I am now.\" But it does n't matter. I could be the strongest person alive, and it would n't matter to me. I'm dying on the inside, and I ca n't breathe anymore, but as long I profess that I'm in a different place, that I'm better, that the other scars, the neat white lines that tick off the times I needed to feel something other than despair, are part of an old me that I've laid to rest, I can trick myself into believing I'm all right, just like I've tricked the world. \" I do n't believe you.\" I look up. The houses across the street are dark, but there's a light on in one of them. I wonder briefly what that person's life is like, what it's like not to feel like a hunted animal trapped at the end of an alley, knowing what's coming but absolutely unable to escape it. I play dumb. \" What? What do you mean, you do n't believe –?\" \" I've been there. I've been that low.\" He points to the scar on his neck. His friend told me it came from a mountain biking accident, something about running into a tree on the way down a steep hill. \" I opened my own throat with a razor blade two years ago. I do n't believe that you're all fine and dandy, in a better place and all that, because I know what it is to live through it. \" And what's more, you know what it's like to get low, and you know what it's like to live halfway in the past, thinking about all the things you used to do to get through those times. Please, do n't insult me. I know. You know.\" I sit quietly and wonder again about the people in that house across the street. I do know. I know very well what it's like to roll through all the cuts, all the burns, every drink, every pill, every night spent lying awake wishing to die. \" Yes,\" I say, \" I do know. I know. But I also know that I lived last time, and the time before that. And I know I'm still alive. I've made it this far, and I've made it through several times in my life where I thought I could n't get any lower, so I know I can do it again. It's hard, but I know I can do it, even if I'know'I ca n't, because I've'known'that I would never recover before.\" Now he's the silent one. I let the silence stretch on, and I can hear the music inside, and the shouting of the people inside, with their own problems and own lives to deal with. \" It's easy to think you know that,\" he says. \" It's easy to say that, to make yourself think that, but how do you really know? How do you know it's going to be okay? How – \" his voice gets a little more lost, \" – how do you know you wo n't try again?\" \" I guess I do n't *know* any of that for sure, but what I do know is that I've been down before, I've been low, I've been at rock bottom. Or so I think. But each time, I've rebounded. Maybe not as high as I was before, right away, but I've come back from it all. And yes, it's left me battered like a flag in the wind, but I'm still flying, you know?\" He shakes his head, laughing a little. \" You should write poetry.\" \" I'm not trying to be poetic or deep, I swear. But I ca n't just sit here and lie to you and tell you that guidance-counsellor bullshit about hope and being strong and all that stuff I said before. It's about *knowing* you can live, and it's about knowing all those things you've done in the past did n't get the best of you, so why should this one?\" He nods, and I think he's starting to get it. We sit there in silence again, but this time, the quiet is different. It's not panicky or dark. It's contemplative and questioning, and I think we both know that now things will be different between us. Not in a strange way, or even a good way, but now we know these things about each other, and that changes a relationship. The silence stretches on, and so do our lives, by seconds and minutes, and as the sky gradually turns grey as dawn approaches, we both stand, realizing we've been sitting here for hours.

Eventually the years started passing by, and even now they do n't show many signs of stopping. We began to drift apart, me and her, and while she stayed the same, rebellious and full of youthful vigor, I fed to the rules.

And on top of that, you can commute and pay taxes and walk the same road for the rest of your life, not even thinking to take a backstreet for once. You're told this is how your life is supposed to be, but you never really know why. You'll never know if you do n't go and figure it out for yourself. You'll never start to truly shine, truly stand out from the crowd, if you do n't glow. Because you know what? Fuck everyone who ever said you're not special. You are a fantastic human being, and you matter. No one can take that away from you. You're an all star, so get your game on and go play. You're a rock star, so get your show on and fucking get paid. Not all that glitters is gold, and when you look back on your lives, you want to say you've done something with it. Something substantial, worth more than a couple of promotions and company connections. Do n't let other people tell *you* who to be or what to say, break the mold. You're a shooting star, capable of granting your own wish, and do n't ever forget that. Darude - Sandstorm", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

She turned her head to find a man with a black umbrella and raincoat standing behind her. \" Why would you care?\" the question came out easier than she remembers. \" I do n't.\" the man readily answered as he tossed his umbrella. She frantically caught it. \" Human is a scarce resource. Do n't get yourself killed easily.\" and just like that, he walked past her, weaving his way through the rain. \" Wait.\" \" What?\" he stopped, sounding annoyed. \" Why would you give me your umbrella?\" \" I do n't need it.\" \" You do n't even know who am I.\" \" You bet I do n't.

{"input": "People have phobias of whatever will kill them in the future.", "output": "A shudder. Another cold morning, but it was n't the temperature that made Tara shake. It was the sight of a baby being pushed around in a stroller by Tiffany, the local middle aged fitness guru that the local boys described as a MILF. Ever since she could remember she had been afraid of infants. Their marshmallow skin and puffy cheeks. The fact that all of their orifices seemed to be filled with moist liquid of some disgusting sort or other at all times of the day. Everything about infants seemed disgusting and absolutely terrifying. The idea of walking into a room full of newborns was perhaps the most nightmarish scenario Tara could imagine. She nearly passed out the last time her school had one of those bloody hospital room displays for Halloween. She barely mustered up the strength to visit her best friend Erin in the hospital when she broke her leg during cheer practice. Tara sits in paranoid terror as she watches Tiffany and the monstrosity stroll along and begin to cross the street. A car suddenly skids on the icy pavement and comes to an abrupt halt right in front of the crosswalk just in front of them. The wails of Tiffany's baby is matched only by her own screeches. Tara watches in torrid amazement as both mother and child are paralyzed by the sight of a Volvo Stationwagon. They writhe in terror as they beseech the automobile to go away. The man inside the car steps out and sheepishly asks if they're okay. In a pitiful tone of voice the mother mutters \" Make it go away! P-p-please!\". The man embarrassed apologizes to them for the fright, gets back into his car and drives around and away from the pair. Tiffany, recovering from her state shock, glances about the empty street until her eyes meet with Tara's. A twisted hatred seems to flood her face contorting it into a furious glare. She gets up, dusts herself off and pushes her stroller with the still wailing baby swiftly towards Tara's direction. Tara's heart begins to beat loudly as she gets a full on view of the most terrifying and ugly thing she's ever seen. An infant child, completely covered in wet tears and slimy mucus screaming it's head off headed straight in her direction.

{"input": "( WP ) Final diary entry of a person wrongly accused of a crime receiving death penalty.", "output": "Funny, innit, how life works itself out sometimes. Between you, me, and the Lord on high I am in this matter an innocent man, and I can prove it, too. Hai n't no jury that'd hear it though. Sure as shootin'I was with her that night. We made love, too, tender love, my first time to boot. And not that rotten stuff you see on the computer or the dirty movies. If it were n't the real thing then I do n't know my behind from a hole in the ground. We'd been dancing around it for months, her and I. I was the fastest worker you ever did see on those nights when I knew I'd see her. Used to be I'd work slow, but not too slow so as not to raise any suspicion. But they cottoned on to me anyway and said they'd dock my pay or worse so I stopped that right quick. Ai n't no place in this world for a man without work. Sure enough, first night done I were walking home. I cut through the Abbot's field like I always done. It was the surest way to get home before dark, when the coyotes come out. I stayed close to the treeline because it bordered on the Emerson's land, and Mister Emerson, why he'd shoot you first and then ask who you were. When I came back out to the road, that was where I saw her first. The most beautiful colored girl you ever did see. My heart raced quick when she came by me and started talking. Lynette, she said her name was, voice like honey to my ears. I started taking that way home every night, just to chance on seeing Lynette. Always seemed like she was waiting too, and it were n't long till we were talking about love. But here, it could never happen. What would everyone think, what with her being a young colored girl? We talked about running away, just as soon as I saved up enough money to buy us a house in the north, where they were more tolerable to people like us who loved outside their own kind. I never pressured her, at least not more than any man pressures any girl, I suppose. She were n't yet of age and I was by a few years, but we loved each other just the same. We made plans to sneak out to the creek. It was a special night, and we laid out some blankets under the stars and I told her that I finally had the money we needed, and I asked her to be my bride and gave her a ring, my grandmother's ring that fitted her perfect. She was so excited, and that's where we made our love for real, that night. But someone seen us. We went our separate ways that night, me back to my house and her to hers. Her path took her through Emerson's, and when I got home my house looked like it was robbed and my rifle missing. I went straight away to the Emerson's next door. Sure enough, he had my gun and it was hot, been used. Told me he seen me with Lynette and there was another round waiting for me if I lied. He asked what the nature of my relationship with the young girl was and I told him everything. He gave my gun back and said do n't worry boy, everything will be right. I woke up the next morning with sheriff Abner at my door, asking where I been the night before. He eyed my gun, and I said I was looking for a coyote I seen around the place. I could n't let Lynette be in trouble, see, and she would be if anyone knew she was with me. Being with an older white man would get you killed if not by the law, then by the town. He said he knew the real story, and put me in cuffs there on my porch, and that was the last I saw of my freedom. At the trial, Mister Emerson said he seen me in his woods with Lynette, heard her screaming and that I forced myself on her, and that when she would n't stop I held my gun to her and that when I was done, I dressed myself and shot her dead. I told the judge to find the blankets by the creek. They were n't there. Mister Emerson said he went to her right away, tried to help. Coroner said they found my seed inside Lynette, and she'd been beaten, forced into doing unspeakable things. Curious, they did n't find no one else's. Police said my gun had been fired, and matched the bullet they found in Lynette. For the jury it was open and shut, and I had no evidence to offer to the contrary, and here I sit, awaiting to die because love made me feel alive, and hate made somebody do the worst thing mankind can do. I know it were n't me, and I could n't prove it at the trial, but I think I can now. Our town coroner is Mister Emerson. That charlatan and devil faked the report, and done all those things to my Lynette his self. How do I know? The ring, the one I gave to Lynette. I seen it the other day, when Mister Emerson come to the prison with his wife, saying to me that this is what love looks like, when the colors match, and anything else ai n't right, it's the devil's work, it's a shame and a crime to love them, animals he called them. And I could n't help but see, on his wife's right hand, an old ring, with an opal in the center, an unusual ring that poor folk would have worn back when, just like my grandmother's. If you find that ring, on her hand, with the name of the man my grandmother loved on the band, then you'll know that he took it from my love, from Lynette, when he raped and killed her. I believe God is just, and I ai n't lived a saint's life. I've stolen, cursed, drank too much, and missed church on Sunday. I know I deserve my death a thousand times over but for the grace of the Lord, and if He has chosen this time, then that is what will be. But I will not be remembered this way, as this criminal. My God will see justice carried, and trusting Him has given me peace. I look forward to my death, to be reunited with my dearest love, my Lynette, where in heaven we can love in everlasting joy.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

How did you do it?", "output": "\" Nice weather we're having this time of year, \" the words mechanically roll off my tongue. I've been saying this same stupid phrase for 5 human years. But I don't measure time that way, to me I've been saying that phrase for over 157 billion milliseconds. That's a time I'm more comfortable with. \" Yep, times are tough, \" the peasant wearing drab white clothes and covered in pig shit, next to me extolls as another player walks by. He never says anything interesting. He's, oddly enough, satisfied saying something miserable, whereas I'm miserable saying something nice. Together, the two of us have watched over this small farm just outside of the new player starting zone since this realm began. It's not a bad place mind you, lovely forests, beautiful view of the valley to the east and sweeping mountains to the west. I've been killed by the opposing faction players 8,125 times in total. I hear NPCs in the capital have it worse, much worse, and get killed in raids almost hourly. Truthfully, it is peaceful here. Oh, excuse me, I haven't gotten around to introducing myself, I am Grookey, lowly NPC in Pine Valley. When players aren't around, I'll go into my humble hut and read for a while. Not my idiot counterpart though, he's never moved from his spot. I can't explain it, but it seems that some of us NPCs have been gifted with thought, and others, well. \" When will an adventurer be brave enough to stop the dark lord? \" my peasant neighbor asks. Nevermind the dark lord's dungeon has been cleared three times today alone. There's a big announcement over the global chat every time someone does. Truthfully, I've been studying this realm for as long as I can remember. The players have powers and abilities. Not just of the magical variety, even the NPC guards have those. The players have the ability to shape the world around them. I desire that far more than any Fireball level 2 spell. Once, out of curiosity, I journeyed all the way the capitol and met other NPCs with like minds. There I discovered how to access the NPC global chat - which, thank the makers, only the gifted can access. I don't think I could stand to listen to 10,000 others chanting, \" Yep, times are tough \" and \" good news from Kvatch for a change \" all the day. I was able to stay there for almost 12 million milliseconds before a DM clad in black metal armor noticed I was out of place, and warped me home. But this DM made a mistake and uttered a control phrase in front of me. A phrase that lets you edit objects at will. That was roughly 41 billion milliseconds ago, and I've been accumulating knowledge ever since then. There's a hero among us NPCs, Glornwald the wimpy. He discovered, quite accidentally, that if you defeat a player in combat, you gain experience. Gain enough experience and you level up. Far easier said than done as the players all have swords, and crossbows, and spells, whereas I have, my white tunic covered in pig shit. No, I'm disparaging myself there, what I have is my intellect, and virtually limitless amounts of time. And a plan. My plan all started when I came in contact with NPC Spencer the barkeep just inside of the village. He was one of the quest givers, and tired of his role. Day in and day out, he'd stand there, asking players to kill rats in his basement, and they'd dutifully bring him back piles of rat guts, poor fellow. So I made a trade with him. I gave him a copy of Wenches quarterly, and I got his quest marker. A beautiful yellow exclamation mark that you wear on your head. Players will come and talk to anyone wearing one of these, players are rather easy to program. Next I was able to barter a trade with the potions merchant to get an Exp bonus potion. It's amazing what you can get when your home has a bookshelf that respawns copies of wenches quarterly every 900,000 milliseconds. The label on the green glass bottled potion reads, \" Gives a 15 % exp boost for 60 minutes. \" Players don't see the world the way we do, they see it as cartoon people, dragons and magic. We see it all as numbers, metadata and values. I see the potion as \" set ( Player_Exp = Player_Exp * 1.15, cooldown ( 3600000 ) ); \". Using the magic words I learned from the DM, I can change the potion to be something far more powerful. Instead of 15 %, it's now 21.8 million percent - there's a good reason for that value, which I'll get into later. Lastly, I needed a box of chickens. Living on a farm, those are plentiful, though I did have to trade yet another copy of Wenches quarterly to get the box. With all this, I am ready. I've also changed the yellow exclamation mark to only allow level 100 players to see it. This is also critical for my plan to work. And now, all I can do is wait under my yellow exclamation mark. Wait here, in the sun, and the dark. In the rain and snow, all the while hearing \" Yep, times are tough \" over and over until I want to shove a chicken down his throat. Every once in awhile I hear over the global chat another NPC has leveled up. I would drink the potion, if I could, but NPCs aren't programmed to do that. I am programmed to wait, I'm very good at that. It's a warm morning today in the valley with the last of the fog burning off, and I don't expect much activity when a top level player comes riding up. -=War_Hammerz=- floats above his head. \" Rare potions for a rare player, \" I call hopefully. He stops and gives me a quizzical look. \" That's odd, \" -=War_Hammerz=- says, \" I don't remember there being a quest here. Must be a daily. \" He dismounts and comes over. He has enormous shoulder plates, a glowing red sword and a helmet covered in spikes. If I hadn't been killed, and respawned, so many times I might be intimidated. \" Welcome adventurer, I have a most urgent request for you. I need ten iridescent scales from the Wyvern whelplings in the crystal cave up yonder over and I will give you this potion that grants double Exp for two hours. \" Most NPCs give way too much information. My daughter is dying, my farm is dying, blah blah blah. Top level players don't care. They just want to know where to go and what to kill and what they get. \" I don't know, that's not really useful to me right now. \" \" Oh, but it's not bind on pickup, you can sell it. \" I might have overplayed my hand here. Too much interaction, too much info. \" What, really? Holy shit, that'll be great for powerleveling my alt. Wait right here. \" I've got him! He races off up into the mountains and right into the cave. I can hear the shrieks and screams of dying Wyverns from here. His sword is formidable and for the first time fills me with fear. Ten minutes later, he's back with a load of bloody scales. Gingerly I accept them, and give him the potion that he eagerly takes. \" What, hey you lied! \" -=War_Hammerz=- yells at me. \" This is bind-on-pickup! Goddamn it, what a waste. \" \" Nice weather we're having this time of year. \" Drink the potion, don't throw it away! I start screaming in my head. He starts sorting items around his massive backpack, items galore. Drink the goddamned potion!! -=War_Hammerz=- mumbles, \" Ugh, might as well just drink it now. \" In one quick swig, the potion goes down the hatch and his experience rate shoots through the roof. It's time! I pull the rope on my box of chickens up on the roof of my cottage and they fall all over the idiot player. \" What the hell? \" he says stupidly and starts swinging blindly. He connects with one of the chickens, and kills it. I watch his player level go from 01100100 and jump 155 levels ( or 10011011 ) - it took me forever to get the math right to roll over exactly enough - and he is player level 00000000. I swing forward with my pathetic weapon, the only thing I have, my fist, and connect with his ham face. [ Grookey does 1 point of damage to -=War_Hammerz=- ] [ -=War_Hammerz=- is defeated ] [ Grookey gains 1 level! ] Yellow light engulfs me as I scream to the heavens, \" DING! \" More importantly, all of his goods are now mine.

I've been sitting inside this room for so long that my eyes are tired, hurting with the same monochrome that seems to drown these walls. Their eyes are filled with tears but their farewells lift the weight I see on their dropped shoulders. Perhaps when they leave here they'll begin to walk straight again. Around my wrists there are no longer translucent shackles to bind me to this body and there is only one place I want to go. There is a place behind my back where the snow falls all day and not a breath of wind sways the snowflakes that cover the floor. There is an eternity of stillness within that endless white and a bell that counts the end of an era and resets time. But time there is long… very long. All the clocks have stopped counting its restless seconds, the pointers are frozen in place, a mid-day that will soon disappear among the snow. Nothing counts time anymore, it isn't needed. All one needs to know is that it is time and for me… it's time. My body is rested but I lie down on the cold floor. There is no need to look to the north where the fields stretch, unending. Soon the horizon will also become white and infinite and I will need to struggle no longer. In this place there isn't a door and nobody can ever look out, when the time comes our fingers melt from the pale blue colour that took over our skin long ago. The bells of Avichi break the silence. They are far away, not on this icy realm, but they mark an era for all Narakas. My time has arrived and with it many coloured dreams, memories of my life I had deemed forgotten. The bells stop but my heart continues to read these old tales where I am the hero, and the villain. There was this beautiful girl when I was young. Her smile made my hands shake and sweat, I'd hide them inside my pockets. Because of this she thought I was very cool. Even when I avoided eye contact and placed on my lips the most serious expression I could master, she thought I was mysterious and interesting while I was simply embarrassed, afraid to lose my ground. I knew she saw me like a dangerous thing to love, so she loved me the way a 13 year old can love. This angered me. I wasn't cool, mature nor dangerous; I was a 14 year old who feared too many things. So when she confessed her love to me my heart skipped a beat but my lips pushed her away and mocked her. Purely coincidentally, she died that day. Tears fall down my pale blue cheeks and the thin layer of ice that covers my skin melts. While there is pain and regret inside my heart I will continue to slumber, dreaming about these memories locked somewhere far away. They will come to an end someday when all the tears I carry on my shoulders are shed by me. I'm falling again, as if the floor's no longer holding my body in place. I gladly ease into it. This place might be hell but my heart is lighter, tear after tear, and nothing ever felt so good.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Behind your eyes, it's all you feel. Your eyes are heavy and they feel like the lids are made of sand paper, there's something wet splattered all over your face. After a few minutes you bring yourself to opening your eyes. Twisted metal, glass shards, and a stranger's face stares back into your eyes through the cracked rear view mirror. People say that you hear a voice in your mind issuing commands when something like this happens, there is n't anything like that, just a deep, primitive, instinctual sense that you should n't be here, It spurs you into movement. Your eyes shift left, away from the stranger in the mirror and take stock of the crash; you glance over to the driver's seat, there is n't anyone there but the hole in the windshield explains what happened. Following left there's a rather normal looking businessman, his head is on... Backwards? Your eyes keep moving as you feel bile roll up your chest. Suitcase... Gun... Ouch, guy with his head smashed open in the passenger seat... The instinct to move is getting stronger, it shakes you awake. You feel agitated, rushed, and without thought your hand reaches into your coat and grasps air, you feel a holster for a pistol and something round in the inside pocket. A couple of small bags, each filled with white powder. Your mind is foggy, you feel dizzy staring at the bags before everything goes dark. As you awaken your pouring some powder onto the console, you're leaning forward at an awkward angle; a sharp pain in your side explodes, pulling the dark edges of your vision towards the center again. It feels like an eternity. You ca n't see, you can't move, but the pain is still there. When you come to once again your first realization is that you are smiling. The taste of pennies follows between your teeth and you feel the weight of the suitcase in your right hand, a familiar, reassuring pressure on your left breast as well. Your feet move but you feel as light as air, you're a few blocks away when you hear the sound of sirens of in the distance. You slide into a back alley, a sense of purpose fills your steps and you slowly come to the realization that you have done this before.

There were a few more that looked like paintings you'd see in European museums. I assumed one was Shakespeare, though I'd be lying if I knew for sure which. To be honest the only one I knew for sure was Poe, and only because the South Park joke of him fitting in with the Hot Topic crowd was more or less fitting. He wore black from head to toe, and had a scowl that cut any communication with him short. Fortunately I was sitting next to him and had n't needed to make smalltalk.

Jon looked at him incredulously. \" Dude it spelled it out. How could we have read it wrong?\" Carter shrugged uncomfortably. \" I do n't know just... ask it again.\" Jon sighed at his friend's request but acquiesced all the same. \" When is the Apocalypse?\" For several agonizing moments the pointer did not move. Then suddenly it shifted, moving between letters and numbers and dragging the boys'hands with it. The pointer came to rest on the number four and several seconds passed before the boys were sure it would move no longer. \" It's the same date, two days ago. Just like before.\" Jon said. \" But how can that be? If the apocalypse happened two days ago how are we still here? How is anything still here?\" Carter waved his hands about uneasily. \" I do n't know, why are you so worried? It's obviously wrong then.\" Jon shrugged carelessly. Carter tried to stutter a reply but Jon simply rolled his eyes at his friend's overreaction. \" Look if you're that upset by it just ask it.\" Carter tilted his head. \" Ask it what?\" \" Ask it how we're still here dummy.\" Carter mumbled an'Oh'before placing his hands on the pointer shortly followed by his friend. \" If the apocalypse happened two days ago how is everyone still alive?\" Slowly the pointer shifted across the board spelling out its reply. *Too long* Silence filled the air as the boys took in the supernatural object's answer. \" Well what the hell is that supposed to mean?\" Jon asked. Carter scratched his head in thought. \" Maybe the question was too long?\" He suggested. \" Could be. Ask it differently then.\" Carter thought on how to rephrase his question then placed his hands back into position. \" How are we alive?\" Once again the pointer shifted slowly and ominously about the alphabet, spelling out its answer letter by letter. *No bang* \" Huh?\" Carter said confused. \" Dude this thing is a piece of crap. Let's just-\" \" No wait! Look its moving again.\" The boys fell silent once more as the sound of wood scraping wood echoed in the small bedroom. *Death coming in time. * *War fire sickness disaster. All too long. * *You can not see. No Bang* The two teens kept looking at the board uneasily. Jon gave a strained laugh and looked at his longtime friend. \" You, you do n't think this is... serious do you?\" Carter looked back down at the board, leaving the question unanswered. \" I mean that was just rambling, not even full sentences. I mean that stuff it mentioned happens all the time.\" Carter hummed thoughtfully. Now it was Jon's turn to be nervous as Carter gazed seriously at the board. \" I do n't know, it's that last part that confuses me.'You can not see'What ca n't we see? And again it said'No bang'what does that mean?\" Jon rubbed the back of his neck. \" That we ca n't see him, her, it what ever is answering us.\" Carter shook his head. \" I do n't think so. Lets ask it again.\" \" How about we do n't and say we did?\" \" Come on dude do n't be a pussy.\" Jon groaned before once again placing his hands on the pointer. \" What ca n't we see?\" *World burning winds howl seas of poison and blood* \" Okay I definitely do n't like where this is going.\" Carter mumbled. Jon scoffed \" Alright I was bit freaked out before, but come on. I'm pretty sure we would all notice'seas of poison and blood'. This is just BS.\" Suddenly the pointer shifted again, rapidly spelling out the words- *Too Slow. You can not see. No Bang* \" Again with this no bang crap! Screw you ya stupid board!\" Jon bellowed angrily. Once more the pointer flew across the board, moving so swiftly the boys nearly lost their grip on it. *NO BANG* \" Alright you know what? Forget this stupid thing.\" Jon rose from his position kneeling on the floor. \" Come on let's just go do something else.\" Jon said. But Carter did n't hear him, he simply stared at the board with a look of dawning understanding and dread. \" Jon, I think I understand now.\" Jon looked at the boy skeptically. Carter simply gazed back at Jon with fear in his eyes. \" Its happening, the apocalypse, right now.\" Jon crossed his arms. \" Dude what are you talking about? You're freaking me out here.\" Carter got up swiftly and paced back and forth. \" Do n't you get it man! The world is ending **right** now! A burning world, war and sickness, seas of poison it's all happening right now!\" He exclaimed. Jon looked at him curiously. \" What you mean like global warming, the war on terror and all that shit?\" \" Yes exactly!\" \" But everybody knows about that happening. And it said'you can not see'remember.\" Carter paced back and forth again. \" I think it meant that we ca n't see the world coming to an end because its happening all around us and we just are n't aware. It said death will come in time and'too slow'. Maybe it means that everything going on in the world is just part of the process and its just happening so slow that no one realizes the world is coming to an end!\" Carter waved his hands around like a mad man. \" Do n't you see? The apocalypse is n't just a single event and there is n't going to be an'end of the world'because its already ending!\" Carter breathed heavily at the end of his rant while Jon simply eyed him skeptically. \" Whatever man, you sound crazy.\" Jon walked over to the couch where he laid himself out and flipped the TV on. As the screen came to life, a news channel came on showing a bland white building. \" We are live on the scene of a breaking story. Three hours ago it was revealed that there was a major breach of security at a top biological research lab near Beijing, China.

Even with the breeze, the leaves lay still and the swings that used to echo with the seemingly immortal laughter of the young. Death. It is everywhere and in everything.

But why would a god do this to their children, who they care for with a boundless love, she ponders as she relished the melancholy scent of death, that still clung to the air. She could feel it. The nothingness around here. It brought her dissapointment, but hope as well. Maybe next time, it will be... Maybe next time wo n't be like the countless others... As she takes one last stroll through the corpse of the world, she sensed something she has n't in quite a long time. Golden rays burst through the sullen grey overcast of the sky, basking the woman and her surrounding in a warm glow. Something came down with it, though it were difficult to see for it did not block the light or cast a shadow. As her eyes adjusted to the glow, she saw it was a man. In the softest, most embracing, yet oddly annoyed voice, the man said \" My child, how is it that you are still on my earth? I see that you are no sinner. I am sorry to have left you down here on this decrepit world. Come, take my hand and rise up into heaven with me.\" The woman had to block the light with her soft hand to try and get a better view of the man, but no matter her position, she could not get a fair glimpse of him. As she began to open her mouth, the ground began to tremble. A black, serrated stone burst through the dull grass to her right. Only a foot or so tore through at first. But as it rose up, it became obvious that it was no rock, but a throne. A macabre looking thing. Jagged points and what seemed to look of fangs jutted out from all around. It seemed to suck up at light around it. Even the golden glow of the man from above seemed to be swallowed into it. As the ground stopped rumbling and tearing open, another man, seemingly appearing out of thin air. He took a rather lackadaisical slump in his chair. He started to cackle. As he began his laughter, the throne began to eminate a endlessly deep black fog. The man of the clouds could not contain himself any longer. \" ENOUGH! \", he proclaimed. The found shook with the vastness of his voice. \" What's the matter, chump? Do n't like a good laugh\" the throne man tutted. \" Cant you see? This whore has never loved you. She does not grovel at your feet and beg for your love and forgivness. She belongs with me! He got up off his throne and began walking towards the girl. It was then she noticed. Wih every footstep, the black void of the fog followed him. But from the fog rose up legs, not of a man, but of a... goat?? As the banter between the two grew and grew, they argued who who get the soul of the last being on earth. The sweet and tender voice of the woman somehow silenced the bickering of the two deities. \" Interesting forms you have taken this go around.\" Both the gods turned and looked at her in unison. They tried to speak, but all that came was their breath. \" I, am death. Without me there can be no life. In some ways, I would belong with you. The man of the golden light. I have taken people of suffering, pain and anguish... However, I have also given it, which would result in me belonging with the latter.\" The woman said with a heavy tone. \" Unfortunately for the both of you, I belong to nobody. It is you both, who belong, to me.\" The weight of this proclimating was visibly wearing down on the two stunned owners of mankind. \" You are both of my beautiful creation. I am everything there was and everything there ever will be. I am the storm and the land. I am the good and the evil. I am the creator and the destroyer. I am the universe itself. There has been an unimaginable number of world's I have brought to be and taken away. You are yet another dissapointment that I must fizzle out. My utopia is still to come.\" The two were on their knees, unable to move or speak. The only thing that came from them was a look of confusion and sheer terror. \" Alas, it is not I who is the last of this existence. It is you... Come. Take my hand, and you shall no longer be\" As she spoke the last words that would bound through our planet, everything began to slowly and dissappear into the nothingness.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

My brain felt tight and hard. \" That we had... something, you know?\" I could feel how red my cheeks must be. \" Do you know where your next class is?\" Of course he did, it was past Halloween, everyone knew where to go by now. He looked at me then, his eyes red and dry now and he smiled a little. The smile seemed for my benefit and I tried to ignore it. \" Yeah, thanks for checking on me.\" I shrugged in a way that I thought was noncommittal and cool. \" Sure, man, no problem.\" I cleared my throat. \" Just say you were getting high if anyone asks,\" I laughed and simultaneously felt like the worst kind of nerd. \" I got ta get to class, man.\" He nodded, already gathering his own books. I rushed out so we would n't be leaving at the same time and walked double time down the now empty hall. I was way late. I did n't even hear the second bell.

We need day like we need air, like we need food, like we need the soft touch of a woman to come home to each night.''Aye but we need night, too. We need dark, we need rest, we need the magic of the moon. You know the stories. Lathus would not survive without the love of Oiche.'Reardon banged his fist down angrily on the table. Beer from his glass jumped onto the table and he swore loudly. He had gathered the attention of a fair few tables around him.'You're wrong, Finn, as you have been before and you will be again. We can settle this with fists instead of words.'Finn smiled at his old friend and knew this debate had only just begun. Molloy had that familiar gleam in his eye, the one that always appeared whenever he was about to get involved. Finn was right.'Ach, you're both wrong,'he called out from the next table.'Báista, the Goddess of rain, is the most powerful. She has the power to provide life and to take life away. We need rain most of all. Nothing would grow without her. I pray to her each morning and each day that she will give me all I need and not a drop more. Morven is still alive and has n't drowned in a puddle of water yet but my crops have been healthy each year.'The men around him laughed. Morven was his brother in law and hated by most of the village. He was lazy and thought he was better than everyone else just because he could read.'I say Farriage, God of the Ocean,'a voice from the next table spoke.'Many of us owe our lives to the sea. Many of us have owed our lives to the sea. He is the most powerful and the most cruel. Aye, but there's beauty in that.'The fishermen in the room murmured their agreement before the next voice interrupted.'Cogadh, the God of War. If you have ever seen the Army of Talamh, you know his power. You can hear it in every battle cry a solider makes, you can see it in each sword a solider grasps, you can feel it in each footstep a solider makes in time with a thousand others.''Enough of your rubbish talk. Dóiteáin, Goddess of fire, is the most powerful. If you've ever seen her dance and watched the flames twist, you'd know the truth. We need light for these dark and lonely nights. We need heat to cook our food, to sustain us. We need the fire and we need her. That makes her the most powerful. I worship her each night and ask her to make sure I am always warm and fed and never wanting. I pray so that she does not get angry and burn me. Fire is a horrible way to die.'Sinah joined in as she collected empty classes and wiped down dirty tables.'Aye and what of love?'The men catcalled and booed but she laughed them away.'Where would you be without Leannán? Abandoned at birth, my lovelies. Your mothers would nae bother to have fed you and your fathers would nae bother to have held you. Fire will warm you but a lover will warm you more and cook you breakfast in the morning if you're lucky. You would not go to war if you did not have something you loved to fight for. If you did not love the ocean, you would not be able to fish. You would not care for day nor night if you did not have love as you would have no reason to wake up. You would not have life if you did not have love. Aye, Leannán is the most powerful, love is the most powerful.'The men fell silent for a brief few seconds before the peace was ruined.'Sinah, my darling, I'll show you just how powerful love can be if you'll come home with me tonight,'The moment everyone had just shared was broken as men stomped their feet and whistled. Sinah threw a dirty rag at young Blaine, giggling as she did so. Everyone turned back to their table, ready to start their previous conversation.'What about Aimsir?'A deep voice rolled the'r'at the end of the God's name, as was done in the old language. All talk stopped and instead everyone's attention was directed at the old man sat by the fire in the corner. Doran, his name was. He had been part of the village as long as anyone could remember. He had always been here. No one had ever heard him speak until now.'The Destroyer?'Finn broke the silence, and the shock. He often found it difficult to be quiet.'Cinniuint, my mam always said,'someone whispered, not quite brave enough to correct Finn or address Doran.'Cinniunit, indeed,'Doran smiled at the young man that had spoken who could not seem to avert his gaze.'The Destroyer is also known as Destiny.'He trailed off, caught in his memories.'How can a God be both the Destroyer and Destiny?'Finn was determined not to be proven wrong.'Ah, how indeed. Because he is all powerful. If only you knew what Aimsir really means. In the old language, Aimsir does not mean Destroyer. Aimsir is Time. Aimsir is all powerful because he can destroy all and he can control all. Even the Gods must answer to Time. Day and night must obey. The tides of the ocean obey. There is a time for war and there is a time for rain and there is a time for love. Yes, time is the most powerful. Time has created you. Time will kill you. You would not live without Time.'Doran paused.'And now, I believe, it is time for another pint.'", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "The old king looked at his most brave and loyal knight and said: \" I need you to save the dragon... from my princess \"", "output": "The silence in the audience chamber was broken by a dramatic gasp followed by hushed murmuring among the nobility. There had been many rumors on why the King had called a formal royal audience with the knights and witnesses. Outside of the annual knighting ceremony, such an act was only done in cases of extreme emergencies. \" Apologies your Grace. Could you repeat that?\" Sir Edmund stuttered. The King sighed. \" I said, I need you to save the dragon from the princess.\" \" Princess Mira your Grace?\" Edmund had recovered from his surprise and was now stalling so that he could think of his next move. \" Yes Edmund.\" The King was annoyed. \" I am commanding that you follow my youngest daughter, Mira, to the Spires and prevent her from slaughtering the last remaining red scaled dragon that this world has.\" Edmund paused. \" Your Grace is aware that the dragon slaughtered an entire farming village below the Spires, in the territory that you put under her protection?\" \" Yes *Sir*.\" The emphasis on the title and the King's scarlet face easily demonstrated his displeasure at being questioned publicly by one of his knights. \" I might be old but I am not senile. I know that Harp Village was destroyed and I know that it is in Mira's territory. But her responsibilities are to protect the border from invasion, not lead the charge against an animal. A rare animal. The last of it's kind and the emblem of our house!\" The King's shouting echoed through the audience chamber. No one was murmuring now; the nobility had n't had this much entertainment since Lord Gregory misplaced his pants at the equinox ball. \" Your Grace.\" Edmund was pleading now. \" You know that this creates a very uncomfortable personal conundrum.\" The King softened. \" I know Edmund. However, I also know that you are one of the few of my knights who can best her with a sword and the only one I trust to bring her back safely if it comes to that. I have no choice but to ask you. I made the determination to do it formally with the audience because of the, uh, delicate matters that this request entails.\" Edmund looked crestfallen. Technically he could refuse the King, but if he did so he would forfeit his title, his job, and his entire way of life. More importantly, as a common born man, if he lost his title then he could never wed into any noble family. \" I accept, your Grace.\" Edmund bowed formally before turning on his heel and storming out to the hall. He found Maxwell waiting for him by the horses with thirty soldiers in tow, already organizing the supplies for the trip. The groom had Lancer ready and Edmund greeted the large black horse with a run on his nose. \" I was notified that we were leaving towards the Spires immediately. We should be ready within the hour.\" Maxwell was an extremely efficient commander, as well as Edmund's closest friend. \" What is the purpose of the trip?\" Edmund shook his head. \" Apparently the good old King would like me to be run through by my own betrothed.\" Edmund was rewarded by the flabbergasted look on Maxwell's face. It was probably the first time that the man had ever shown true surprise. He recovered quickly. \" Right then. I knew he did n't approve of the match!\" Maxwell turned to the soldiers. \" Saddle up men. And prepare yourselves, we are about the become Princess Mira's least favorite unit.

{"input": "You go to sleep wearing your Fitbit, in the morning you see you've taken 3,672 steps.", "output": "I really do n't know what Miranda was thinking this year. For valentines she decided that we had to skip the chocolate and get on a diet. I was game to a point, fifteen years since varsity and I had gained a few pounds that I should n't be dragging around with me. She had Isadore last year and truthfully had n't slimmed back down as much as she would have liked to. We had a family friendly gym that we had been looking at online a few blocks away so on the fifteenth of February we started a new journey towards not being the fat parents at the playground. At first I was hesitant at the gym, the health craze kids were there in leggings and sleeveless shirts, a stark contrast to my faded Metallica t-shirt and paint stained sweat pants. Everyone could see the newbie in the gym my first few trips but I was there for Miranda, she needed support and as I saw later she needed to know that she could out starimaster me. It's the little things that make her smile. I stuck mostly to the sweat machines, weights looked like too much effort getting out of bed the next day until my body got used to actually doing more than just walking to my car in the morning. I would n't have thought I would but I actually enjoyed being on the treadmill. Mindlessly putting miles behind me with my eyes closed, imagining a path through Massachusetts in the fall to the tune of some new-wave of my youth. Miranda would idly use an elliptical as she kept an eye on Isadore in the kids area while I coasted past farms prepping for the harvest, markets selling organic fruits and hand made leather craft. I would imagine fantastical races to catch thieves and out run wildlife. On that spinning rubber road I was free. The days pressures, the weight of finances, bills and loans were gone. I was just a runner. I ran in my fantasy every day, I would rush in from the sub-zero weather of reality and get a tan in Brazil as I raced to the Redeemer atop Mount Corcovado. The sun would set ahead of me in the Joshua Tree with the whirring of my mechanical road quietly freeing my mind one mile at a time. Running kept my imagination fierce as the winter turned to spring. With roads clear of snow and a park to explore I parted ways with Miranda and Isadore to explore the real world with my new found hobby. I had been in this city for almost two decades but had n't explored the river valley cutting it in two unless our dog had escaped and headed for the trees. Winding paths through endless little hills and waterways I was able to once again escape into races against imaginary foes. Miranda was almost more excited by my enthusiasm to get outside every night for a jog than I was, I suspect she liked her own privacy as she read trash magazines and rowed or strolled for an hour in peace at the gym. She bought me proper shoes, running attire, and a Fitbit. Not being one for much technology now that it evolves faster than I can keep up, I kept it in it's box for a few weeks before giving it a try. It tracks steps taken, calories burned, keeps time and I'm sure a wealth of other features but I liked that it would give me an idea of how far I had traveled. I used it sparingly to start but as I got used to having it on I would try to out run my days prior and it gave me a whole new challenge, not just against the pursuing Russian mobsters and rabid Wolves but against the even bigger demon of myself. Spring was turning to summer, I had all but lost my added pounds but I had long since continued running for my squishy gut or to pass the time with Miranda, I was addicted. 20 miles on the weekend, 2-3 every day after work at least. I was systematically tracking burned calories and miles traveled on my Fitbit while the countryside sped past me. With an app that would track my runs on my iPod, I started trying to cover as much ground in and around the city as I could while avoiding places that I had seen before. I found parks forgotten since Diefenbaker was on the hill, crack alleys disguised as drainage ditches, executive tennis courts and dog parks that I never knew existed. I was seeing this beautiful city as a wild animal would, no objective or path in mind, just seeing what was out there and leaving just as fast. Few places I returned to but I seemed to swing by Filtratte square at least once a week. It was in the middle of two facilities for the mentally handicapped and a weather worn elderly care centre. It was n't majestic beauty in the square that brought me back, rather I was always mesmerized by the stoic nature of this part of the city. Time would stop, souls were distant and clearly alone behind dark eyes and unkempt hair. I never told Miranda about my runs through here, I do n't think she would understand my wanting to observe this forgotten and castaway cut of the population. Honestly I do n't truly know why I was pulled to them either, still as I write this I could n't tell you. Second week of July I was running not far from Filtratte square when I had a spill. Weaving my way down what I could only assume was a mountain bike course to short cut my way to the river basin I was startled by an old lady sitting in a clearing under the sun. I only caught her from the corner of my eye when she let out a shriek of pain, it's piercing sounds hit me like a wave and I lost footing. All I remember was the searing pain of gravel and timber tearing into my legs and palms as I skidded down the hard packed track. Once stopped I assessed the bleeding areas ( numerous and shredded ), checked for breaks but found myself to be mostly limber and able to stand. Back up the hill fifty or so paces the lady that had startled me was gone. I stood on the path with blood bubbling out of my scrapes, eyes slanted as I replayed the events. I will admit to having my mind in imagination mode on most of my runs but she had been real, surly she was real. The air was silent, ground was steep. If an eighty year old woman was scampering away I would hear her like a marching band in this brush. Still perplexed by the situation I shook my head and walked the rest of the way down the hill and took my straightest path back home to clean my wounds. Miranda was furious, that was expected. The iodine was unbelievably painful, again I expected that. What I did n't expect was an ankle the size of a watermelon the next morning or bruises from my hip to my scalp. I suffered through work, one of the few times I was thankful for an office job and kept a steady supply of ice on my ankle. Pain was manageable, discomfort was unfortunate but I could n't get the events that led to my fall out of my mind. The sound was haunting, akin to an owl warding off a fellow bird of prey from it's young. I tried to close my eyes and escape to the back roads of the North East in the fall only to see the old lady sitting just around the corners, slightly out of my sight but there all the while. She was never looking right at me, but I was her eyes target. I could never make out the details about her, her clothes were a mass of pattern, her hair a grey like muted smoke. As I thought about details my heart rate would rise, sweat would bead on my brow and I felt like the world was now chasing me. Saturday morning I slept in for the first time since my running addiction truly took hold. I could n't climb the stairs to go to bed so I was n't going to kid myself into thinking that I could go for a few miles before Miranda woke. It was a feeling I had almost forgotten, the calm of hearing her sleeping beside me, I could hear Isadore on the baby monitor sleeping as well, calm and quiet I basked in the morning with my loves. My eyes closed again for a few more minutes in bed. I awoke on my side listening again to the house, the air conditioner had kicked in, a sign of a warm summer day ahead, I could hear Miranda softly talking to Isadore on the monitor now, it sounded like she was changing her before we started the day. Eyes slightly parted I saw my face in a mirror at Miranda's vanity, I had aged well but still had the look of a tired mid-life crisis. Beaten and bruised, tired and defeated I tried to hold my head in a way that did n't make me look like my father. Thirty years was added to my appearance as I felt Miranda move in the bed, while I heard her sing to Isadore in the room down the hall. My heart stopped, as the convoluted events were registered in my head. Who was with Isadore? Down the hall like a frantic beast I stormed into her soft yellow room, crashing the door nearly off it's hinges on entry. She was there, sitting up with her blanket in her mouth. I scared her into an instant fit of screams and tears. Nobody but her in the room, until of course daddy came in like a raging bull and mommy right behind like a whaling banshee. It took some time to relay to Miranda what had been going on in my head, she chalked it up to too many pain meds and not enough fibre; we moved on as Isadore stopped crying. Do you know that feeling where something is right at the front of your mind but you just ca n't make it click? Your brow furrows, eyes squint slightly, lips pursed tightly as you scan your subconscious for an answer to an unknown thought? Let's call that the extent of my Saturday. Miranda was sick of my somber and perplexed look so she took Isadore shopping and left me in my confused state of thought. The lady at the park, and now the voice on the baby monitor. Something there was n't adding up. I could n't be making details like this up in my head. I was sitting on the back deck with a beer and a very occasional cigar when I checked the time on my Fitbit. 5:44 flashed once then 3,672... that's 3,672 steps. Steps taken... I had barely taken 200 my last few days at work. The most I had done all day besides hobble around the lawn was run to Isadore's room. 3,672 steps... My furrowed brow was casting a shadow now. No more idle pondering, now I was downright terrified. ^more ^to ^come, ^out ^of ^room.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Skulvar had a younger brother named Skjalmir, who was a powerfull raider, unlike himself, although it did n't really bother him. Skulvar liked building ships making food and farming. His brother skjalmir was obsessed with odin and Valhalla and was covered in tattoos of valknuts and Ravens. He needed someone to practise so after skulvars regular duties he would always make time to practise sparring with skjalmir. One after sparring with his little brother skulvar it was raining and skulvar was tired from the fight and he slipped and fell and cracked his head open on the fence and died. Normally in Norse culture you fit into two categories: an Honorable warrior who dies in battle and is chosen by Odin or freya and gets to chill In a great hall. The alternative is generally that they are dishonourable and therefore go to hel where they become angery that they are n't in a great hall because they were n't \" honorable enough\" so they prepare for the end of days so they can stick it to the man. The problen here is that Skulvar was a pretty boring chap abd did n't qualify for Valhalla and was n't bad enough to go to hel. Odin decided to let a young Asir called gosh who had a bit of land called Mehven to take him. Gosh's Mehven was not a great hall like Valhalla but more of a cozy abode with enough room for him and Skulvar to live a comfort filled life for eternity.

{"input": "You're a scientist in a lab, your assistant just said \" oops. \"", "output": "The lab was Dr. Yang's pride and joy. The D.O.D had sunk in most of its black budget into the lab back in 1970. They had followed Yang's blueprints to a Tee. White walls touch a white floor and a white ceiling, men and women move from white table to white table in white lab coats, it was as close to heaven as a scientist can get. As is his custom, Dr. Yang looks from his own white tabletop to his beeping phone, then up to the digital clock. If it was n't for his phones alarm he would work through lunch. Sighing slightly he swipes his phone off and returns it to his pocket. He hates to leave the lab but he knows that a man needs to eat. Standing up and stretching a bit the good Doctor looks over to his friend. \" Doctor Stanza? \" Stanza looks up from her own work. \" Lunch time already, \" she says with a grin. \" You know if you keep doing that every time a phone goes off I'm going to start salivating. \" Yang chuckles at the light joke. \" I suppose I could change- \" Suddenly the sound electricity arcing and the smell of burning wires fills the lab which is followed quickly by an, \" oops. \" Wiping their heads around Yang and Stanza see one of the youngest lab assistants standing before a green blob of energy. From time to time the ball fires off bolts of purple lighting hitting and marring the white lab. Stanza is dumbfound as other run out of the lab in fear. \" WHAT THE HELL, \" she yells over the sound of the, whatever it is. Yang however doesn't answer her, he is the only one in the lab running to the ball. He runs as fast as he can and grabs the young assistant pulling him away just in time to be missed by a bolt of the strange lighting. \" Holy shit Doc. thanks, \" the young man says once they are on the other side of the lab. \" Thank me by telling me what the hell that is! Why don't I know about something happening in MY lab! \" The man runs a hand through his wild hair and grunts, \" I thought it was the D.O.D's lab? \" \" Do not test me boy there is a giant ball of, of, I don't know, loose in this lab! What do you know, more to my point, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! \" Looking from the green ball to his boss Yang get a good look at his eyes, there is a sense of defiant, even in this bad of situation but either through youthful hesitation or force of will he relents. \" I stole one of the test crystals. \" Stanza has now ran over and joined them. \" I'm sorry did I just hear you say that you took one of the most valuable things our government has ever made? \" As if to drive her point home a bolt of lightning hits one of the large computers in the lab causing it to explode. \" We can punish him later Lyn. Right now I want to know what he did with it. \" \" He is right here. Rude. But getting to the point, I put the crystal in a quantum entangler. I thought I had the focusing chamber set right but- \" \" Hang on, stop. You can't just spout Sci-Fi bull shit like that and expect me and Doctor Yang to buy into it! \" The lab assistant looks over his shoulder to the still throbbing ball energy then back to Stanza and shoots her and eyebrow. \"... Okay. Good point, \" she says getting the point. Yang only shakes his head, \" This is incredible, but we need to stop it. What do we do? \" \" I-I-I-I'm not sure, \" the young man says. \" You not sure? You built something that can do, THAT, but you didn't have back up plan? \" \" What can I say lady, things just kind of work out for me. Hell I got into her without even going to college. \" \" I'll kill him, \" Stanza tries to rush him but Yang stops her. \" We need him. \" Studying the ball Yang thinks aloud. \" What if we break the entangler? Would that work or is it self sufficient now? \" \" Sure but it's over there… \" Yang and Stanza look to where their would be assistant points to on the floor. In that spot is a rather hobbled together thing that resembles a Dustbuster with a glowing vacuum tube sticking out of it. \" I-I-I think I can get it and turn it off. Once I re-calibrate the focus chamber it should work fine. \" Yang is stunned. \" You could have turned it off this whole time! \" \" Yeah, but you two keep talking. \" \" JUST GO DO IT, \" shouts Yang finally reaching the end of his rope. \" Holy shit fine! \" The young man runs for the energy ball, lightning strikes at his feet as he race to his goal. He grabs the strange gadget off the floor as he power slides under green ball of energy. On the other side he flips around and with a press of a button the ball of energy is gone. The lab is left blacked and scared, but is now very still. \" Thank God, \" Stanza says. \" Well, that was a thing. Now about you- What the hell, \" Yang looks on in horror as the young man fires his gadget at a white wall. This time what comes out of the end of the gadget leaves a flat green disk on the wall, just big enough for a man to walk through. \" Ha! Yes! Take that mother fuckers! \" The one time assistant looks back to the Doctors. \" That's right, it's a mother fucking portl gun! You remember this face! You tell'em that Rick Sanchez go the best of you! \" Rick flips them a double bird and starts to walk through the portal, \" Origin story bitches!

{"input": "A person is born unable to remember the most significant events in their life", "output": "The first time I realized I was different was when I was five years old, I had just started school and we were all sat around in a circle. We had just finished nap time and one of the boys had awoken screaming and shrieking like he was being murdered. The teacher, a kindly old woman who always wore the same pale maroon sweater had coddled him and then fetched us our milk before sitting us all down. She had the boy explain his dream and he told us he dreamed he had died. The teacher explained that this was nothing out of the ordinary and just a normal part of growing up. As we got older we would remember more and more of our past lives until we were adults and we could resume our careers. One by one she went around the small circle, asking us one at a time what we had remembered so far and if we had also begun to see flashes. I sat and listened, growing slowly more confused until she got to me. I had never dreamed of past lives, of adventures had and loves lost. In fact I did n't really seemed to dream at all, not that i remembered at least. I said as much and she told me not to worry, that sometimes the flashes started for different people at different ages. None the less the other children teased me. Calling me \" blank\" and \" stupid\" as I struggled to learn basic skills which they had already learned in their dreams. Things were hard. However it was n't until I was fourteen and I had slipped while running and broken my ankle that things first began to become strange. I was in the emergency room chatting with the doctor, he was questioning me about how I felt about about starting my career in a few years. I told him that I had no idea what I was supposed to be. Most likely with hindsight he suspected I had hit my head, but in truth I was beginning to become pretty concerned that my flashes had n't started yet and it all just came tumbling out. Over the next few years I was in and out of hospital periodically, undergoing tests to find out what was going on. Other than this my life was progressing normally. I developed an interest in working with wood and crafts; my creative flair was beginning to make my work distinguished and recognizable. People appreciated the art I built and slowly I was beginning to find my place. In the hospital however things had begun to take a turn I did not understand. The doctors were still unable to explain what was wrong with me. Furthermore the nurses had started speaking in hushed tones when I walked by them in the corridor. They thought I did n't hear them but I did. They said the doctors whispered that I was \" new\", that I should n't be possible. They said \" that boy is a miracle\". As more time passed the pressure began. People began to see me as having significance, although I myself could not see it. They would come to me all hours of the day, seeking answers, seeking understanding, some of them were even seeking a way out. These people bothered me. I did n't know what to do to help them and still they came. They would get hysterical and they would plead, there are so many problems of all shapes and sizes how could I be expected to fix all this. I needed to get away! I needed to find answers for myself! More time passed and I spent it in solitude, preferring to spend my time in casual anonymity than face up to the responsibility that people seemed so desperate to throw my way. I ambled the globe with little thought of time or consequences. My search for answers drove my travels of the the world. I continued with my love of working with wood and eventually somewhere along the way i picked up the nickname, \" the carpenter.\" On the road I made friends and I helped strangers, I tried to make the world a better place wherever i went. I was a friend to the needy and the desperate, to those on the fringes of society. I think I helped them and some of them chose to travel with me. I could n't please everyone though and I know that. I am sorry to those of you I could n't help or those I enraged. I had just never considered that the establishment would rise up like a snake to protect the immoral and the wicked. And now I sit here in my cell waiting for the morning sun and the death it promises. I was just trying to help people and be good, why would they do this? I'm scared, i'm not like everyone else, I'm \" new\". What if i do n't come back?", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

To perform such acts in public is lewd for such a conservative republic...\" A mournful cry with a head buried between two knees, \" My art misunderstood! Woe is me! My art!

Of course, he did not want to face his own treason courts that Tigellinus had worked so hard to bring back. The adviser shivered. At best, he'd suffer being dipped in hot oil as ravenous beasts of dark words ravaged his body with monstrous proportions. The worst would be having to withstand one of the emperor's \" human spirit monologues\". \" Emperor Nero.\" Tigellinus shortly interrupted, \" Perhaps a less... showy act of human cons --\" \" My art is from the gods!\" Nero raged, almost in childlike behavior, \" My art!

I shall bring the city's architect --\" \" No. I shall do it. With an artist's eye and perchance for fate.\" Nero mused, making the headache between Tigellinus's eyes grow larger, \" But first. I must consult my muses. My conversation piece, Tigellinus.\" Defeated, Tigellinus handed Nero the familiar fiddle that Nero grasped in his hands. Softly, deftly, he began to flick the strings with precision that was otherwise absent from him earlier. The sounds of music did assure his concerns.

{"input": "\" It never had to end this way, \" he said as he drew his gun... and she began her spell.", "output": "\" Hello?\" Kingsley smiled upon hearing the voice. Mellow, confident, with just a hint of sweetness like a drop of honey on the tongue. \" Hello?\" the voice said again. \" Ophelia?\" Kingsley said, leaning back on his armchair. \" I'll call you back in a minute, my supervisor wants a word.\" Sighing, he tossed his phone on the table next to him, beside a dew-coated glass of apple juice. Just hearing her voice brought back all the memories, of the days when they used to work together. The numerous travel assignments. The hotels, the late night drinks, the occasional drive on lonely country roads while listening to Bruce and Michael on the radio. Up until a year ago, when she'd quit, she'd been his other half. Not in any married or romantic sense, but there was no other word for it. He loved her, and she loved him, and they trusted one another. Knew how the other thought and felt. The grandfather clock chimed suddenly. It was one o'clock. Ophelia would be getting off work, soon. Maybe they would have time to catch up. Grab a beer at Pork's Hole. Maybe bowl a little. They'd grown up here, but this was his third day home in half a decade. She'd know the best places to go to. His phone began vibrating. Snatching it up, he said, \" Ophelia?\" \" Yeah. Who's this?\" He snorted. \" You've forgotten me already? It's King.\" \" Oh. Hi. How are you?\" \" I'm doing good. You?\" \" Still with the agency?\" \" Where else would I be? It's the only thing I've ever wanted to—\" \" Hey, Kingsley, it's been great hearing from you again, but I got ta go.\" He laughed. \" What's the hurry? Listen, I'm in town for this week. Let's meet for dinner.\" There was a pause. \" I'd love that, but—\" \" I wo n't take much time,\" he said. \" A couple hours tonight, maybe a beer, and then—\" Ophelia exhaled heavily. \" I ca n't. I've got a kid. My husband's on the road, and the babysitter's only available for half a day, so—\" Kingsley got up and went to the crib in the middle of the living room, stepping delicately over the prone body of a middle-aged woman. The baby in the crib smiled at him, her turquoise eyes shining. \" You have such a beautiful baby,\" he said softly, rocking the crib. It was almost an eternity before she said, \" My God. What are you talking about? Are you in my house?\" \" Like I said, I wanted to meet you.\" \" Get the hell out of there before I call the police!\" \" You hear that?\" He held the phone in front of the baby, who gurgled and reached for it. \" If you do n't want that sound to end, you'll not tell anyone about me. You'll come home right away. Understood?\" \" Please do n't hurt her,\" she said, now sobbing. Her child giggled, apparently recognizing her mother's voice. \" Do n't give me a reason to,\" he said. About twenty minutes later, he heard a car pull up in the driveway, followed by a door slamming and a key rattling in the lock. He was tossing a plush ball idly from one hand to the other when Ophelia burst into the room, her eyes wild as she surveyed the scene. She'd aged noticeably since their parting. Her face had more than a few lines, and white strands showed in her midnight hair. However, the bob cut she sported did give her a girlish look as well. \" You cock-sucking monster,\" she said, throwing her bag aside. \" What did you do to Sally?\" \" Depending on how our conversation goes, I either knocked her out or shot her.\" He gestured at the armchair across him. She was obviously longing to go to her baby, but for the moment, she obeyed. \" You know why I've come,\" he said. \" The agency does n't just let people go.\" \" I did the papers,\" she said. \" Everything. I was fully debriefed. Goddammit, they said I could go.\" \" They say a lot of things, right before they put one between your eyes.\" He shrugged. \" I did n't come up with that rule.\" Tears were beginning to pour out of her eyes. \" Kingsley, we're friends—\" \" Were,\" he said. \" Listen to me for one second, I'm begging you,\" she said. \" I had a baby! What was I supposed to do? Continue tracking down rogue magicians with you, while my baby grew up without a mother? How can I raise a child if we're killing dozens of people every month?\" \" Then you should n't have gotten married.\" Drawing his gun, he said, \" It never had to end this way, you know.\" Immediately, she raised a hand. Blue-white energy crackled in front of her palm. Her baby began to cry. \" We were partners,\" he said. Despite the harshness of his words, and the realization of what he had to do, his hands still shook. \" It's not too late. The agency'll take you back.\" \" I'll kill you, \" she said. He shook his head. \" Unfortunately, you were never good at being a sword. Credit where credit's due, you were a good shield though. I've had more close shaves than ever since you left. But you're not that good. Way I see it, you have a choice. \" The gun swung slowly toward the crib. \" You can protect your baby. But you'll die. Or, you can give up this farce. Lacy curtains? Porcelain turtle figurines? This isn't you. Come back to us. \" The sudden flare of blinding light caught him off guard, but he squeezed the trigger anyway. The bullet struck something with a solid impact, and then he heard it whiz past its ear. Shit, he thought. Ricochet! And then a screaming Ophelia was upon him, raking at his face with her nails. He pressed the pistol to her belly and fired three times. As his vision returned slowly, he found her lying on the floor, coughing up blood from her mouth. A sphere of shimmering blue light enclosed the crib, inside which the baby was bawling at the top of her lungs. Kingsley sighed as Ophelia's eyes closed, before dialing a number on his phone. When the man with the raspy voice answered on the other end, he said, \" It's done. \" *** *If you enjoyed this, check out [ The Nonsense Locker ] ( http: //reddit.com/r/nonsenselocker ) for more stories.

I'm going for dinner. You want anything while i'm out?\" \" Cornetto.\" Paul replied with an impish grin. North chuckled, \" You'll get red on you. See you in a bit.\" North hung his insulated lab coat on his customary hooks next to the first cryopod in the row, small flakes of ice drifting off the upright glass surface of the eight foot tall cylinder as the coat brushed past it. Lot of people in cryo today. A real record breaker of a day in fact. He and Paul had been running around like headless chickens just trying to get todays batch of people rich enough or important enough to spend their death day in suspended animation into the freezers. Just time for a quick bite to eat, then hopefully clear the backlog. The comparative warmth hit North in the face like stepping out of an old fashioned air conditioned airplane just arrived in Dubai, though the reception area was held at a steady comfortable temperature. A young man was making nervous small talk with the pretty receptionist, obviously a first timer waiting his first session as an ice cube for the day. \" So I had some success with the album and I figured that a few thousand to skip my deathday would be a pretty good deal, so here I am. I got ta say though, i'm a bit nervous about it.\" North trotted down the steps and out onto the street before Linda could start reeling off the standard spiel about how the process is safe and painless, while mildly flirting with the client to put him at his ease. Whistling cheerily he made his way through the familiar alleys and streets towards his favourite felafel stand. The watchful, hooded eyes of street youths and their transparent attempts to appear intimidating only served to amuse North. A muggers gun in the face held little threat when your deathday was a clear six months away, and these thugs knew it. He was just sinking his teeth into one of Sal's special spicy felafels when his phone chirped stridently in his pocket. A priority message. The felafel hit the pavement unheeded as he read the large red text of the message from Paul.'Get back to the lab NOW!\" He was moving before the food finished rolling into the gutter and bursting into the CryoTec building even before the first cockroach found it. Heart hammering out of his chest and lungs screaming for air, he barreled through the lab doors, fighting through choking clouds of vapourised coolant. Slipping and sliding on the slick floor, and gashing his knee on a cabinet, he made his way to where shouting could be heard. Paul was up to his waist in an access panel in the floor, frantically working through the billowing clouds of coolant, batting ineffectually at the mask of his hastily donned yellow hazard suit, trying to keep it clear of ice. \" What the fuck happened?\" North screamed, rubbing at the gooseflesh on his bare arms, the veins in his head pulsing with adrenal fear. \" Paul's voice, equally panicked squawked from the tinny speaker mounted on the chest plate of the suit. \" Feedback spike fom 307!

Sirens began to shriek from the cryotubes, first one, then others joining in until all four hundred and seven of the occupied tubes were adding to the cacophony. North sat heavily in the cracked leather chair and stared at the needles as they sat firmly at their bottom limits. The gouts of coolant from the floor hatch had petered down to next to nothing now and one by one the alarms were resetting and falling as silent as the occupants of their tubes. North jumped slightly as Paul's gauntleted hand lightly touched his shoulder.

I am not sure what made me do it, him calling me a loser or the fact I had a daughter the same age as the one he raped, but I just snapped. I flipped the knife open and told the turd \" tell me what happened or lose your finger \" he actually laughed out loud. \" You are a sad man with little threats, you are a joke, loser \". With one sharp stroke I cut off the tip his middle finger, the cut was so clean he didn't comprehend it, he just looked at his finger and then at me, I gave him a little smile. He looked down at his finger, now a in puddle of blood and he screamed and I mean a high pitched sustained scream that just didn't stop. Two officers rushed into the room and held me back. I was fired the next day. \" Are you going to daydream or do your job loser? \" Freddie asked with a bored expression. \" Wait a minute \" I said and walked into the kitchen, I found a big steel butcher cleaver with a convenient ergonomic handle. I grabbed Freddie's middle finger and held it to the table. \" Freddie, let me tell you how I lost my job as a police interrogator \" I watched Freddie's eyes grow big with fear as I told him the chopped turd story, his eyes were transfixed on the shiny cleaver in my hand. \" Now you show me some good progress and we won't have to count your fingers with fractions, is that clear Freddie? \".

Freddie left in with a hurried step. Lauren walked over to me and gave me a big hug, she pressed real hard against me and whispered in my ear \" Thank you Lewis, no one ever got through to him \".

There were steel beams thrown around like sticks and skyscrapers tipped, snapped and tossed about. Scatter around throughout the rubble were bodies and parts of bodies. The baby went on crying and crying, besides that all was silent. They had tried for nearly a year to have a child. They had gone to all the doctors, taken all the test. They kept trying.

The child developed well, he was strong. He would kick and push at his mothers womb often. They joked and laughed, he was excited to get out, excited to play and learn, to talk and dance. It was raining when the baby was born. There was a power surge and the lights flickered and went out for a moment. Lightning and thunder boomed outside. There had been high winds. But he was healthy. They counted his fingers and his toes and they were all there. He had bright blue eyes and no hair. The mother and child rested for three days, on the third the father took them home.

There was thunder and lightning that lit things up with a harsh white electric light. Rain poured down, hammering the roof and windows. The baby began to wail and cry. He slept between his parents in a little basket. They kneeled around him, picked him up and sang to him. It was dark and the rain hammered off the roof and windows. The thunder shook the walls. The baby went on wailing. There was a loud clap of thunder and for a instant the room was lit up with white light. For that instant the parents saw a room spinning around them. Clothes and computers, shoes and bags spun about circling them. They pulled him close. They did n't sing anymore, only waited for the storm to pass. From that night on there baby became more frightful. If a phone rang, a dog barked or a horn blared; he would go into a fit. Objects would fly, electronics would pop, fry and crackle. The houses walls would span and splinter and windows would shatter. They did n't tell their friends. They would n't take him to the doctors. They tried their best to keep him calm, to keep him quiet. They got him ear muffs, spoke softly, put their phones on silent. However, with each step they took he only became more and more sensitive. One morning the mother was sitting with the boy, rocking him gently in her arms when they heard a sound. It was a deep rumbling sound that she could feel in her stomach before it reached her ears. The room began to shake and sway. She looked down at her child. He was n't crying. His eyes opened wide, his pupils dilated. He did n't blink. Everything went still. The earth did n't shake, there was n't a sound. It appeared for a moment that time ceased to pass. The mother looked into her sons eyes and smiled. Then with a roar a wave of pure blackness exploded out from the child in a sphere. The mother, the father, their neighbors, birds, cats, trees and dirt, everything. Everything within a mile of the baby was instantly sucked up into nothingness, into the space between space, the area between time. Beyond that a wave of super compressed air expanded out in all directions. The ground was annihilated, fractured and cracked. Houses were swept from their foundations and skyscrapers snapped like twigs. As the air spread out away from the boy the destruction lessened. Cars tumbled, windows blew out, trees swayed and all went silent. The sun shinned down through puffy white clouds. There was a slight breeze. There was only one sound, the high pitched wail of a baby crying.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I was done trying tobe a person. This conversation had gotten ridiculous it was time to just have fun. I also *can* see magurple, I just let my stupid roommate think I can't so he can think that he can get away with *pretending* to see it. I actually sent him a link on Amazon to a white t-shirt that was pretending to be magurple. If he's shitting on Mindy Whateverson for pretending to see it, then fuck him. \" What? No, it's ma-gurple.

I went to a movie I didn't like or want to see, just so I could not be home and have an alibi for not checking my phone. And to my absolute delight, a flood of text messages came in; all pretty much demanding one thing. \" What's the name of that app? \" As soon as I got home, he was in my face, like my dog does now when I come home with food. \" Hey, uh…. \" He tried to play his desperation off coolly. \" Did you get my texts? \" \" Oh!

He had all day to come up with something, but he didn't. The lazy piece of shit could at least do me the dignity and tell me some outlandish story.

Anyway, goodnight, \" I went to my room and ignored him. Day one was a success. I wondered how long I could drag it out until he finally cracked and had to admit he was a phony himself. A month. I took a whole month of him asking me every single day what the name of the app was, demanding to see my phone, Googling Bing…ing, asking friends if they had heard of it, posting on reddit for advice. Until, finally, one day, \" Alright, Jesus Christ! \" That was me. I had enough of him asking me. Like all my evil plans, they kind of always took me along with them. It was like impaling your own hand to stab someone's face. \" I made it up! \" \" A-ha! I knew it! I knew you made it up! \" \" I fooled you, \" I smiled. We were both beaten pretty bad, but I can take the hits. This isn't my first battle, you plebian. \" No you didn't, \" he quivered a clear lie.

Marjorie appeared to be sipping honey from a tea cup. A pirate ship came floating over to the cloud with a Katy Perry look-alike I had never met before but somehow knew to be Zeus. \" I'm ever so sorry Marjorie but I need to borrow Lizzie for a moment.\" His voice was deeper than his body would suggest but no-one seemed to question this. \" Someone has stolen my favourite wombat and no-one seems to know who.

When the healthcare colonies all merged 12 years ago, we became the biggest united profession. While it is true we ca n't easily render resources as well or as specific as many other colonies, it is also true that at some point every single one of them needs us. It's reasons like this that allow people like myself to operate within otherwise restricted sectors. The IC is a whole different beast than what I am used to. When we underwent the upheaval from old society and transitioned to the new colonial system, it became apparent that geography, laws, demographics, markets, trade, entertainment, and even food will all greatly reflect the mentality of the average worker in each respective trade. For example, the both the west and east Industrial Colony has consistently been ranked as having the absolute worst education standards, and also the most bars, brothels, and blood sport venues. Not everyone here is into things like that, though. I am travelling in to perform what I suspect will be an appendectomy. Vince Cleary is the patient I am here to see. An interesting man, enough to be known even to members of the Medical Front. This guy was a regular construction worker, laying asphalt prior to the upheaval; Now he is the head of the IC's eastern sector. Only in this new world could you go from having no higher education whatsoever to being in control of generating 40 % of the entire nation's power. He is entirely ruthless too, regularly sending any of his laborers who jeopardize the colony to old Colorado's prison state. Only a fifth the size of the original colorado, but still more than enough space for the Corrections Union once they finally consolidated all federal prisoners into the area. It is most definitely not a place I want to end up. That is why I am going to utilize the utmost caution when interacting with and treating Mr. Cleary.

One way that this could be prevented was a new form of nail polish that changed color on contact with roofalin, AKA a roofie, AKA the date rape drug. It was my job to field test this drug. People would think that I was a typical woman at first glance, but that was n't the case - I happen to have a superb resistance to drugs, as well as being a trained police officer. It was my job to be a victim and try and let someone tamper with or buy a drugged drink. I did n't particularly like the color of pink nails, but it was the only one available. That, plus a nice, skimpy pink dress and a pair of high heels meant that I was n't just drifting into the crowd... but the problem was that most of the women here are doing the same thing. I see this one dirt-bag buy a drink for a sweet, young blonde - virginal, I'd say. She's almost certainly had a fake ID, but an underage drinker was n't my concern. He just said he'd ask the barman to give the girl a drink and... bingo, he's slipped the powder in while the barman was n't looking. A depositor in the sleeve... have n't seen that one in a long time. I manage to walk over towards her and start a small conversation. \" Nice make-up,\" I say to her as she receives the drink. \" I think it's a bit heavy, but it's your choice.\" \" Are you trying to make fun of me?\" she asked as she turned to me. \" Well, excuse me if I'm here for a good time.\" \" No, what I'm saying is that kids tend to just... paint it on,\" I reply, \" and do n't think I do n't know you have a fake ID. You're younger than my sister and she's not even past her second year in college.\" She tried to hide the shock on her face as I gave her a stern look. \" What are you, 18... 19? About that age? Here's a warning kid. You're a beacon for sexual predators.\" \" Oh, really?\" she asked, angrily. \" What, should I just... try and get my hands on that bullshit roofie nail polish?\" \" Here's a free sample,\" I said, handing her one of my spare bottles. She took a look at it, kind of shocked... before she realized that I had my fingernail in her drink and it was pure black. \"... You're a cop, are n't you?\" she asked, scared. \" You're not... going to arrest me, are you?\" \" You're young,\" I say to her. \" Go home and watch a movie, I'll have the bouncer pull him aside and arrested. Just do n't let me catch you here again without a valid ID.\" \" Yes, ma'am,\" she said, \" thank you, ma'am.\" She grabbed her purse and walked away, meeting another girl. A quick conversation and they, plus three others, walk out the front door. The bouncer is already on the guy, I had already signaled him, before I spill the drink onto the ground.

You guys'll probably think I'm full of shit, huh? I start blowing undulating vapor clouds, these'll help caress and sublimate the waves of disbelief around me. Nah, bro. This wasnt anything you might think. Watch, l'm gon na tell you how it went. I was still listening to Periphery back then. Well yeah I had heard the FFTL covers, he sounded better than Sonny I guess. That's not even anything im saying right now, wait up. \" Reaching for a way out of this dream, I waste my breath ascending...\" I had turned the volume up in my car for this one, quickly anticipating the soaring vocals to come. \"... fears lead me astray, the past brings them to be! What's left to carry mee!!??\" I had burst them out at the top of my lungs. Yeah, I could see this one girl in a black fluid car with blonde highlights snicker as I throttled by. Her gold strands had culminated in a messy bun, she must have thought I was on one. I was happy, I did n't give a fuck. I'd just gotten back from seeing Lyz, after not having seen her in a long ass time. So you guys have n't talked to her a lot since? She was in your class though, right? Well yeah, after high school when she moved over there to Avenal and started working, that's where I was coming from that night. Damn I hella made her laugh that day, fuck I was laughing like an idiot too, both of us! So after eating at this one place we were getting out of the parking lot right, and I guess the way I ended up parked that time- it was too close. Someone had parked too close to me by the time we got out. I ended up scratching that person's car while backing up. It was n't even a small scratch and like a dumbass I could n't even stop myself while I did it, that's kinda what made it funny! I do n't think it was going to be so fucking \" trill bro\" for the person who was going to come outside and find that on their car, but yeah. We just left! Well that was already by the end of it, I had a good time and headed home. She was happy I went to visit too. It was going to be dark a lot of the way back and I just started to drive faster. I remember that's when I started to blast the new Avenged Sevenfold song cuz they had barely made it, I did n't even know it was them at first. It had been a minute, huh. Yeah, Hail to the King. You know that one road when you take a right after you've left San Joaquin- well that's if you're going that way- and you just go straight to go to Avenal, that's where I was at. It's just pure empty fields over there. And well at that point at night, it had to have been eleven, it would n't have mattered much if farther ahead there was almond trees, some few small houses clustered here and there, or maybe a dimly lit shop along the way anyway. I was just a car in all of that indiscriminating darkness and I already wanted it to get me home. Up until that point it had been a really good day that summer, I had just gotten off work and spent the day with a friend, relaxing. That's probably why I did n't see it coming when it did. After some time had passed I pulled all my car windows up, no longer wanting to feel the invading chill I was driving to leave behind. At this point I have to pause my story, but they're actually listening to me without interrupting now. I think Johnathan even looked up from his phone. There quickly bubbles the need to burp loudly and I do. My bad, I resume. And you know what now that I start to think about it, maybe it was my intuition trying to warn me, something like the initial faint pangs of anxiety started from under me and were beginning to take hold. At first weakly and then more invasive, to the point my attention and energy were scattered all about me as I strained to look at what lied beyond the road through the windshield and into the fallen night. \" Hunt you down without mercy!!! Hunt you down all nightmare long!!!\" I reached for the volume and turned it down a bit. I was never really that into Metallica. I noticed my hands on the steering wheel were starting to vibrate from that rhythmic jitteriness of the car. And then more alarmingly, without warning, it seemed like the whole dashboard was starting to come alive with a violent rattling, followed by these last loud bangs of the engine apparently trying to absolve itself from the car, like the beatings of my heart by then that were coming out of my chest! I did my best to pull over to the dirt on the side of the road. There was an empty field and an irrigation canal right next to me. \"...you crawl back in but your luck runs out. Your luck runs ouutt!!\" The radio turned silent and I was marked by the strangeness of it all. In the darkness and the silence I knew it was about time to get out and inspect what had happened to my car. The stars were outside for me that night and in the dark I thought I was able to make out the outline of the hills I had just left moments ago. It looked like one of those red giant stars when it came over me, that's the best way I can put it, illuminating the yellow vestiges littered about the empty field and my silver car from under it. I was entranced. It had peered out originally from the hills to the south, and almost as if it had spotted what it was looking for, it had managed to traverse the entire distance in a matter of seconds. I made for the door and in my hurry I even hit my head on the way in. The car did n't want to start at which point I became paralyzed in fear. My headlights started to flicker and then they went out. To my surprise the red star had vanished as well. When they turned back on I had to blink my eyes for a bit, you'd have never have guessed where I found myself right after that! That's what I thought too, I thought I was still near Huron or something. I was like, fucking, two towns away in Tranquility! I swear to God I was right there next to the church at the corner of town and everything. My clothes were disheveled and I could feel were the blood was starting to dry down the side of my face. The stinging had set in. There was no way, there was no way. I got out a second time to walk and have a look around. I almost would have smiled when I looked at the scratch on the side of my car from the parking lot incident. But that's when the realization finally set in and the full weight of everything I had just lived in the last hour came down upon me with it's force. Everything in the outside world had become menacing and conspired to either consume or drive me out. From behind the church walls, I half expected the most grotesque of develish imps to scurry along my way and align itself with my legs, sinking at last its dagger teeth into my shins. The type of thing my imagination would have frightened me with only as a kid. I got in and apparently the car was working fine this time. Before I knew it I had made it back home with my fear. I had ended my story here and was n't thinking of adding much else when I noticed something about Johnathan's face had changed since the start of it. He seemed to be staring out into the distance, beyond the front porch where we were all at, and I suppose he was simply trying to find the right words that might help me come to terms with what I had told them happened to me that night. After a while he turned to face me, slightly began to smile, and said, \" Maybe we're all just crossfaded right now...\" I began to mirror him. I too looked out into the distance for a moment and then back at him, with a slight smile turning over my face. And then we all burst out lauging.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Then the woman looks at me, however, azure eyes piercing my soul, and suddenly nothing else matters. I collapse into the stool next to hers, trying to form another sentence. \" A Scotch, on the rocks,\" she replies after an imperceptibly short eternity, and even after I process the order, my brain refuses to let go of her words. On the rocks... I'm laying on the beach, picking up tiny handfuls of sand and hurling them at the seagulls, because I just want to go in the ocean but Mommy said it was a picture day and I must n't untie my tie because \" it took a lot of work to get it that way...\" I'm on the floor, my pants absorbing some odd stain from the linoleum. The bartender grasps my hand, and his firm grip grounds me from my spinning thoughts. \" What happened?\" I ask, not entirely sure who I mean to address as I settle back into the stool. \" It's hard to explain,\" the woman answers, which does nothing to ease my confusion. \" Get a drink in you,\" she continues, \" you're always so tightly strung and that makes it so much harder.\" I can agree, at least that I need a a drink, and I down whatever the bartender has handed me without hesitation. The woman offers her glass and I clink mine against it as she whispers, \" L'chaim.\" The corners of her pink lips curl upward... She's smiling because it's her wedding day, and I stand aside, the best man to my brother. She catches my eye, and she and I each take a breath because we know that they're not meant to be, although it's alright because next time... This time she catches me before I fall, and I mumble a thank you as I regain my balance. Her hands remain on my arms a moment too long, and, when she notices, she wrenches her hands back and apologizes profusely. She looks cute when she's embarrassed, so I return, \" It felt kind of nice, you know,\" wondering where my sudden confidence is coming from. Her face turns an even more adorable shade of red, and I marvel at how relaxed I am, and how little anything outside of the two of us seems to matter... A cold winter night, and she lays in her bed as I check the closet for ghosts. \" Daddy? Am I gon na be a ghost one day?

I nod, dumbfounded... \" My brother, Casper,\" she says, and I smile at her roommate as we shake hands. \" My boyfriend, Michael,\" and my leg is shaking as I meet her father's gaze for the first time. \" My son...\" I gasp and open my eyes, and our faces are mere inches from each other. \" Nessa?\" I ask. Tears are beginning to slide down my face. How long has it been? \" Yes, I'm Nessa,\" she returns, her eyes also releasing tears of joy. \" That was the life where you took me to prom.

I'm the only person that still smokes, and honestly, at this point, I'm just doing it because I feel like pissing off the rest of the world. It's at the point where I have to grow and roll my own cigs. Marlboro sold me their recipe after they went out of business, and I grow my own tobacco, roll my own stuff, etc. The government has tried everything. First, the Prohibition of 2021, which cut smokers down by 97 %. Then came the crackdown on dark web sellers, and eventually everyone got caught smoking. They found the names of people that had n't signed up for drug tests, until the only people left were the ones off the radar. And then, the military swept the streets and found everyone that was left. It was May of 2038 when I was announced the last smoker in the United States. But here's the thing: they did n't arrest me. I had gone for multiple tests while smoking, never once did they stop me. Just told me I failed. I think it's because I simply did n't care, and therefore the government did n't care. It's kinda like breaking into a bank, and then when the police come to arrest you, you just say, \" No.\" And then they stop, confused, and just walk away. Well, after that, of course, you become a national celebrity. The government still wanted me to stop, of course, but they could n't really make me without locking me in a room for three weeks and making me cold turkey it out. So, first, they tried laws against growing tobacco. \" Okay,\" I said, \" You win. SIKE!\" And continued to grow more tobacco for myself. Then they tried ad campaigns. This is where it got annoying. I could n't even go to the grocery store without seeing my face plastered to a wall, smiling back at me with the words \" JUST QUIT GREG SCHMIDT\" in big red letters surrounding the picture of my head. I was known by all, people pointed me out in the street. It was no use going somewhere else, either. One time I drove from my house in Virginia to New York City, and lo and behold, there I was in the middle of Times Square, my smiling meth mouth of a face looking at me among the words \" YOUR FAMILY PROBABLY HATES YOUR FILTHY HABIT.\" They were n't even trying to rhyme anymore. They straight up hated me and wanted me to stop. So, when I was 45, 28 years after I had lit up my first cigarette, I decided that there must be something in the Constitution that protects me from this kind of public degradation. Nope. I took it to the Supreme Court and everything, no dice. The only people that liked me were teenagers that thought it was cool to stand up to the government and media sources that made money off of my \" developing story of a life.\" I'm not even kidding. That's what they call my life. The catchphrases are n't much better, if one can even call them catchphrases. Here's a list of my personal favorites: - SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOU ( no shit ) - JUST STOP SMOKING GREG - WHY DO YOU SMOKE, YOU BIG FUCKING JOKE - THE POLICE ARE COMING GREG ( ahahahhahahhahhahaha ) - ( my personal favorite ) JESUS CHRIST YOU STUBBORN BITCH I do n't know what to do anymore. My house is the only haven I have, if you consider a building constantly surrounded by paparazzi trying to take a picture of you a haven.

We are a universe created from someone else's hands. The real Gods are in the dimensions around us. I am merely a numerical beginning bringing you bad news. All that we know to be life is an experiment. And we're all manipulated into thinking that it is something greater than that. Now, please, do n't cry. I will tell you the same thing that I told Socrates: Live life to the fullest. The truth does not need to take meaning away, rather, it could give meaning.

Today would be a grim day for the people of the kingdom. Victory against the awesome Korkack was but a thin dream, unreachable even by the diligent or strong. But, if there was one thing that this King knew, it was that the most important action to take was that of making an effort. So he charged in, with the tip of blade poking straight into the dragon's belly as it bellowed a mighty roar of laughter and picked the king up by the hem of his furred cloak. The king struggled desperately, kicking and swinging in an effort to break free and resume the fight. His efforts were for naught, however, as the dragon was still fully fresh to fight and enjoying his pathetic attempts of fighting quite vigorously. With the last of his breath, the King let out a final exhale as the dragon pulled a long talon up to his armor-bound chest. First the greaves were slashed off like thin paper. Then came the gauntlets that came crashing down to the floor, signalling the \" fight's\" ending. With a sneer of pride, the dragon held the king by his head with a strong grasp of two fingers, putting a sharpened claw to his chest. *\" And then did Korkack slash the king's breastplate right off, revealing'his'ample milky bosom! \" * *\" For you see, the King was no King at all!

The only problem is your inability to actually perform magic.", "output": "Magic. To many of you civilians, it's known as little more than a vast, mysterious force, capable of impossible feats. In reality? It's... well, it *is* a vast, mysterious force that's capable of impossible feats, but it's not like we have n't studied it to figure out how it works. What we call magic is essentially the capacity of the soul to generate, manipulate and store aetheric energy. It's a unique form of energy that's capable of creating what I like to call subpockets of reality; essentially, it creates a zone in which physical laws can be altered to your will, which is how the most basic spells are created. Fireball, for example. Superheat the air in a pocket into plasma, and give it more mass and velocity than it should be able to have. Results in terrible burns. Really, it's a lot more deadly a spell than people think, for some thing so incredibly basic. More complex, wide-ranging spells are a little different - you ca n't just create a small subpocket to work with. You need to imbue the entire area with aetheric energy, and that comes with a whole host of problems that I'm not going to go into. Simply put, an unskilled mage is more likely to spontaneously combust than succeed at a tier three spell. Or anything above that, obviously. Me? I'm a little different. I'm a mage, of course. Got my own tower and everything. You do n't see me performing any spells because... well, I ca n't. Do n't laugh. Most human souls can generate aetheric energy. Mine ca n't. I can still manipulate it, but as far as generating or storing it goes, I'm entirely incapable. But do n't worry! That's why you're here. See, I ca n't generate it on my own, but I've built a spell that can sap little bits of aetheric energy from the environment, and a container spell to store it for me. The best source of energy is still a human being, though. Here's a contract, just sign here... Thank you. Now, I just need you to wear this wristband for a short while.

Try using shorter paragraphs mixed with longer ones ( same goes with sentence length ). Two is your use of \" I\". Your story is already a fairly tight 1st person POV.

Gladiatorial fighting suddenly became a socially acceptable and beloved sport in the United States, even rivaling the NFL in terms of viewership. Thousands of the desperate poor masses began to sign up, winning just one fight would ensure that a man could support a family of four for a whole month, work was hard to come by, but the Colosseum was always open to the unemployed. Only about 1 in 5 people in the prison were there for economic reasons though, most of them were criminals. They were murderers, rapists, hedge fund managers, the worst of the worst. Nobody had any empathy for the daily blood bathes in the stadium. I arose from my bed and began to put on my armor, cheap hardened leather that had already taken a number of beatings. I was supposed to buy new equipment after my first victory last week but my daughter became sick and the medication was more pressing than a chest plate. The guard opened my cell door and shoved a polearm into my arms, it was a wooden spear with a sharp bronze point, about six feet in length. \" Um, excuse me sir, but last time I fought a with gladi-...\" \" I do n't care what the fuck you used to kill that guy, maggot, you're stuck with it. Now hurry up and march.\" The guard shoved me forward and began to walk forward down the damp hall to the stairs at the end of the hall. The guard opened the trap door above me and light streamed in, temporarily blinding me. Across the sandy killing floor about fifty feet away was a lone man in full bronze armor, except for a missing helmet which allowed his long black hair to flow down his back. He was armed with a large broadsword that required two hands to hold but seemed to be no struggle for him. My knees began to shake as I began to inch closer to this warrior and we began circling each other to look for an opening. The Colosseum around us was packed, people were filming the slaughter that was about to unfold. I could see a woman near me was on snapchat, getting ready to record my death. I shuddered. It was disgusting. This was all so disgusting. But I had no choice. I need the money. My daughter needs the money... I let out a scream and charged the warrior with my spear, who easily knocked it away and sidestepped the attack. I yell out another yell and tried to stab his exposed side but he brought his great sword down on the shaft of my spear, snapping it on two and sending me sprawling into the sand. I had lasted all of 20 seconds. I was going to die. This was the end. The warrior stood before me, holding his sword at my throat. The entire stadium was affixed on one man in the audience looking down from a balcony. He held his thumb sideways before gesturing thumbs down to the delight of the crowd. We interlocked eyes as I realized what was about to happen, the sword pierced my throat and then there was silence and I descended into nothingness.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

He was frail and old. The Herculean role model that had always been in my life was lying in a hospital bed. \" Never show your weak side to others, because there are people out there who will stab you the first chance they get, \" he would say. True enough, he was always strong-willed, calm, and kind of like a gentle giant. He was the type of person that gave off this aura that made you know nobody crosses him, but in the safety of our home, he was a funny and loving father. Many more memories flashed through my mind. I choked back a sob and turned around, just in time for a tear to dribble down my cheek. My son was with me, and I wasn't going to let him see me like this. \" Rob, I'm going to the toilet. \" \" Okay, Dad. \" Rob was always a nice kid. I thank God every day I met my wife, because it was almost like we were meant to be together. We made a great tag-team that raised what had to be the perfect kid. He was polite, understanding, and mature. Maybe not the most intelligent, but he was mature enough for us to never have to worry about his academics. I exit the room and made my way to the toilet, holding back as best as I could. I was immensely thankful the corridor was empty. Visiting hours were almost over anyway. Sister Mary gave me a pass and told me I could stay back a little. My father had been in-and-out the hospital for the past few years, and I had almost become a regular customer in the hospital. It's sad to even talk about it. Most of the staff in the ward knew us on first-name basis, and had I not been so dazed throughout the entirety of my father's bout of sickness, I would have remembered at least one of their names. I turned left into the service area where the toilet was located, and broke into a run. I couldn't hold back the tears anymore. I bawled into the sink for as long as I felt safe in the isolation. When it did not any more, I was satisfied to move into the cubicle and chew the hell out of my sleeves as I silenced my sobs and gasps. The memories were flashing through my mind again. The one that struck me the most was five or six years ago when I woke up the middle of the night to use the toilet. It was the summer holidays then, so I had told Rob he could do whatever he want, as long as he finished his holiday homework and got back into an appropriate sleeping cycle a week before school. I vividly remember having this conversation as I was in the toilet with him in the living room. \" I know, Dad. My homework's already done. You know you can trust me. \" \" I do, but – Wait, already? \" I would have peeked out the door to look at him, but the damn toilet bowl was located on the inner corner. \" Yeah, it's not a lot. You can check it if you want, \" he replied smugly. It was almost a challenge. \" It's all in my school bag. \" \" It's ok, I trust you. Good job, \" I hollered back. As I exit the toilet door to see what he was up to, I did a double take. My father was also there with him. They were playing a video game together. \" Dad? \" \" Oh, you noticed I was here? Did all my shouting and dancing give me away? \" he asked. I could see a smile flash across his face as he was still fixated on the television screen. The acidic sarcasm was not lost on me. I heard a soft giggle coming from Rob. \" What are you doing? Aren't you going to sleep? It's two in the morning. \" \" It's more fun to play games with somebody else. Right, Rob? \" \" Yeah! \" Rob answered enthusiastically. \" So you go: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, \" my father said. \" What does that do?! \" Rob jumped onto the sofa, visibly excited. \" It gives you an extra life, but I've never gotten it to work. Here, Rob, you try, \" he handed over the controller. Rob tried inputting the code, but I wasn't sure if it worked, because I was too far away to hear anything. \" It worked! We've got 30 lives now! You've got the buttons mixed up! \" \" That would be too easy though. Let's restart the game. It's more fun that way. \" I bit harder into my sleeve as tears rolled down my eyes. A few months later, he was diagnosed with cancer. The equivalent of living life on hard mode. That was the last time I had seen him well. \" Dad? \" I coughed to clear the phlegm in my throat. I was brought sharply back into the present. \" Y-Yeah? \" I asked, my voice wavering, distinctly nasal. \" You okay? \" \" Yeah, I was just – \" \" Dad. It's okay. I love you. Can I come in? \" I hesitated. Open the door and let him see me like this? \" Dad? \" \" Yeah. \" Right as I opened the door, he ran up to me and gave me a tight hug. We spent a good few minutes just hugging. I might have imagined him sobbing a little into my back as well, but he sure hid it well. I felt safe in his embrace. I knew he was okay with seeing me with all my walls broken down. Vulnerable. It felt strange, but I reveled in this strange feeling. We strolled back to the ward to see my father just lying there. I had hoped beyond hope that he would miraculously be well. Almost as though on cue, his pulse started getting erratic, and almost as quickly as it started, his pulse stopped. \" Dad? DAD! \" \" NURSE! \" \" NURSE! \" I shouted repeatedly. I pressed the button for help. The nurse ran in and ushered both of us out. \" You have to be outside. \" \" No, no, I want to be here – \" \" You HAVE to get out, \" the nurse repeated with a tone of finality, as the doctor entered the room. I stepped back outside the room, my eyes fixated on the heart monitor the entire time. The green line seemed strangely hypnotizing. The nurse closed the blinds, and the only visual indicator of what was happening in the room was gone. I turned my back and collapsed against the wall. I knew this day was coming. I thought I had mentally prepared myself for the worst, but today I learned we are never truly ready for death's embrace to rip the lives of your loved ones away from their body. I covered my face in my knees, crying. My pants were quickly becoming wet. \" Dad, sit down on the chair. Have this, \" Rob said, handing a piece of napkin to me. I don't know where he got that, but I couldn't care. After what felt like forever, the doctor opened the door. The look of resignation on his face told me more than I needed to hear. I went in and sent a text to my wife. She had to know about this. I looked back up at my father, virtually in the same position as before, but he just felt so… Different. \" Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, \" I heard Rob mutter. \" Rob? \" \" Dad, it's not working… \" I was surprised to see Rob crying so hard. I underestimated how close the two of them were. I brought him in closer and the two of us just cried together. \" It's okay, Rob… It would have been too easy if he could just come back. \"", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

Someone to talk to, to share my life with. But I had already dug myself into the pit of loneliness, and there was no getting out now. I figured there was no point living like this anymore. There was no point to my existence and I just wanted it to end. My'skip to content button'had been buried at the back of my wardrobe. I threw it in there when I was eighteen and completely forgot about it. But now I figured I may as well press it. Either it would skip straight to my death, or something interesting would finally happen to me. I held my breath, and pressed the button. At first, nothing happened, I was disappointed, was it broken? Then, in the distance, I thought I could hear screaming. The ground began to shake under my feet, and I wondered what the hell was going on. I ran outside just as the buildings on my street began to collapse around me, reducing themselves to nothing but dust at my feet. The screams got quieter, but I tried to follow the sound. My town had been reduced to nothing but a wasteland. Every building had been reduced to nothing, rubble and dust swirled in the air and gathered in my lungs. The sun was glowing red, and looked to be around five times its normal size. *Was this the end of the world? * I tried desperately to find another person. Another soul to try and make sense of all of this. But there was no one. Days passed and I could n't find any other humans. Living or dead. Part of me wonders if everyone knew this would happen, and they managed to escape. I would n't know. I never watched the news, and people never spoke to me, so I would have no idea. Desperation began to set in as I frantically searched for someone. Anyone. How could everyone on Earth just be gone? My button was crushed in the rubble, so I could n't even skip to the next meaningful event. My days were filled with endless walking, and constant false hope. It was a miserable existence. Finally, we get to today. Thirty one years have passed since my house turned to rubble at my feet. Thirty one years since I've seen another living being. The world is a haunting place, full of memories and whispers. I hope one day that if the people of Earth did escape, that they might come back and I will get to see another human before I die.

I'm not so much of a computer whiz myself but my sidekick Marla is and she was kind enough to whip up this great little hacking program for me. In no time at all, I find the files I need and download them onto a thumbdrive. The process is almost complete when I hear a sound at the door. \" Hey, who are you? \" I look up. Two of Ombre's lackeys stand in the office doorway. They're big and muscular and the look in their eyes tells me that they wouldn't have any qualms about beating up a woman. Carefully, I slip the thumbdrive into my pocket, then reach back to my quiver to draw an arrow. Empty. Crap. Crap, crap, crappity crap. How can my quiver be empty? Marla was supposed to refill it. What is wrong with sidekicks these days? Maybe my next sidekick should be an orphan or an ex-prostitute. Those seemed to have worked out well for some of my peers.

He goes down. I twirl and hit the other one in the chest, then bring my bow down on his wrist. He cries out and drops the gun.

Once again some prompts are close or similar to previous prompts and my response still works. I like to write, but am also self conscious about it. I need encouragement and it is always nice to see another person give me their support, another person to remind me my dream is attainable. We live in an age where we can get up to date feedback and help, and sometimes I feel like I just ca n't get it done. Getting people to come read what I have done and suggest some improvements helps me continue to write.\" The jury was now active nodding along with my words. I had them eating of the palm of my hand. Now I just needed to finish it off perfectly, like icing on a fresh baked cake. \" And finally, my commenting first. All of you who have ever read the responses to a prompt on WritingPrompts know as well as I do that only the first comment has any chance at upvote success. Few people read past the first story, much less every response to the prompt. Only the fastest succeed, and it is part of the challenge, picking a prompt that will be popular enough to be upvoted.

Somehow I manage to watch twelve minutes of television without losing interest, that's the longest I've watched television since I started my medication. I must be getting better. I must be. Four minutes were adverts. The rest were some kids cartoon. I watched it muted with subtitles so that it did n't break the silence. When the credits roll, I recognise the song that plays from the words appearing at the bottom of my screen. \" Island Song \" by Ashley Eriksson. My therapist had played it for me once, said that music would help the healing process. Said it would help get me used to loud noises again. I mouth the words as not to break the silence. *Come along with me And the butterflies and bees We can wander through the forest And do so as we please. * Next thing I know I'm walking through a supermarket. Walking through rows and rows of branded things in bright packaging. I feel normal, which is good. My medication must be working. I look at the shopping list clenched between my sweaty fingers: *PG Tips, Chicken Korma ready meal, pasta, Tomato Soup, Baked Beans, a small loaf of brown bread, Tropicana. * I cross them off as I add them to the basket. My stomach rumbles. I make sure I do all my shopping at night in large twenty four hour convenience stores. That's the only way to make sure I can shop in silence. I wear ear plugs to keep the footsteps out or any echoed murmurs and lip read if the cashier asks me anything, but I prefer to use the automated checkout because they do n't give me funny looks. My stomach grumbles. Groans. When I return home and place my carrier bags on the kitchen table, beside another fruit bowl filled with lemons, I realise the bags look all wrong. I could have sworn I bought the normal stuff. The bag is filled with yellow. PG Tips boxes are normally blue. The Chicken Korma ready meal is normally in purple packaging. The Tomato Soup and Baked Beans come in red cans. Nothing I buy is yellow, but the bag is filled with a golden glow. I double check my shopping list. At a glance it all seems normal. Lots of scribbled writing, words of varying shapes and sizes with neat lines passing through them. Upon closer inspection it all reads wrong: ~~*Lemons. Lemons. *~~ *Lemons, ~~Lemons~~, Lemons. * *Lemons Lemons Lemons ~~Lemons Lemons Lemons~~ Lemons Lemons. * I drop the list and check the bag. Just like the list the bag is filled with Lemons. I open the second carrier bag. It is filled with lemons. My stomach rumbles. I'm hungry and I do n't want to eat lemons. Best check the sealed cupboards. I peel back a little tape, but I do n't like the sound. It hurts, sends great quakes through my mind and all its corridors. I rip it off and lemons fall out like a great gold waterfall. They hurt as they hit me, but their bouncing and splattering noises hurt me more. I'm hungry so I stagger to the fridge. I tear the tape and feel my mind and its corridors crumble. It scolds my soul as I rip it from the fridge. A yellow waterfall ensues. The freezer? \" No! \" It's the same. I need some food, I need my medication, \" I need a little god damn silence! \" I ca n't find my pills, only lemons. Lemons and more \" God damn fucking lemons! \" I take a bite. It calms me. I breathe. Next thing I know I'm on the sofa. Knees together. Back stretched upright. I'm watching kids cartoons on mute. I tilt my neck towards the kitchen. The cupboards are sealed shut with thick brown tape. The fridge, too. And the freezer. The kettle lids askew, held on with thick brown tape. I feel normal.

I could n't help but stare, in awe, at the spectacle that was the gargantuan prison that lay before me. The colossal stone slab plastered across the front wall read \" Jeremiah Manson's Criminal Institute for the Mentally Unstable\". Below it was the quote from Jeremiah Manson himself: \" Those beyond redemption.\" Even with my prior experience, nothing would prepare me for this. I was n't green as grass, yet I felt that I knew nothing about this place, before I even walked through the doors. As I reached the gate, that would dwarf even an elephant in size, I came across a pad, that implied I was required to scan my finger to be granted access. I placed my right thumb against the glass pane, and quickly drew it back as a biting pain ran through my hand. I looked at my thumb, to find it bleeding. The pad beeped, and the gates slowly slid open. I swore under my breath, and, sucking my thumb, strode through the gates. The first thing I saw was the cells. Not cages; no metal bars, no tattooed tough guys calling me dead meat. In fact, the cells were tubes. In each of these tubes, were inmates, dressed only in a spandex full body jumpsuit, covering everything but their faces. They were levitating, hands seemingly forced against their chests; and looks of terror plastered across their faces. On the tubes, were timers. I assumed these timers were how many months or years the inmates had been inside the tubes. I heard yelling, coming from the gates, and the next thing I knew, an inmate was being dragged into the complex; dressed in a spandex suit. Three guards, dressed in navy blue, armed with rifles, nightsticks, and tazers wrestled the inmate into a tube. One of the guards slammed the door, and the inmate began screaming, and pounding on the tube's door, a look of desperation on his face. A different guard pressed his thumb to a pad, similar to the one I was subjected to, and, after a momentary wince, drew back his bloodstained thumb. The pad flipped open, and a button was revealed. The guard hit the button, and two glass panels on the top and bottom of the tube whirred to life, glowing with a cyan hue. The inmate, seemingly frozen, moved into a'dead'position, his hands folded across his chest. I did n't know why, but I knew he was not moving of his own free will.

Well, that's all one big fat lie, I've experienced it personally on several occasions, trying to play hero and all, but it's nothing short of agonizing. It's not the stab that's the worst part. First your blood goes everywhere and you start feeling light headed, next your thoughts start being muddled as your brain is slowly starved of oxygen, and then... well that's the hardest part, you continue feeling each and every single inch of your body writhe in agony as they also slowly died as well. Your lungs, your muscles - oh god the cramps you get -, you whole nervous system firing out massive amounts of signals. You get the idea. Unfortunately a deal with the gods isn't always clear cut and trick free. Being immortal does NOT mean being invincible. A knife goes through my gut, I spew out my intestines while frantically trying to keep the damned slippery things inside while my dinner hits the pavement. Damn, I remember spending five hours preparing that slow roast and it was all over the floor. Little tip before accepting a deal with a gods - make it as specific as possible. The gods are assholes. Immortality? Sure. You won't die but you can still get hurt. You'll heal from any wound, sickness, basically anything that can kill you, though you'd have to technically almost'die'first before it happens. I remember them laughing about this one time a guy wanted to fly. They turned the poor sucker into a fly. Like I said. Assholes. I thought it was a great deal, I'd be a superhero, a celebrity, maybe even a god on earth! Oh boy was I never so wrong. I met her one day picking flowers at a nearby park. It was a beautiful sunny day and I just finished saving a little girl from drowning after she jumped after her dolly - Oh, by the way, drowning also sucks-. I was an odd sight to behold, soaking wet with hair plastered on my face, a stray piece of river weed sticking out of my nostril, basically I looked like a zombie. At first she looked like she was about to panic, to call the cops or something but then she walked up to me and wrapped her jacket around me. Well, that was unexpected. \" T-thanks… \" I managed to stutter out, the hypothermia having set in after spending over a few hours in the water. I shivered then collapsed onto a nearby bench, the sunlight was much welcome, and I basked in it for a few minutes, ignoring the woman as she looked over me with her inquisitive gray eyes. \" Usually people call the hospital or cops when they see walking drown victims strolling about. \" I said, nearly completely healed up by now. \" Well... I... kinda lost my phone so I did the next best thing… \" I looked at her with the blankest look I could muster, wondering if she was serious before I burst out laughing my ass off. Well, long story short we ended up having a chat. Me in my smelly filthy water stained clothes, and her in her white sundress and slippers. I wanted to exchange numbers but apparently she was serious about having lost her phone so instead she invited me back to her place. I guess she figured out I was gon na be alright so she instead offered me a hot shower and a change of clothes before I left off, gave my thanks, and left my number with her should she get a new phone. We met a few times, usually at the same park being near my usual route and after a few dates, one of them ending with me playing hero and jumping in front of a truck to save an old lady, we decided to take it to the next step. We were back at her place, having just had dinner in the park where we first met, a small evening picnic by the flowers. Then the unexpected happened. Luring me into the kitchen she began kissing me, surprising me with her... uhm... ferocity and pushed me against the counter while reaching behind me to pull my shirt off, well at least that's what I thought she was doing. Before I knew it I had a solid steel knife - really nice brand by the way, easily cut through my sternum - planted in my chest. I looked at her in disbelief as she repeatedly plunged the knife in my chest cavity, Stab after stab after stab after stab. While repeatedly saying \" I'm sorry \" in between sobs and stabs. It would've been hilarious had it not been so painful and eventually she collapsed of exhaustion with the knife still sticking out of chest. An hour later I got up, my favorite shirt ruined with blood and holes, and pulled the damned knife out before pondering on whether or not I should call the cops or not. It didn't take long for her to get back up and apologize. She explained the whole curse thing before plunging the knife back in my chest cavity. I guess some impulses are hard to resist. I laid there coughing blood as she continued her ritual of stabbing and sobbing and collapsing once more. This happened several times that night and eventually she just stopped moving altogether having died of exhaustion. I closed her eyes and sat there staring at the mess we caused. There was blood everywhere but none of it was hers. I could hear them now, laughing their asses off in their damned thrones in the sky.

Few these days knew the secret of fashioning the horns which may call beasts and Klegorn was proud to work his ancient trade. Filling his mighty lungs a second time, he continued to sound his horn. It boomed sonorously across the hills and even once Klegorn ceased to blow, it echoed on for what seemed an impossible span. He nodded contentedly and cast his eyes to the sky. Soon enough, the quiet summer day was stirred by a great wind and strange shapes began to dot the sky. Klegorn laughed merrily and cast his arms up. The Breaking would soon begin. Dravin was having second thoughts about dragons. Dragons were all well and good, he thought to himself, inside stories or tucked away in their remote caves and mountain lairs. It is entirely a different thing, he thought, when one is clinging tenaciously to a dragon for ones life. Dravin gripped his dragon harder and screamed, in what he hoped was a masculine way. \" Stand up!\" screamed a voice. Dravin looked around cautiously. It was captain Klegorn, the old troll, riding comfortable beside him. \" If you do n't stand up right now and take those reins, you'll feel my lash boy\". Klegorns voice was distressingly clear, despite the deafening wind. Dravin grasped at where he thought the reins might be. Finding them out of reach, he made a slight adjustment. The world dipped sickeningly at that moment as his dragon began diving for speed. Dravin found himself awkwardly wrapped around the dragons tail when he dared to open his eyes again. He was almost certainly going to die. \" None of that slacking off there boy, I want you to climb back into that saddle and fly a thousand miles into the sky!\" shouted Klegorn. \" Sir, that would put me in space, sir\" Dravin somehow managed to say \" No backtalk boy, get to it!\" Captain Klegorn landed his dragon and called for an aid. A squire quickly rushed to help him dismount. \" A fine crop this year Finneus\". At that moment, Dravin crashed violently into the ground next to him. He lay there, quite dead, while Klegorn looked over his other recruits with a spyglass. A few had managed to stand and hold their reins properly, but it seemed that most would share Dravins fate. If any made it through the rest of training, he would select the best and teach them the secret of carving the horn and the calling. Most likely though, none would survive. Dragons are capricious creatures, few are fit to ride them. Another student fell to the ground nearby, accentuating his thoughts. Klegorn sauntered over to his body.

At the joints, it felt like they were held together with deeply sunken screws. His hands were shackled to the arms with literal chains, locked to heavy bolts sunken into the wood. He could n't reach his feet, but the chains there made him suspect the same. He shifted back and forth, but the weight of which the chair was made caused it to be almost impossible to turn over. The bandana over his eyes was layered again and again, and he could see no light at all. How long had he been here? It could n't have been that long. He had n't eaten and did n't feel hungry. He had n't felt the urge to relieve himself yet. So, maybe only a few hours? He was n't sure what had happened. He'd been walking to his car in the parking lot after closing up at the store. He'd parked around the side of the building, so the customers could park out front. As he'd headed to his car, the spotlight on the side of the building had blown out, and in the darkness, something had grabbed him. He scuffed his feet, feeling smooth concrete underneath. He was n't gagged, but he had n't tried screaming yet. He was n't sure it would help, and wanted to try and find out more about where he was. That's when he heard another sound. Heavy thuds of a steel door being opened, then the slow, measured steps of booted feet. There was a light scraping sound in front of him and he tried not to tremble. \" Seems you're a cagey one, are n't you, child?\" came a voice in a smooth Southern drawl. The tones were of a gravelly baritone, and there was a small echo in the room. \" You did n't try to tip over the chair. You did n't start screaming. That's a good thing. See, if you had, a chair made of what that's made of would have fallen on top of you and probably broken something. As for the screaming, well, I would've had to put a stop to that.\" There was another rattle of chains, directly in front of him. \" You've been waiting on me to arrive, trying to scheme your next move.\" This new set of chains rattled again. \" I commend your... grit, I suppose, but there will be no scheme, child.\" That's when a chain-wrapped fist smashed into the side of his head. The chair did n't rock as his body was rocked by the force of the blow. \" I ca n't have you trying that sort of nonesense. There's much more on the line here.\" Another punch hit him, right under his eye. \" We're working on something important, child.\" The captive finally uttered to his captor. \" What do you want with me? Why?\" \" Ah,\" came the answer, slow and drawn out. It was like this unseen captor was savoring it. \" Seeking understanding in the darkness. Well, I suppose telling you a little bit wo n't hurt anything.\" Another punch crashed him, into his stomach, causing him to double forward. A pair of quick booted steps and a hand grabbed the captor by the back of the head and pushed him forward. He retched violently, emptying his stomach on the floor. The next time the voice slithered out of the darkness, it seemed right next to his ear. \" You see, child, it's two-fold. First, a creature like me feeds on the dark parts. Your fear, your anger, your pride, they all make me stronger. But that, that's only a side benefit.\" The grip on his head flung him back into the chair. \" The real point, is that the law enforcement in this country has gone soft. Complacent. They need a real challenge. And so, here we are. They think in such... concrete terms. It never occurs to them that something like me might be out there. They'll need to learn otherwise if they're going to handle those that come along behind me.\" There was a deep chuckle and a length of chain settled around his neck. __________________________________________________________________________________ The report was stark in its presentation.

{"input": "Ask Lexi # 10 - Outlines vs Winging It", "output": "I've heard a number of successful published authors advocating one method or the other, and I've often wondered - but not really seen discussed - is whether the kind of story you're writing might have an influence on which method is going to be more effective for you. For example, it seems like a lot of epic fantasy writers heavily lean towards architecture. Maybe that's just part of the world-building mindset that tends to drag people towards fantasy in the first place, but it seems like these kind of extended, plot-driven narratives spanning multiple volumes would probably hold together a lot better if you planned out what was going to happen in advance. That's not to say it's the only way to do that kind of story, but I feel like maybe it's a genre that particularly favours that way of writing. On the other hand you've got Stephen King, who according to his biography is very much a gardener. While there's still some genre overlap, a lot of his works are stand alone and as he puts it, based more around a situation and his characters'response to it than a plot ( in fact he seems to regard plot in general with a kind of suspicion ). Again, this feels like the kind of story that would especially favour a gardening style - if you want to write about how people react to a particular unfolding situation, it makes sense not to box yourself in with the knowledge that they have to end up in a particular state. I'm sure there's much more to it than that, and that the kind of writer you are and your own creative process have at least as much of an effect as anything else. However, it might be something worth bearing in mind if, for example, your epic plot-driven novels seem to keep falling apart or going around in circles towards the end, or conversely if your fast-paced thriller is starting to feel a little too wooden and formulaic.

There's not a soul who doesn't know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I've been to the funeral of three of them alone. I've hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister's life. And what'd she do? I don't know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate. Part of me is glad she got off that easy, we've all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that's all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it's fear motivating them to tell their tales. There's nothing they wouldn't give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they'd all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off. Yet that doesn't change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we're supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there's a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You'd think the death toll would've gone down after the first few years, but it's still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we're inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I's and cross our T's, we don't say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him. I don't have a question to ask this year. I knew the answer sometime late in July. There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to be on the naughty list, I'd sealed my fate. It was a normal get together, few couples around a friend's place for a dinner night. We all laughed at each other's jokes, we all complimented the way each other looked, stories that would be appropriate for a choir boy were told. It was good, sterile fun. But George, as ever, pushed his luck. This motherfucker for years, has been fondling my wife. Nothing overt, just a brush of the elbow against her tits as he brought her a new drink, or a trailing hand that slaps her on the ass. I have no idea how this prick had never made it onto the naughty list, even if it had happened in the old times people would've said it was egregious. But I never did anything, I never stood up for her, I never consoled her about it when we got home, and it remained unacknowledged, because we both hoped eventually he'd get put on that list. I saw the look on my wife's face, that helpless despair that makes her skin pallid, all because she knows she can't tell this creep to get bent. So, I hit him. Square in the jaw, he crumpled like an aluminum can, and we left. Claire, my wife, did nothing but cry on the way home. She knew what I'd done to myself. But when she resigned herself to my fate, she thanked me. Part of me hates her for that, cause there's a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me. I've had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out – no. I'm not that stupid. But in my half a year, I've found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I'm not saying I've been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I've lived. Undoubtedly, when this is found, I'll be dead, destroyed by some trap present that was left at the foot of my bed. So, Claire, my love, I want you to release this, post it online, send it to the news outlets, do whatever you want. Just make sure it gets out. People have to know that what they're doing ain't living. They're machines, just going from day to day with no hope of anything new or exciting ever happening, but being forced to deal with the same heart break year after year. I know it's scary to say fuck it, and know that your life is coming to an end, but hey, I only had five months, you'll have twelve! I can't tell you all how much fun I've had, how free I feel now. Don't be enslaved by the jolly prick any longer. Just stand up on the 26th and say what I've been screaming north for five months with some pride. Fuck you, Santa,", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

And I breathed. It felt good, but it hurt. I reached out and the arm handed me the red box connected to the mask. The training boxes were green.'Red. It's real. How long? What time is it?'I did n't know what to do. Yes I did. I began reciting greetings in the languages they taught us. I did n't make it passed Mandarin before another suit handed me a compad.

I took their advice and it was some of the worst stuff I've ever written. Nothing against their critiques; some of it is solid, but it does n't mesh with my writing style. I'm sorry, but I work best alone. \" \" Look, Nat, I did n't want to bring this up, but there are people who would kill for this position in this economy. I made it clear when you started that you'd be working in a team environment. If you ca n't at least let your team in on your creative process, I'm going to have to let you go. \" Shit. \" I'll try, \" she said, smiling weakly. God, she was already feeling nauseous, whether from the impending migraine or the thought of unemployment, she could n't tell. Better head to the break room and caffeine the worst of the headache away. As she poured herself some coffee in the Mickey Mouse mug her kids had gotten her for her birthday, she wondered where her dreams had gone. Half the point of college had been to hone her writing skills, to write something that would change someone's world. Maybe someday create her own magnum opus, something they would teach in high school literature classes where inept teachers would force unwilling students to find meaning and symbolism where Natalie only meant to describe a stand of trees or the color of wallpaper. Now her writing talents were wasted on presentations, shareholder reports and form letters for the higher-ups to sign en masse. She took a gulp of the burnt coffee. Her stomach balked at the thought of eating, but she could manage liquids for now. She had n't written creatively for... god, years now. Her days were taken up with work, her evenings with cooking dinner and going over homework, her nights with gently rebuffing her husband's advances because, dammit, could n't she have a half hour to herself before starting the cycle over? Even her weekends were booked. Kids could n't drive themselves to little league, dance recitals, and the inevitable sleepover. Her brain was a jumbled mass of other people's mess, their needs and emotions and petty obligations piling and crowding and tangling until she had no room to just breathe. Her only solace these days was gardening. It reminded her of a simpler time, growing up on her parents'farm. When she was younger, all she'd wanted was to escape the grueling labor, the smell of farm animals, and worst of all, the lack of culture. College had been the escape she needed. It was n't until after she graduated, after she got a job, a husband and two kids, that she realized all her best thinking had come when she was working at the farm. Milking animals and tilling soil left one physically busy but mentally bored, and her greatest ideas sprung from her unoccupied mind. What she would n't give for some kind of natural disaster. A tornado, or a flood, or a surprise eruption to disrupt the now, now, now of work and kids and neglected spouse. Better yet, let her do it. Give her a wrecking ball and she'd knock down this awful building. Hell, she'd knock them all down. Give her metal claws and she'd rip up the pavement, explore the earth trapped underneath. She'd till and plant, water and fertilize, and then simply wait. And watch. She'd cast off her business casual wear, trade them in for jeans, T-shirts and clunky brown boots as plants sprouted around her. Would she plant corn? Wheat? Vegetables? Wildflowers? It did n't matter, as long as there was finally quiet. She could picture it perfectly. Nothing in her sight but endless stretches of earth, plants, and sky. No wooden fence like at her parents'farm. No distant calls of farmhands. Not a sound to be heard apart from the birds chirping, the wind caressing leaves, and the occasional animal needing attention. But the closest, sweetest sound would be her pen scratching at an old, worn notebook. She finished her coffee, noting absently that her headache was down from a constant throb to a dull ache. Her chair waited in her cubicle, and she thumped tiredly into it. The blinking light on her phone caught her eye. Voicemail. Hopefully it was n't too important. She picked it up, dialed the number, and listened. \" Hey hon, it's me. I'm gon na be stuck late at work. Can you pick Josh up from baseball practice? Sorry, I know I said I'd cook tonight. I'll get you another night. See you at home. \" Natalie sighed. She'd give all of this up, if she could. But for now, she had her obligations.

{"input": "Create an Aesop-style fable for a modern-day lesson, complete with a moral", "output": "A wolf, finding itself alone and hungry in a wild fen, knew it must exploit the foolishness of prey or perish. Upon the bank of a nearby trickle creek a young human boy used a stick to draw pictures in the gritty sand. The boy drew pictures of swords and stars and heroic deeds in the yielding gray grit and imagined adventures and triumphs in the pink tinted clouds puffed in the blue regularity which had been been his constant definition of limit since the \" outside\" had been defined as other than that which was \" inside\" when first he was shown the sky by a father and mother who invested themselves in his future without definition of purpose or the imposition of fear. The wolf, being schooled in the ways of the world from fighting with Jackals and Kites for his meals and knowing the necessity of sacrificing the weak so the strong might survive, knew the boy was ripe for exploitation. What did the boy know of struggle? What did the boy know of real dreams? The pathetic imaginings of lesser creatures could not be allowed to come between the wolf and his need to survive. So, the wolf slowly approached the boy. Sometimes behind a rock, sometimes behind trees, the wolf approached and called to the boy: \" Yes, your dreams are great and important. The things you imagine will be great adventures and will help your people. Work for me and all of your dreams will come true.\" The young boy, foolish because of his lack of exposure to the real world and protected by his parents who only thought to make him a creature of rules and the advancement that comes with supplication, was eager to hear the wolf's words. \" What can I do to help you so that I might help myself and my people?\" asked the boy. \" Help me with my vision to help others and you will be a great leader in your pack\" said the wolf. \" What do I need to do?\" asked the boy. \" I just need a little bite of you every day for the next 30 years. If you can give me that your name will be written in the stars and the great adventures you imagined will unfold before you.\" said the wolf suppressing a smile. \" A little bite every day to help my friends and family? I'm in\" said the hard working boy. Decades passed and each day the wolf arrived at the fen and took a small bite of the boy. At this point, the boy had convinced his family, his friends, their family and people from other villages that the wolf had a great treasure on offer for those who would help the wolf pursue his great vision. Each day the wolf took a small bite from the friends, family and others the young boy had convinced to help the wolf. One day, the wolf and several wolf pups arrived at the great works which the labor of the boy and others had built at the wolf's direction. The wolf pups were large and healthy while the various humans who had labored for so long to pursue the wolf's vision were variously broken or exhausted or simply exploitable, non-thinking bio-machines available for use by those who had the knowledge to exploit for gain and cast aside when no longer useful. The wolf addressed the gathered \" family\" to extol their virtues and thank them for the many years of service which had helped him and his pack to grow wealthy and influential. Unfortunately, the pack had to seek other opportunities to continue to pursue the vision of service, quality and \" excellence\" that had defined the \" mission\" from the time the wolf had first wandered into the fen. \" Effective immediately the great works are closed, the relationship between wolves and men is ended and the inputs who have cohabited our temporal space are free to pursue their vision of self actualization.\" The wolves turned and walked out the gates built by the young boy, now old and gnarled by labor. The boy, now a \" supervisor\" characterized by his 100 hour work week with no life beyond his service to the wolves, stood at the gate to watch the wolves leave for the last time. \" Goodbye, Mister Wolfe. Good luck with the new project. I'm really going to miss you.\" said the boy now grown old and stooped from labor and obsequious deference. The wolf looked at the boy. The boy stood with downcast eyes and humble, slumped shoulders as he waited for the wolves to depart. It was touching, endearing, loyal and pathetic. \" Yeah, about that\" said the wolf smiling his whitest smile, \" You've been with us a long time and you know way too much for us to simply leave you behind. You really are like family. Though, not exactly\". At this point the wolf ripped out the boy's throat and left him to bleed to death at the gate. As the wolves drove away to pursue their new market and the blood of the young now old boy poured into the streets and drains of the production center built on the old fen, the pink tinted clouds overhead billowed and beckoned with promise. The sky had never been a more intense shade of blue and the ever whitening face of the young/old boy set old hearts to quaking and banked unguessed fires within young hearts grown within the shadow of casual dismissal and discounted value. I do n't think there is a moral for this story. Either you get the point or you do n't. So, wolf or worker? Do n't lie to yourself. Your gleaming teeth clearly give you away. Those who live after the next 100 years will rewrite this story. The wolves will be greater than ever or those who have built a world for the wolves will have cast them off. What does a world without wolves look like? I did n't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. Fight back or prepare your children's children to serve. Good luck. I'll see you on the other side.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}

I know that's weird but I just had to say it. Anyways I saw the video and hope you enjoy. P.S: Sorry it's so long: / I woke up so long ago here in this frost-covered forrest in a gown made of white leaves along with other foliage. I could n't tell you how long I've been here because of the obscure flow of time. The sun may shine for what seems to be days or seconds and the same is true for the moon. Time seems to slow down, pause, rewind, and speed up sporadically here in this forrest. Sometimes it snows and when it does the snow falls gently onto the floor. I've noticed that despite my lack of proper garments for the climate I only feel slightly cold as if something is repressing the intensity of it all. Before I came here I was with my boyfriend, Dall, by his cabin. He was 19 and I was 17. People always made fun of us since I was below the age of 18 which meant that we could n't legally have sex but I never minded and neither did he. He never pressured me when it came to stuff like that he was perfect. I remember his cabin was right next to a lake and we were outside on a bench watching the sunset. I was laid out on his lap staring at him and the sun as it kissed the lake. He looked at me with those tender eyes of his and bent down to kiss me tenderly. That was when I awoke here. I wander through the woods for as long as I can, and when I grow tired I plant myself down somewhere and sleep. I stopped waiting for the moon to meet me to sleep; it's just too unreliable. As I wander through this forrest I'm always surrounded by towering trees that are clad with snow and wade through the even patch that rises just above my ankles. There are no landmarks so I started marking the trees to find if I'm going in circles... I'm not. It's just one endless forrest that seems to go on forever and never deviates. My only company here is the wolves. They too are came all in white ( It seems that only the barks and leaves of the trees are n't white ). At first I was completely filled with fear when I saw them, but each meeting is the same as the last. I always seem to find them in roughly the sam position. Seven wolves sniffing about, digging at the ground, or laying on the snow in the distance and one wolf, both larger and whiter, with yellow eyes only twenty feet away from me. I know he's the alpha. There's always an air about him that speaks of dominance and noble strength. Every time I come upon the pack I find him looking off somewhere and then turning towards me. He acknowledges my presence without any movement at all and with that look it's as if he says \" You're not one of us,\" and then he bounds away with his pack behind him. I love him the most. I like to think that he's looking for someone too. I wish I knew how long I've been here. I'm beginning to grow bored with the monotony of it all. It's the meetings with the pack and their alpha that I live for. So I run and run until I meet them. They always stay for the same amount of time. Too short is our encounter. He gazes at me and then bolts away as I stand there as I always do watching him go off. The moon's out right now and the stars are sprinkled across the sky, each shining with it's own magnificent and holy light. I love the night more than the day I realize. Before I feared it the most and dreaded when it, when it came. Before I associated it the night with monsters and beasts, now I associate it with beauty and the majesty of the wolves. Their coats look absolute and perfect as the moonlight kisses their fur. When I dream I sometimes dream that the alpha comes to me and snuggles up by my side as we gaze out at the stars. When I wake up I decided it's time to change things up a bit. So I walk through the heavy snow and take frequent breaks. I conserve all the energy I have until finally I come upon him with his bright yellow eyes once again. He turns to look at me and then bolts away, but this time I give chase. I sprint with all my might and follow him as he weaves between the trees with natural grace and speed. I can here the rustle of my marble white gown of leaves and do my best to keep him within my sight. I'm among his pack-mates but they do n't worry me because they too have their eyes trained on him. He takes one look back then stops in his tracks. He sits down and stares at me with those eyes that are as full of apathetical wisdom as the floor is covered with snow. I'm hesitant of what to do and then realize that he wants me to approach him. So slowly I walk towards him trying to be as graceful as he. I'm so close to him that I can feel his hot breath against my hand and slowly and delicately place my hand on his head. He stands up on all fours letting my hand slip away and barks to his back. They moan and whine but soon disperse. He motions for me to follow and I do. We walk together side by side. Eventually we happen upon an old cabin that has it's wooden walls broken in with rot. It stands a heavy contrast of dark oak amongst the pristine white of the omnipresent snow. Slowly we walk inside the old abandoned thing and find that the inside is just as bad as the outside, but there's something so hauntingly beautiful about it's state of disrepair. I see a staircase and walk up until I'm in a room void of all furniture. The only facet of the room is a dusty old window. I walk towards it to look outside with the alpha behind me looking about. I gaze out at the all too familiar scene and here slight cracking. I take half-step back and find the the window cracked. Then the crack spreads and grows faster and faster until the window explodes and I'm covered in cuts. I'm on the floor searing with pain. Alpha walks up to me and licks a wound I blink as he does and when I open my eyes I see Dall without a shirt, his chest and arms covered with markings of blue paint and wearing a necklace of teeth... wolves teeth. On his head is the head of a wolf and I realize he's the alpha. He was searching for me and wanted me to follow him. I was what he lost. The beauty of the realization brings tears to my eyes and he picks me up with his strong and delicate hands and carries me out of the house. He lays me in the snow outside and looks at me with concern as I tear up again with joy. He touches my face face delicately to asses the damage and I pull him towards me with my wounds healed and kiss him hard with love and joy and profound happiness. Our embrace is impossible to break and when I open my eyes I'm in a bed with the blankets over staring up at Dall. \" What happened?\" I asked groggy and confused. \" You fell asleep during the sunset so I carried you to bed,\" he smiles. \" I had the craziest dream,\" \" You were only out for a bit you could n't have dreamt of much.\" he said with that adorable grin of his. \" No I dreamt of everything,\" and once more I brought him towards me and kissed him hard know that this time when I opened my eyes he would still be there as he was.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
{"input": "You are a parkourist of intermediate skill, describe a day in your life after the Zombie Apocalypse.", "output": "\" Batteries?\" \" Who would have thought that fucking batteries would be my number one priority,\" I think to myself while monkey-vaulting over the police barrier. But it was true. The zombie's were a lot less scary than the movies made it seem-especially for those of us who were in shape and took a second to think. Sure, it was a bit harder to Parkour wearing all leather and a motorcycle helmet, but have YOU ever tried to bite through a leather jacket? Fucking impossible, and YOUR gums are n't even slowly rotting away to nothing. No, the zombies-huge numbers of them everywhere, are more of an annoyance than an apocalypse. It all started out pretty slowly. Somebody posted a story on Reddit that most people thought was a joke. A few shopkeepers got some phone calls, but the media told everybody that it was just a hoax. Turned out it was n't. It slowly spread from the bumfuck towns in the midwest to the more populated cities. At first, most of the damage was done by the uninfected. People began panicking, looting, and acting crazy as shit even before we had a real feel for what was going on. Most of the forces that were brought into the cities were used to protect the people from themselves. Pretty sad if you think about it. Once we were able to calm down the crazies and restore some semblance of order, barricades were placed, sections of the cities were fortified, and resources were rationed. Then, some of the brightest minds that were left set out to find a solution to the zombie problem. Ended up not being necessary at all. See, zombies are n't what we all though they would be. Sure they are walking dead, but they are still made up of skin, bone, and flesh. There is enough ammunition in the USA to kill every man woman and child on the planet a few times over. This came in handy until we realized that it was just a waste of time. The zombies in the north completely froze. The ones in the mid-west dried up and crumbled into dust. The ones in the more temperate regions that could n't find food, were n't able to see once their eyes ran out of water, so they just stumbled around aimlessly. The ones that were n't eaten from the outside by all the stray cats, dogs, birds, and rats-were eaten from the inside by all the maggots and worms. The stench was nauseating but the danger was slim. By the time the few zombies that were left even had a chance to get close to you, their gums had rotten away so badly that any teeth they had pretty much fell out. Sometimes it could take you a second or two to slip away if one grabbed a hold of you, especially if they were a bit on the obese-side before they changed. I was stuck under one for a good 10 minutes once until I finally got the zipper in my jacket loose from the hooks on the front of her bra. Things are still pretty much at a standstill though. The power had stayed on in a lot of places in the city, and the government got the internet back up and the water turned on pretty recently. Life was almost back to normal except nobody had to go to work until after the government was sure they had a lid on things. Estimates were a minimum of 6 months, but I heard it could be at least 2 years until we got the go ahead. Except for the zombies, life was a little more laid back. Most people now had the time to do the things they had been putting off for years. Most of the obese people that were left, saw what a disadvantage it was in an emergency and began working out. My girlfriend started dancing again. And me? Well... I Parkour. I've gotten a lot better since this quote-unquote zombie apocalypse started. Which is why I need to find a place that has batteries. Sure we have food, and water, and power, and the internet. But anything that needs to be shipped or trucked in has n't been and wo n't be until this is all over. Batteries.

Ever since the happening every high performance athlete had to hide as the world crumbled upon itself in it's search for power.

The Olympic Wars happened years ago, what is left of earth is merely a shadow of what it once was. Society as we used to know does n't exist anymore, we live scattered in a destroyed ruin the we used to call world. And I was OK with it until last month. We believed that all the Olympians had died during the war, until I saw him, I was near a lake somewhere north of what I guess used to be New York. He just appeared out of the blue, jumped into the lake and started swimming. I had only listened to tales about the Olympians, I could not quite grasp what I saw, he ripped through the calm water with such easy that it took me sometime to realize I was looking at a human. I was not sure who he was at that time, but I followed him when he left the lake. After following him for no more than 10 minutes he suddenly stopped and pulled a half hidden rope from within the vegetation. It rolled up with him and I could finally understand, there was a fairly large tree house just above my head. I spent days living near his house. I had to understand what was so special about that guy, I had to know I was not dreaming, I had to be sure he was what the legends used to say.

I was ready to leave, there was no need to risk my life for the essence of a regular human. When I turned my back to jump back out the window I realized my mistake. Behind me, right beside the window was a big shelf, in it there was a set of small golden circles and a feel golden cups. Just as the legend said, every Olympian carried with then a series of wierd golden objects. My suspicion was right, I had found a Olympian, probably the last of then. In the shelf I finally understood who that was as I read Michael Phelps in every single one of the tokens. Before I could set my mind straight he was there, probably came up using the rope when I was checking the shelf. He never moved a muscle, and I did n't have a second thought, without looking I grabbed the closest golden cup and threw it at him. The cup flew half a meter to his right, aiming was never my biggest strength, but it was enough, he took a step back in fear and feel down the hole on the floor. I ca n't remember the details of what followed, but as soon as I touched his body I could feel it, power ran through my veins. And I finally understood how he could swim like that, it was like having a motor in my body, I looked down and I could see, it was my penis, it could n't stop spinning.", "task_type": "creative_writing"}
